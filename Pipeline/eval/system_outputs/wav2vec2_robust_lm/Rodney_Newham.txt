MY NAME IS RODNEY NEWNHAM AND I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND THEN I E WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN I HAD AN APPRENTICESHIP IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD AND FOR FIVE YEARS AND THEN I SERVED A TIME ON MOST OF THE SHIPS THAT CAME IN ON A REPAIRING I WAS IN THE BOILER MAKING TRADE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THE BOILER ROOMS AND ENGINE ROOMS WERE THEY THE ONES THAT I WAS EMPLOYED IN AND I KNEW MORE ABOUT SHIPS THAN SOME OF THE SAILORS KNEW CAUSE I USED TO KNOW EVERY PART OF THE SHIP EVEN DOWN INTO THE THE SHAFT ROOM THE CHART IT GOES THROUGH AND DRIVES A PROPELLER AND THEN AND THE ONE OF MY JOBS WAS TO PUT SAFETY AND SHIELD OVER THE JOINTS OF THE SHAFT GOING THROUGH THE SHIP AND I KNEW ABOUT MOST OF THE SHIPS AND WERE DIFFERENT THE ENGINE AND BOILER ROOMS MORE THAN ANYTHING AND THE AIR SUPPLIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN WE SAT IN EXAMS FOR ARTIFICER APPRENTICES OR DOCKYARD APPRENTICES AND AT THAT TIME I WANTED TO GO INTO THE NAVY BUT IN THAT AT THAT TIME THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT YOU IN THE AS A ENGINE ROOM ARTICLE IF YOU HAD GLASSES BECAUSE THE SHIPS IN THOSE DAYS A LOT TEAM CAME FROM THE BOILERS SO YOU NEVER YOU COULDN'T DO IT SO I TOOK I WENT THEN AS AN APPRENTICE IN IN IN IN CHATTER DOCKYARD AND SERVED FIVE YEARS AT WAS A NINETEEN THIRTY SIX IN THOSE DAYS WHEN YOU EVEN WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF THE DOCKYARD GATES CHILDREN WERE BEGGING THERE IN BARE FEET FOR YOUR SANDWICHES THAT YOU HAD OVER AND YOU USED TO GIVE EM TO THE CHILDREN WHO WERE THERE A WAITING FOR THE DOCKYARD PEOPLE TO COME OUT SO THAT THEY COULD GET THESE SO SANDWICHES IT DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE DOES IT BUT THAT'S TRUE YES I HAD A SISTER WHO WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD AND I HAD A BROTHER WHO WAS SEVEN YEARS YOUNGER AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM I NEVER KNEW I NEVER KNEW BUT MY SISTER SHE SHE LIVED TO ABOUT EIGHTY THREE I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT HER WHEN MY SISTER YES AND AND MY MY FATHER WAS A CHIEF ENGINE ROOM ARTISTE IN A NAVY HE DID HIS TWENTY TWO YEARS YOU KNOW AND AM AND MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS EIGHT SO I NEVER REALLY KNEW HER MOTHER'S LOVE AND CARE FROM THE AGE OF EIGHT NO SO I CAN'T SAY THAT I HAD A HAPPY CHILDHOOD AS SUCH NOW IT HAVING A MOTHER'S CARE WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF YOUR EARLY APPRENTICESHIP IN IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD WHAT WERE YOU ACTUALLY WAS THERE A SENSE OF WAR I MEAN WERE YOU AND WAS IT BACK WE WERE YOU BUILDING UP THE WALL OR WAS IT JUST YOU KNOW A JOB FOR YOUR TIME WELL I WAS NINETEEN THIRTY SIX I WENT INTO THE DOCKYARD AS AN APPRENTICE OF FURTHER FIVE YEARS APPRENTICESHIP THIRTY SIX SO IN THAT TIME THE WAR BROKE OUT OF THIRTY NINE DIDN'T IT THAT'S RIGHT AND THE SO I WAS SERVING THE APPRENTICESHIP ACTUALLY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT YES WELL IT WAS A WHEN I FINISHED I CAME I WAS THEN A QUALIFIED BOILER MAKER WHICH WAS A HARD JOB HARD WORK SO I I DETERMINED AT THAT TIME THAT I WOULDN'T STAY AS A BALE MAKER SO I MADE PROGRESS IN THE TRADE AND I EVENTUALLY BECAME AN INSPECTOR OF TRADES IN THE IN THE DOCKYARD THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I RETIRED AS AN INSPECTOR OF TRADES AND IT'S HER THE APPRENTICESHIP OF THE BOILER MAKER WAS A HARD JOB IT WAS A HEAVY HEAVY MATERIAL JOB YET YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT THE BOILERS THEY WEREN'T MODERN THEY WERE WHAT WE USED TO CALL YARROW BOILERS AND CYLINDRICAL BOILERS MADE OF METAL ABOUT AN INCH THICK AND WE USED TO ROLL IT INTO SHAPE AND LATER THEY WERE BIG OVER UP TO THIRTY TON CASE THE THE CRANES USED TO HAVE TO LIFT THAT YES AND IT WAS IT WAS A HEAVY HARD WORK BOWLER MAKING WAS YES I'VE UNKNOWN OF A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED WHEN ONE HE HAD A PLATE DROPPED FROM A CRANE A SLIP SLIPPED OUT OF THE OF THE GRIP AND FELL ON HIM AND KILLED HIM YES A TERRIBLE AND DONE AND I REMEMBER A MAN BEING KILLED ON THE AM THE CRANES USED TO GO UP AND DOWN ON RAILS LIFTING IF IT ABOUT LIFTING THIRTY ODD TONGUE UNDER ONE MAN WAS CRUSHED UP ON THE LINE AND IT WAS A IT WAS A NAVAL OFFICER WHO ACTUALLY WENT UP THERE UP THE STEPS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE STEPS WERE LOCKED SO THAT NO OTHER PEOPLE COULDN'T GET BUT HE WENT OUT THERE TO RETRIEVE THE BODY OR TO SEE IF HE COULD DO ANYTHING FOR THE BODY A VERY BRAVE MAN A NAVAL OFFICER LEFTENANT HE WAS IT'S AS PLAIN AS IF IT WAS YESTERDAY YES YES HE WAS A AND E THE IT WAS HARD SOMETHING I'M QUITE INTERESTED IN RODNEY IS OBVIOUSLY CHASE BECAME A VERY VERY BUSY DOCKYARD DURING THE WAR YES DID YOU NOTICE YOU KNOW DID YOU NOTICE TO TALK A BIT ABOUT THIS ESCALATION IN THE AMOUNT OF WORK IN TERMS OF PROVIDING FOR THE WAR EFFORT AND WELL THERE WAS A NUMBER OF VESSELS USED TO COME IN FOR DAMAGE BECAUSE OF WAR AND THEY WOULD BE REPAIRED IN IN DOIN IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD AND THEN AND THEY WERE USED TO DO MAKE A GUN SHIELDS AND A TORPEDO PLATFORMS TO THAT REVOLVED FOR THE TORPEDOES ON AND WE USED TO DO LOSE AND MAKE THOSE PLATFORMS FOR TORPEDO TO BE FIRED FROM AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND GUN SHIELDS WE USED TO MAKE MADE OF A BULLET PROOF OF METAL WHICH WAS VERY HARD TO WORK WITH YOU KNOW BEEN HARD YOU DID BECAME HERE THE ARE SOUSA WAS A CRUISE I WORKED ON AND THE LONDON WITH ANOTHER CRUISER AND A AND A NUMBER OF FRIGATES AND A MINE SWEEPERS AND THEN WHEN WE USED TO DO THE REFITS AND THAT WOULD MEAN STRIPPING OUT THE BOILER AND ENGINE ROOMS AND RENEWING A LOT OF THE STUFF THE A E AIR SUPPLY A THROUGH THE VENTILATIONS AND TO THE ENGINE AND BOILER ROOMS THROUGH A TURBO GENERA IT WAS THAT COLLECTED THE AIR AND DISTRIBUTED IT ROUND THE SHIP YES THAT WAS ALL ALUMINIUM TRUNK IN WITH GROWS ON THE END OF THE TRUNK IN YOU COULD ALTER THE DIFFERENT POSITIONS IN THE ENGINE AND BOILER ROOMS YES I USED TO MAKE THOSE GROWS AND FIT THEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT I REMEMBER THE GERMANS COMING OVER WITH QUITE A NUMBER OF THEM AND I REMEMBER THAT THE AIR AND THE ARITHUZA THE CRUISER OPEN OPEN FIRE ON THEM AND I THINK I THINK A LOT OF THE CRAFT WERE ITALIANS I THINK THAT CAME OVER BECAUSE IT WAS NOTICEABLE THAT THE GERMANS WOULD HAVE GONE ON BUT WHEN THE ARITHUSAR OPENED FIRE ON THEM A LOT OF THESE PLANES CHANGED AND TURNED ROUND AND WENT BACK FROM WHERE THEY COME FROM YOU NEED NEVER BELIEVE IT WOULD YOU BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED YES THE GERMANS WOULD HAVE KEPT ON AND WOULD HAVE ATTACKED THEIR TARGET I THINK SOME OF THE OTHERS WERE ITALIANS OR YES BECAUSE WELL I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN IN A SHELTER I STOOD UP AGAINST ONE OF THE WORKSHOP WALLS AND THAT WAS MY SHELTER AND WATCHED THE ARITHUSA OPEN UP ON AS SHE WAS IN DOCK AND SHE OPENED UP AND I STOOD THERE WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL OF THE WORKSHOP AND AND SAW THESE MEN ON THE ARITHUSLA STRIPPED TO THE WAIST FIRING THE SHIPS AND GETTING THE SHELL EMPTY SHELLS AND THROWING THEM ASIDE AND UNLOADING AGAIN AND FIRING THAT WAS ON THE ARITHUTLA YES THEY WERE A REALLY GOOD THEY WERE THEY REALLY REALLY TURNED THE PLAINS ROUND AND EXPERIENCE IN AS I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DOWN IN A SHELTER AND I DIDN'T GO DOWN THERE YES I WAS GIVEN ONE TO GO TO WHICH WAS JUST A WHERE I HAD DUG OUT AND YOU WENT DOWN STEPS AND A THAT WAS THERE BUT I WOULDN'T GO DOWN THE THING AND I STOOD WITH ME BACK TO THE WALL OF THE WORKSHOP YES NOT THAT I WAS BRAVE AT ALL I JUST SAID I WOULDN'T GO DOWN A SHELTER I'D RATHER TAKE THE CHANCE NOW YES IN THE WAR WHEN YOU WEREN'T IN THE DOCKYARD OR WERE YOU LIVING IN THE DOCKYARD AS WELL NOW I AM I LIVED OUTSIDE OF THE DOCKYARD YES I LIVED IN GILLINGHAM ROAD FOR A TIME A NEAR THE RAILWAY CROSSING YOU KNOW THAT PART OF GILLINGHAM AND I LIVED WITH MY FATHER THERE YES CAUSE MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS EIGHT BUT I WENT WITH MY DAD WE I THINK WE KNEW THAT WE WOULD PUT IT LIKE THIS WOULD WIN IN THE END YOU KNOW AND THAT WE WOULD BE THE VICTORS AS A NATION BECAUSE SO I THINK THE EFFORT WHICH EVERYBODY WAS BEHIND THE WAR EFFORT AS FAR AS I KNOW YES YES ME THAT I SUPPOSE YOU SIR YOU AS YOU WEREN'T PAID A LOT OF MONEY AND YOU WANT SOME PEOPLE MADE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE OF THE WAR THAT AN BUT WE WERE NEVER LIKE THAT WE NEVER MADE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE OF THE WAR BEING ON AND IT WAS HARD WORK BUT WE A GREAT BIG SLAB THAT I USED TO DO THINGS ON AND WITH A VOICE A HEAVY VOICE ONE END OF IT AND I USED TO ROLL PLATES AND CYLINDERS OUT OF AN INCH THICK MATERIAL AND THE AND USED TO WORK IN THE FURNACE AND PULL A PULL HER RINGS OUT OF THE FURNACE AND ROUND EM UP AND YOU USED TO HAVE TO HAVE AN ASBESTOS SHEET TO SHIELD YOURSELF FROM THE HEAT THAT CAME OFF WHEN YOU PULLED IT OUT WE RACES ON TO A SLAB FROM THE FURNACE AND THE HEAT WAS SO GREAT THAT YOU USED TO HOLD THIS ASPECT OF SHEETS UP IN FRONT OF YOU TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE HEAT AS YOU ENDEAVOURED WITH A LARGE LARGE HAMMERS TO SHAPE A LOT TO TO AND MAKE THEM INTO A RIGHT SHAPE SOMETIMES THEY WEREN'T QUITE ROUND AND SO YOU HAD TO PUT DOGS ON THEM AND AND SHAPE THEM IF YOU JUST HAD ASPECT OF SHEETS TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE HEAT AND THE THING WAS THAT YOU AS YOU YOU YOU MADE THINGS OUT OF ASBESTOS SHEETS AND YOU JUST SAW IT
