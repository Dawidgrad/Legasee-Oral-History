after operation torch and some of the maltese convoys were done you started doing more atlantic work is that right yes we done a few atlantic convoys they were always worried about the german battleships that were at loose in the atlantic so we done a bit of time in the atlantic prior to that we escorted the arc royal up when they were chasing the bismarck we were involved in that as well tell me about that we'd heard that the hood had been sunk that gave us all a bit of a shock really because we thought the hood was the most powerful ship in the navy which it was you know it had eight fifteen inch guns compared to our six it just disappeared there were three survivors whom we didn't know back then and we were down in gibraltar the arc royal sheffield and us we headed up there to try and cut the bismarck off to stop them getting oppressed in northern france and eventually it was sited by catalina the aircraft and we saw the arc royal's aircraft taking off and that was a mighty thing the ship was going up and down thirty foot in the air that was a mighty bit of flying there then of course the admiral sent the sheffield to go and shadow the bismarck but he didn't tell the arc royal so the arc royal saw sheffield and thought that was going to attack the bismarck so they started firing at the sheffield but luckily the magnetic fuses on the torpedo weren't working properly and they all passed underneath the sheffield she had a lucky escape she nearly got sunk with her own aircraft then they all came back and reloaded the torpedoes and they put contact pistols on them so the torpedo would have to hit the ship in order for them to explode so they took off again and they knew the sheffield was there this time and the sheffield directed them onto the bismarck and they hit the bismarck around the rudder area of the ship and disabled it really it was going around in circles the admiral on renown was dying to get involved to have a crack at it ourselves but we were told to lay off till the biggest rkg and rodney came up because i think the admiralty were scared after the hood had been sunk with one shot we could have been sunk as well you know we were looking after the arc royal so if we weren't looking after her she could have been sunk in the middle of it all during the bismarck action there was a german u boat returning to base and he was in the area he had the arc royal and renown in his sights but he ran out of torpedoes he could have sunk the two of us did you see the bismarck no we didn't see the bismarck we were close by you know they were lucky really because they nearly ran out of fuel they was lucky that they were able to catch up with her really otherwise if it came to it we could have been the last ship which would mean we would have had to go in and attack her we might have had a better chance because she wasn't steering very well she was going round in circles she was eventually sunk i can recall a funny story after that a friend of mine was on one of the destroyers and they picked up some of these german survivors from the bismarck and of course all the ships had to head for the uk some were sunk on the way back actually because some were running out of fuel this chap he was put on the milford haven in the deaden night they were told first thing in the morning to land these german prisoners and he said we blindfolded all these german prisoners before they went ashore you see and he said we didn't even know where we were ourselves none of them had a clue where they were we had to blindfold all these german soldiers so they didn't see anything but we didn't know where we were anyway only the captains knew where they were
