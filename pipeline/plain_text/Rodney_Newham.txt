my name is rodney newham and i was born in nineteen twenty and i when i was fifteen i had an apprenticeship in chatham dockyard and for five years and then i served a time on most of the ships that came in on repairing i was in the boiler making trade more than anything else the boiler rooms and engine rooms were the ones that the ones i was employed in and i knew more about the ships than some of the sailors knew because i used to know every part of the ship even down into the shafts room the room of the shaft which goes through and drives the propeller and one of my jobs was to put safety shields over the joints of the shaft going through the ship i knew about most of the ships were all different the engine and boiler rooms more than anything and the air supplies and things like that when i was about fifteen we sat in exams for artisan apprentices or dockyard apprentices and at that time i wanted to go into the navy but at that time they wouldn't accept you in the as an engine room artificer if you had glasses because ships in those days a lot of steam come from the boilers so you never you couldn't do it so i went in as an apprentice in chatham dockyards and served five years that was nineteen thirty six in those days even when you came out of the dockyard gates children were begging there in bare feet for your sandwiches that you had over and you used to give them to the children who were there waiting for the dockyard people to come out so that they could get these sandwiches it doesn't seem possible does it but that's true yes i had a sister who was seven years older and i had a brother who was seven years younger and what happened to him i never knew i never knew but my sister she lived until about eighty three i think something like that with my sister yes and my father was a chief engineer in art in the navy he did his twenty two years you know and my mother died when i was eight so i never really knew a mother's love and care from the age of eight no so i can't say that i had a happy childhood as such not having a mother's care what do you remember of your early apprenticeship at chatham dockyard what were you actually was there a sense of war were you were you building up to war or was it just a job for you at the time well at nineteen thirty six i went into the dockyard as an apprentice a five years apprenticeship thirty six in that time the war broke out at thirty nine that's right and so i was serving the apprenticeship actually when the war broke out yes when it was when i finished i was then a qualified boiler maker which was a hard job hard work so i determined at that time that i wouldn't stay as a boiler maker so i made progress in the trade and i eventually became an inspector of trades in the dockyard that's what i retired as an inspector of trades it's a the apprenticeship of a boiler maker was a hard job it's a heavy heavy material job if you can imagine the boilers they weren't modern they were what we used to call the arrow boilers cylindrical boilers made of metal an inch thick and we used to roll it into shape imagine they were big they were up to thirty ton the cranes used to have to lift that yes it was heavy hard work boiler making was yes i know of a number of people that were killed when one of them he had a plate dropped from a crane it slipped out of the grip fell on him and killed him yes it were terrible and i remember a man being killed on the cranes used to go up and down on rails lifting the heavy well lifting thirty odd tons and one man was crushed up in the night and it was a naval officer who actually went up there up the steps as you can imagine the steps were locked so that no that other people couldn't get up but he went up there to retrieve the body or to see if he could do anything more for the body a very brave man a naval officer lieutenant he was as plain as if it were yesterday yes yes yes and it was hard did you notice did you notice to talk a bit about this escalation in the amount of work in terms of providing for the war effort well there were a number of vessels that used to come in damaged because of the war and they would be repaired in chatham dockyard and and they we used to do make gun shields and torpedo platforms that revolved for the torpedoes on and we used to do those and make those platforms for torpedoes to be fired from and things like that and gun shields we used to make made of bulletproof metal which was very hard to work with you know bit hard any other came in yeah the arethusa was a cruise i worked on and the was another cruiser and a number of riggers and mine sweepers and then when we used to do the re fits and that would mean stripping out the boiler engine rooms and renewing a lot of the stuff the air supply through the ventilations down to the engine and boiler rooms through turbo generators collecting the air and distributing it around the ship yes that was called aluminum trunking with grills on the end of the trunking and you could alter the different positions through the engines in the boiler rooms yes i used to make those grills and fit them and things like that i remember the germans coming over was quite a number of them i remember the and the arethusa the cruiser opened fire on them and i think i think a lot of the craft were italians on there that had came over because it was noticeable that the germans would have gone on but when the arethusa opened fire on them a lot of these planes changed and turned round and went back from where they come from you'd never believed would you but that's what happened yes the germans would have kept on and would have attacked their target but i think that some of the others were italians on there yes because where i should have been down under the shelter i stood up against one of the workshop walls and that was my shelter and watched the arethusa open up as she was in dock and she opened up and i was stood there with my back to the wall in the workshop and i saw these men on the arethusa stripped to the waist firing the ships and getting the shells empty shells and throwing them aside and loading again and firing that was on the arethusa yes they were really good they were they really really turned those planes around an experience course i ought to been down in the shelter but i didn't go down there yes i was given one to go to it was just a well it was a dugout and you went down steps and that was there but i wouldn't go down there i stood with my back to the wall in the workshop yes not that i was brave at all it's just that i wouldn't go down the shelters i'd rather take a chance in the war when you weren't in the dockyard or were you living in the dockyard as well no i lived i lived outside of the dockyard yes i lived in gillingham road for a time near the railway crossing you know that part of gillingham and i lived with my father there yes cos' because my mother died when i was eight but i went and lived with my dad i think we knew that we'd put it like this that we'd win in the end that we would be the victors as a nation because i think that the effort everybody was behind the war effort as far as i know yes yes i suppose it was you weren't paid a lot of money you some people made a lot of money because of the war but we were never like that we never made a lot of money because of the war being on and it was hard work these great big slabs i used to do things on with a vice a heavy vice one end of it and i used to roll plates and cylinders out of inch thick material and i used to work in the furnace and pull rings out of the furnace and round em up and you used to have to have an asbestos sheet to shield yourself from the heat that came off when you pulled it out with rakes onto a slab out from the furnace and the heat was so great that you used to hold these asbestos sheets up in front of you to protect yourself from the heat as you endeavoured with hammers large large hammers to shape to to make them into the right shape sometimes they weren't quite round and so you had to put dogs on them and shape them you just had asbestos sheets to protect yourself from the heat and the thing was that you was you made things out of asbestos sheets and you just saw it up and all the dust well you just breathed it all in no wonder so many men died of asbestos it's a i had what they call plague in both lungs which i've got now but it never it never solidified men used to breathe it and it would go solid in the lungs but i was fortunate in that mine didn't solidify so it hasn't affected me the breathing even up to well now of course it does i was fortunate because many many of my colleagues died at an early age because of asbestos yes i remember them they were compensated a penny for it and i've never asked for compensation and i've never i've never worried about it because i thought well i have been breathing all these years and with no affect so i'm fortunate and with regard to convoys and stuff what did you know about the work that you were doing about keeping convoys going not a lot really no we didn't know a lot we didn't get a lot of information except what we read in the papers you know we just did our daily work you know cos' i had to we had to join the home guard so very often it was a matter of coming home from work and going out to the home guard yes which was on beety avenue where we had a place it was beety avenue where we used to sleep at night then we'd be called out they called it the z batteries and they were rockets and you loaded the rockets and fired at night you know and there were there was two projectors and you had to load them onto a projector which had two and you was given the elevation and that over the phone and you did that and then they would give you the word fire and you'd pull the lever and these two rockets went up from each side and there was about there was about must have been fifty of these z battery rockets on one field on beety avenue if i remember and you was firing at the aircraft and you'd hear them but you could never see them cos' it was at night mostly and during the day the batteries were made by regular soldiers you know and the home guard would do it in the evening yes hear any i never heard of any no to tell you the truth i never heard them we'd actually made a hit it was yes so there was two people on each one and you'd get the the rocket was in bunks a number of them and you would draw one out ooh they were heavy yes that big yes they were heavy too and i think they were t and t and they were heavy and you'd run and pick one up and load it onto the rocket and there'd be two the rocket and you would hear over the phone what elevation you had to set the rocket to or the shell to or rocket whatever you like to call it you'd do that and then you'd hear the elevation and that over the phone and then they'd say fire and you'd press down and these two went up there was a number of them on the field there must have been well it's a job to say now after all this time but quite a number and the town's people used to say they made a terrific noise when they went off you know when they were all fired at the same time and not a lot not a lot there must have been great celebrations yes i can't remember a lot about it to tell the truth oh cos' we had home guard uniforms and we were allowed to keep that and i used to wear the trousers to work for ages and ages i wore those home guard trousers dirty job boiler making was yes can i ask you a question about pembroke house can i ask you about pembroke house yes how do you find living here in pembroke house one of the best places you could be really yes its uh yes i didn't really imagine that i would be here but it's the best the best that you can i think well its the uh caring i think is the thing yes pembroke house and i remember it of course when it was a girls it was a naval children girls it was a girls home pembroke house was when i was a boy and i remember the girls being in their little sailors uniform it was yes it was true that's what pembroke house was it was for children girls mostly girls who's fathers had been killed or some reason or other you know that's what they were the girls yeah pembroke house was a girls yes a girls home ex naval people's children
