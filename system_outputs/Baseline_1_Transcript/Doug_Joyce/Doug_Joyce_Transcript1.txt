my name is douglas george joyce i was in the navy i finished when at the end of it i remained an able seaman all the time i didn't intend staying in the navy and that because it wasn't my cup of tea as such but why did you decide to join the navy in the first place oh my father he was in the army in the bowl war he was in the north west frontier with allowances six lances and he was in the battle of mons in france he said they were wallowing in mud he said boots have been full of water all the time that is and that's why he advised me to join the navy he said could at least he said when how you can get to your mess deck he said you will you'll get your meals nice and hot and you also have your clean hammock and all that cause we tussling over the over the top of the mastic a hammers you know and i took his advice and it was good advice in one way because i mean i was up all that land on for three years roughly and not once did a bullet even hit the ship not once there must have been a guardian angel watching airship i'm sure and what what was it like going from being a sort of a london boy the side to becoming a naval person well i mean a board the ship there we had all mixed here we had londoners we had georges scotch we had a mixture crew and we all got on well together a gone well you have to because he's no way you can run to you had to sort of am be sociable with everybody that did what what i mean is what was your lights should have been you know you've taken this advice sir what were you doing before you became a sailor what was your job what was i doing i'd done many jobs i was in i went in the building trade in the end you now because there was short of building workers and that and the one place we helped to build was a cause the there were shorter water tanks because that far in london they didn't know enough tanks for the water there and bonnie row and all them places and so they started building water tanks as what we were doing what they done they built the tank in lot weather where they had basements then they lined it all round with like a five or stuff so the water don't go through it and they had spare water tanks which which as was a help went away in a one one we built was down by am the save shasbury theatre there's one near the well it's still we it's gone now i suppose be little flats are nearly out but did you did you find that you know you were a builder in london how did you like the sort of going from that to the discipline and your training oh ye where did you train i trained at tom a m s glendora up in wales at fewelli and that was the place that was for willy we went we had to go two of us had to go with five rounds each in in our rifle go out to the point cause there as a nine point seven gun near which we used to practice on gunnery practice and it and we our job was to guard it like a lie we we we done is two or three nights didn't see a soul and i always thought was rabbits so i sent my mate next time we in for well as we'd buy some snares it's no you we get the rabbits and flog em and that's what we done and the farmer used to buy em off of us and they gave us pocket money and the blow said there where you get romps it up in the point there so i 'd begun with me case anybody case we got invaded i've been five rounds of ammunition a german landing craft came as surely wouldn't stand unearthly would we it's a well it's some it i think in the navy because you're in close contact all the time you know it's it's not like any army you can go walk out the main gate and go ashore or its only the navy you can't you your dole and what is it whatever your saddle with your saddle and you got to make the best of it
