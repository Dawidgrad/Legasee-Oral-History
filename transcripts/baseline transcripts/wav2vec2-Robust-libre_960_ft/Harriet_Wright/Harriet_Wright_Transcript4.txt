where were you aware you are it would have been i'd joined up july forty three so i would have got there at august probably forty three august forty three then he was there for quite several months and now quite a quarter while from there i was posted to barogerny near bristol and that was a hospital for more or less shell shot a service well navy personel really are and marines and and so forth and i was mostly on night watch there it was only just prior to going to westfield college and every night every hour there was a i think he might have been either p r a s p o a complete with gun used to do the rounds making sure that none of the inmates had escaped for instance because they were all rather shell shop do you know but i had no no bother so well i wasn't there all that long it only a matter a week before going off to westfield college am i suppose you see if one of us at africom as well there were three elderly marines that manned the switchboard while two were elderly i suppose too old to go to the front for instance but bernard wasn't that old but he i think he might have been wounded and sometimes they were sent to h p l o two because it was easy work and not at the front you know and it was one day one of them was ill and they wanted to break so as to well i can work one of those cause it was only a very small on and so i got on it and that was one of the reasons i think they sent me to barogerney before going to learn the whole am from the very smallest to the largest switch port and at hampstead after we had the course the last day we went to the admiralty well when i got in there all these rows of things you know and i thought how on earth can i get up there there was a kind of a foot dress and you were on a fairly high stool but i go a custom to plug up at the top you know and if you cut anybody off well that would be the end of you you know but i managed but oh that was massive and how that was a sort of last little bit of our training we went to the emeraldy yes of horse scouts parade you know it was then covered in ivy i remember but i passed out in two weeks instead of three but i think that because i had a a bit of knowledge anyway on the smaller ones so something just just describe the sea and learn the various ones you worked on am now in hampston when i got there that was the first posting after i went westfield college and we had always two maybe three on duty there you know two or three erection and when the light comes out you obviously plug in and if you're quick or if you're only doing your partner you don't know the next person will pick that up and then you have to test or will test and you can tell by the crackle if you just test it if there's crackling on the line you know it's engaged as if you over plug some of them some of them you can over plug and they won't be cut off but others you it depends on the machine you know i don't think they do these things nowadays anyway but i think i could still work them and certain you are basically that this is primitive telephones oh well yes it would be now or definitely but who were you passing through the where were you were well you got everywhere you see for instance i've been on watch when i am there might be a call coming through that everything is pulled out because it's urgent and they get their special treatment right through very urgent things that is secret they just say scramble and if you listened in you wouldn't hear the men you wouldn't understand because it just crumbled you know so you always knew there was something going on of this anything like that you know happening there 'd be something that i wasn't supposed to be generally known how did they crowell we didn't do that they did it from their ends you see and it would only be the sort of head person said jad the captain or whoever he was of the ship because they always call them ships anyway though the word land base that rolled the ships at em as this and at him as that you know
