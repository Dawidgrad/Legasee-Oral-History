so tell me we just touched on that but we didn't discuss actually just tell me a bit about your job on the oerlikon and the setup and what you were trying to do and how it operated well as i say we had this oerlikon we were responsible for the maintenance of it so it's a case of having to strip it down and make sure it worked properly then if called upon remembering the range was about a thousand yards but it was only times that you came into close contact with anything that you were required obviously you were expected to fight off any aircraft that came within that range when they came sweeping in but also if you closed on any shipping or land installations where you were required to open fire that would be part of the job was it an enjoyable job i enjoyed it yes i did i did yes indeed did you ever shoot any aircraft not actually no mainly funnily enough as far as the aircrafts concerned because of the way we were operating the bigger guns were more or less keeping them out of range so that i did get charged on one occasion why didn't i open fire my answer was that i couldn't afford to waste ammunition and this was accepted you see if the things five thousand yards away or something of that sort your shells would be falling short way before effective range you know one of the convoys that you did was quite well known j w fifty four b and er this one in company with the duke of york jamaica the destroyers savage scorpion and the norwegian stord we left iceland late on christmas eve and sailed all day christmas day and boxing day and again pretty erratic seas and then caught up with the german battlecruiser scharnhorst about four thirty in the afternoon boxing day and then all the big ships duke of york and jamaica opened fire but the scharnhorst although hit several times still managed to get away and was her speed was too fast for these other ships so four destroyers were detailed to give chase together with savage on the north side and the scorpion and stord on the south side we approached to torpedo range and we fired our torpedo and in heeling over to fire our torpedo we were hit we were struck by an eleven inch shell in the director and range finder and though it didn't explode it still killed one officer and ten ratings and seriously wounded ten ratings another shell put the starboard engine out of action so we had to retire from the fight as it were and then in company with scorpion we sailed into a kola inlet where we stayed for a week and carried out temporary repairs
