what did you think of the argentinian prisoners can remember they looked very dishevelled and the equipment was poor and aton just felt sorry for them i did missal cause i do silly question but i mean were you feeling back or weary at this point was it when we were was your head at this or this time now you've sort of experience that the intensity of what you've been through and then you're just doing other bits physically tired but you couldn't couldn't really sleep at all really just just highly alert i suppose and could put it anywhere em so am so so we did what we did was after as well we did eight hour shifts in fitzroy want for any more cast he's coming in so am so we did at out eight on eight off than that but if so try to get some sleep in that part as well as well as eating and everything else as well and stuff so what tell me about some of the higher than here the better moments way any good moments going on now after galahad em well i learnt to play a crib never played it since bolt whip button to try to let us do activities and whether we did we had did crib matches and stuff like that i was down there sir em tricep was occupied and we ever keep our minds off things i suppose m didn't get didn't get deeper forever such anywhere on things em and can you remember i mean can remember what happened at the end the mended the the pa struck trade see more remember well well i was an advance party on the uganda so tell me about moving the gander well we went home we were flown from fitzroy to stanley on a m on the single chinook we had left after the atlantic on vinod sally went down on and we were taken to the king edward hospital the them in hospital and that and we were hanging round there i think and we think we got fed and wherever cause we were real waiting to do them to get on a c t from stanley harbor to uganda and em sort of what happened was we had to so we we got on the e c t and it was full of bug argentine in prisoners of war these were well in er engineers to try to find these mine fields that they planted and that but at this time there would be ten to the er the saint edmond which i think was the prisoner warship they were using so they were dropped off before we went on to uganda and anyway the water was going going to wait up and down and we and we had to wait till we could jump across to this to this little hatch on the uganda to get on board and that so that was a bit of a scary experience she had to wait till the till the e c t roars up parallel to this hatch to the time of year and and to think you had you kit with you as well on top of it i wonder to a purpose of the uganda what you do what were you inspect him to do though what was your brief did you have a breath well it was sparsely the the main hospital ship the uganda out it was known as nosh a naval oceangoing a surgical hospital and the the female nurses seem to have an interest in us soldiers had been in combat because they had these marines on there a marine band who were i think they would class themselves as the unsung heroes and a bunch of whingers and whatever and these nurses had had had enough of them bears i think and so so they were glad to see us you see a bit of our company and worries and that so that was quite nice and then there was good food on board cast his proper food on on a lidar then how we tell about the configuration of the the operating theatres and how it had been how it had been configured in and turn into as well originally it was a school house it did school trips a uganda so we lived in dormitories and that a bit like what the galahad was dormitory run with bunk beds and that and am so am that em there was i did didn't really see the theatre as such anyway i think that there was areas where a sort of a sort of games areas which summered into theater managed to make into theaters big big dance floors or whatever as well they're made into theatres and and that to operate and so am and he had a theatre on board because they had some some soldiers had some beastly quite some er there was a magician who was who was a girker officer who did some magic and whatever and someone playing music guitar and all it so they had some entertain on board but we would do we were still running round the ship backwards and forwards round the ship umpteen times doing exercises and all this lot just keeping us fit and whatever not the not for us to were sort of fester as board and how we all that was a well term that was for about two weeks altogether on the uganda but not really not really acting as a media just sort of waiting to do see what your next brief might be no there's wallis we are ye apart from a more less fitness it was more less relaxing really yeah and how were you how is your mental state at this point were you did you have any sense that you'd been to this tome or you just living as a soldier day to day and not really thinking about it why was he 's living as as dear to day as a soldier really or not i didn't think i had any problems even if i'd got into fights and everything else i suppose after after the falklands are got into a lot of trouble and you are as well said what's there even to even in even in the falklands who start to get a bit aggressive a wife i think i might have had that aggressiveness anywhere i mean i'd been them i used to is used i was in fighting in fights at school and weather lads used to pick on me so i'll finish it off and so as i wasn't looking out for trouble in that trouble sometimes came to me and that so but the the problem is though i did think i had a problem at all even though years later it came to her pinch me on the bumbling with poor strap ex stress disorder which sometimes doesn't just lingers for years until it can something happens and i can just open up am i think that that's what happened on the p i went on a pilgrimage in two thousand and two and i thought was going to get rid of all skeltons and wever but it not opened up all wounds and then the following year was in combat stress and then went out from there up to up to now well probably up to last year i'm still on their books but busy the discharge me at the moment cause i've got myself a job that am i do some charity work in things as well so
