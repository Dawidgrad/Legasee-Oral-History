it must have been a welcome respite after the outset certainly warm yes indeed heeded it was different but then well it was a completely different set up as i say altogether we got them involved in a few skirmishes in the andaman seas a couple of those one of them a ship of japanese ship was sunk under we picked up five women survivors about five japanese and about fifty to fifty plus chose to swim away trust allows with the sharks rather than be picked up and they were so fanatic that on another occasion we sank a submarine chaser and as that ship was going down stern first the master was climbing the the mast with an automatic gun firing aimlessly into the sky of course he just went down with it the ship these were the sorts of things that you heard when the japanese had just couldn't tell what was going to happen next cat can you just describe the rescue process for somebody doesn't know how it woofers as is unusual in the arty he wouldn't really do it with you no no no no so what what was the well day just had a scrambling net over the side and they had to climb the scrambling net and you'd lifted when they got up you lift them over the top what was he like to suddenly see japanese women climbing over but the thing they were not japanese actually a indonesian one was an indian but they were more out of the island rather than the rather than japanese they were obviously for the comfort of the of the japanese so they were basing slaves said slaves absolutely and what you do with with prisoners of war me what he next dig it out the ladies of course we have put them to good use cause we had several days before we got back into port and they did all our dobying for us which was very helpful wonder what you get say yes the the japanese cars we had a constant guard over them all the time but they the five that we had just accepted that they were prisoners and that was it on one of the other boats on a one of the japanese actually committed suicide we learned but again as he just couldn't say what what was going to happen next the next thing that we are how do i describe the sea but we didn't come off best explaining again our captain was intent on becoming an admiral therefore he was looking over a all time seeking things so he pulled into stuart sound in the neck of our islands and a three or we were accompanied by a rapid agius rapid and nagimus volage we left rapid at the mouth of the sound wallace came halfway and somers went all the way up a winding stream as it were a river until we came to this island we were looking for shipping there was none there instead there was a six inch gun on this island where we came to it and passing it they could see the japanese being awakened from there siesta running to man the gun but they couldn't get a range on us so we we were lucky in that way otherwise have been blown out of a out of it altogether how far away we were fifty hundred yards and it was that that that close adversaries like a a winding river i suppose a type of thing the opting sea anyway we i received the message that the rapid had been hit so we turned back and retreated the back down the sound and he took the rapid in tow a sight that he was rather frightening she'd been hit the a erlickand crew were like wax dolls at their gun ovasly killed by the blast there was only one survivor on the pom pom deck gun had a direct hit and there were limbs legs and arms on on the deck i say it all a even scary to look at i think they lost thirty six in all and there we took her in to for ours mean time was a also put pulled back from half way and i was making smoke to protect us and we pulled out into the air into the main andaman sea and rapid was then able to make her own way under her own steam and we accompanied her to a akiab in burma where i see transfer only in wounded and the dead and that to hospitals what have you there again we didn't have time to think about these things i say dixie till we sailing again and this is now to a rangoon the capital of burma which we were retaking we were only there for four or five days because the troops ashore had made such progress that he was not much for the navy to do so we pulled back and returned to a trinka male
