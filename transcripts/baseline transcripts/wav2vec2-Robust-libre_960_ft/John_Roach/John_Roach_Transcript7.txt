how was the ship with somebody like an admiral on board i mean what was discipline like what was it i hear about it sometimes that ships are the at sars is a much more relaxed environment that way i tell her it with an admiral you've got to bring well of course you you were the senior ship there you know if you are the admiral on boards you know but we had a very good combination we had admiral somerville and we had a captain called we mcgregor and he became an admiral afterwards you know and they got on really well together we as to call him we mack and and and and and him and some of i'll get on fine and a but some of all walk round the ship and eat chat you know chatty of he's going past normally wouldn't you'd only say good morning with a non nose but you'd see him you know but he was pretty good guy if he were in gibraltar he'd be he might be out in his dingy in the morning he'd be would with his sport skate on he be pulling a dingy round a harbor of a bit of exercise or something you know to you he was a good egg if you like and some moves a very popular admire did you see that james some yes but i spoke to him but i didn't speak to me he spoke to me ha ha ha ha ha unless he was doing an inspection or something then inspecting divisions or something like that he might single somebody out and have a few words with him it sounds up to this point of the renal has been quite a lucky ship but we thought she was a very lucky ship yeah and there and the only the only will we we got hit a couple of times of norway with the nisnong and chanos in nineteen forty when we were a firm of narvic when they were trying to land when they did land up there you know so we were in action with those two and the glow worm she was with us and then she she went away to investigate some and and she was sunk so we we engage these two but again it was horrendous seize and bad visibility and and and they managed to escape but we we done a bit of damage to both especially to the nisnow i think we we damaged her quite a bit but we had two or three lemon shells came on board our ship you know but other than that i the only other diamonds we we had really was where we we were in action with a crowd l a lot of aircraft came to attack us on on a one malta convoy and we had these four four point five guns we are twenty of those and there were three turrets for three twin turrets on each side forward and two twin turrets aft and and and during the course these low flying torpedo cain aircraft came in and our guns we were very lowly very depressed very low to fire at these ones skimming over the water and the one of our guns fired into the gun next door to it in entered the turret and killed about ten peep ten of our own people and so we we we had to go in and pick all the bodies off and i was clinging on the parts of the gun and he and sew them up and in her in mail bags and and bury them at sea off of gibraltar so we lost about i think about eight or ten men there then men and boys i think as well so the main damage that we done to ourselves and how did the fat moral everybody was a bit sad because he was even people's mesnmessmates and the and and and people we knew them very well you know be all the lads that you knew one minute they be firing a gun the next when they were all dead so it was very sad occasion really well you one of the part you had to help clear up i was in the vicinity a cause i was looking after the ten up in the in that turret area i wasn't in the coal if i been in a turret i could have been killed as well as was you know but i i was in and out of these of of these gun gun turrets you know so we saw everything that was happening you know so you know everybody had to muck in i suppose and all that gun was out of action then of course you know i couldn't use it any m did you did you get any of these when you were under a sap you ever recall hitting any of the planes oh i think so of course i think we probably claim more than we condemn everybody claimed a bit more than i did but then if there was about ten ships and were all fire in us but it was difficult to know who was hit and how and may be so now and again a plane dive into the water to give three cheers or some and say well we done that when somebody else in another ship might say no it was ours or some and were you ever aware of what you were escorting you know these ships that you are taking in did you know what you were what they were carrying and was there any knowledge of it well with with the some of them all in the motor runs we knew because we were escorting aircraft carrier aircraft carriers one m was the u s s wasp and another was the argus we were carrying aeroplanes to spitfires to malta and hoping to get him within a strike and distant for malton they could take off and fly up and and help help out the you know the maltese odette air force in malta so a lot of it was reinforcing a reinforcing the air defenses of malta but we loading spitfires up in greek and take em to malta and i but also we see big merchant ships mean you may see tanks on the deck or something like that in gun but you wouldn't know what they were all carrying really you wouldn't be really interested you knew that you know it was a ship bound for malta so what the ship was carrying wouldn't make a lot of difference to us really so long as we our main job was to get it there still must have been impressive seeing all the spitfires taken off of the deck of the oh yes yes yes and there are they made a bit of a mix up a couple of times because they you know they weren't they a couple found run out of fuel never made it and and and and the lot weren't fully prepared and they they landed in malta and and they were destroyed in a few days and they weren't ready for operation when they got there so it was nice to see them all going off but then another thing was you know her and that they'd all landed safely let know that you had reinforced walter up to a point you know well it did work it did work so i timeout operation torch what it was what was really i'm doing on why we were we were standing off really because there were so many ships there coming in you know the you know the big american fleet of ships really landing troops and everything so we were more or less off the coast a given support you know to again any italian ships or any rate the german ships may may have come to interfere with the landing and a nineteen forty two at ing was linda operation torch year and it was just about the time when when they'd they started to to to move from all animal at the other end you know so so thing was always we thought well they land in north africa at least we get in somewhere you know so there were a lot of ships involved a lot of ships so you were just part of a big team i suppose he escorts and all these ships are so many landing craft and oh and various other types of ships with stores and things like that you know but we involved in firing on were fires the landed so i don't think we did for a friend i can't remember now for for a torch i don't think we did only we done any bombardment there for for torch we done bombardment and other places return not not not for torture hunting but we were there was that the biggest fleet you'd ever see at the time as a young person i suppose it was you know in in war time really that they be the biggest amount of ships in one place at one time because there were two or three different lots of them you know they'd be the add advance party and the mid the mid party and then the final party as we all various types of ships were coming in and and landing and then once they secured a couple of ports or some they were able to go in and and unload
