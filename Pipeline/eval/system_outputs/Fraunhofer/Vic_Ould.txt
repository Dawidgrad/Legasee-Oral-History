draught show we had to go for some reason to have a medical everybody had to pass for a medical lives on that drawer where it was what it was for i never told you never tell her into a nightmare is now reduced to silence service you never told him the so i went through this medical examination as it came to my turn to gina medical officer you set out i won out i stand out among side wait for

sheep obviously to rendered monopolies ownership to compose a on so few wage tan so well known but on another draft on this was right you miss karen and were not tall red just hum told me i don't know draught and you have a number of overdraft so when the time came there was a bell one hundred and fifty to two hundred of us i'm from chatham were put on a no heavy trucks are back trying to pull over back open back the cupboard truck taken down to the london station on notion which one it was now but all of us put on one trine and on the nose or any other cause any other people now try and everyone into the door to locked we were locked in i'm young lad was hard to me said now and as for jude yes suppose good enough knowledge now stopped to go again to which when we get your stallion i started to chat real friendly none of us ever near each other for you come from all over the place only my that was a long trip up to gladden glasgow we stopped quite a few times and nothing for air rage and for no reason i believe we stopped at carlisle undone the windows were opened of the carriages lovely cups of tea and sandwiches passed across from the w vs or who will forever now i knew i often low rest on started to try it again as we drew out the station i remembered there was big factory by the side of the station right on the track hold on all male or something of that and out of his bow windows those balloons undergoes wave in the blurred and we're not some nibbler indulge him remember or they were a little bitch of another type rejoined mention on the right of that knowledge we loved that the fact of rebellion yeah cheered on a wide revenged my arrived at younger let's go i'm trying to change straightaway over to what must have been a low he'll drown that trained took her to greenock on greenhouse who was our destination and we were then put it in two and they must have been the y m c i a big bear warden and we were then told the we were due to have beat shift commonly of a brand new ship has been built in shipyard witches write letters daughters wives ivory why am i i really now it wasn't ready um we could go and look over the ship any time we liked a mesh of warriors and um people welding and uh cornell cover to remember what we did remove from the mold route greenock anyway in a few weeks the ship was ready audi all was and best impatient had been removed and are you wash given their places on only a foreign mystic huh pointed out where we had our locker where report a new clothes we were in uniform now of course all their civilian clothes had gone so you just said oh neither for clothes the first of things you had to do go for uh a trial on the charge of taken of the clyde your to do their speed whatever determined and uh a few gunnery talk o trial anyway when when we finished the trials and the ship that commission then into the royal navy that was your time we was gonna be all none of us were david was told that we regard i've also and die so if we happen to be havin sure leave we can tell anybody but then one dark night shortly after we finished our triumphs reach slipped from the dog dockside the um or of the the yard yard and on edge doorway up through the clyde no lights of course the closed order watertight doors or scuttled would a deadline and we were given our positions that we were on watch then were real sailors and so on i was starboard walsh show therefore i would be up only a half an hour from the shore but what lookout we never had any actual training for this it breeds just retold to do whatever retold underwriter we aged out into collide you have to go past the boom rich lecture out the tide cried and i remember i came off watch or hadn't gone on more charcoal remember this died but ordered reasons to go to the hedge which all the toilets odd shut down just shut him down as i enormous explosion the hang on those rattled pull the trout it up quickly rushed out of the the door into the on what i could die and county and flat there's just too i'm passageway and bumped into her um one of the other side losers officer little porch birds but as if we've been told reader and effort now out now eternities torpedo than trying to deck george is out but shame faced i didn't go well here's the roulette flies decker anyway so we had to go to laugh about that anybody from their society a dark and the light why why was it all and so time this time when you left of that she ditches one for the problem that the enemy on you that your ship being built nearly all the time and they would come out of the clyde or come out of the time or perhaps come out of them a oil and and if you for you couldn't visualize ireland and scotland and there's a narrows is fairly wide the dodger long distant pay narrows as as a continent and therefore ship's have to come in and out of the era all this should always the places where you'd have two or three euros just lurking hoping for a good kill and whether they were ever found out that a ship for manish boys are under there was coming out of that time of no idea but that was the most dangerous popular but none of us had worked together read all come out of trying you bet had good training and our own jobs but a cool thoughts attain because we were not ready to say if it were a trainee red show from there on bridge right fred hebrides it was really the put the few scholars the experience on the officers of kosher worries for those you shut the had to have all their knowledge to do what you were doing gras you'd get no i'm esco your ship complaint girl near one with seventy five percent of the crew that had never been deceived before never even seen a ship before very often sure if if we'd been attacked at that time in river had been a certain doc when we arrived at scapa flow ridges relatively shy life we go through the boom again to get into the flow from then on the to do at trianon they're trying to end at scapa flow really is to get you working as a team the whole ship has to know reject your did earn a going crew a little for five i should know how to work together of your in the uh transmitting station which is the one and the nurse and his light we were as gunnery control you'd have um about ten people in that room are shown in charge of an ordinary unscheduled room and on each one of those has a job to do because a on a destroyer which we were as much car which destroyed a brand new wonder as well so nobody knew anything about it shall we have to learn how to use the for control table as it was for your people on it and all those april loaded trained on something shimmering is right and i still have to know how to fight and the ship to tact or wish had taken up a shirt so that was what what was expected of us in the flower but that time we were so sure to have destroyers in particular and other escort trips show not only were wish diane and annoy safe area to do our training when you were sent out well in harness as it was cold or the another ship the more by more experience but the nokia quarters only one of your ditches experience and one which is shrine enriches us sorry when we learned that the hard way are all our real fighting was around that time at the end of nineteen forty four which was a october november december uh why's around the aerial showed they'd send us out and another ship and this is among coach why where the one ships to reduce the flow destroyers and where you were called drew to destroy a native fish bullen but we didn't know about that time of was a ship that your son so where you've ashamed how ah we know not known basic trainer and this we'd had a coal to go to a ship off cape wrath the had been shrunk we didn't know who had been torpedo that electing a message was not there had been sunk the ship had been torpedoed and true destroyed had to go out to join help to catch the you vote that sancho and to pick up survivors if there were any there though there is true of us and it seemed um from other records are locked up gave a ship that went up well with us was another ship that is also working now so this true destroyers with absolutely no rich puritans at all am i to go out to the ship found dale later in life it was a commission bullen which was a a school visual nod been looking for you bow the very u boat had been looking for hit one of our ships first so i'd miss morland and had been sunk and uh the other ships that were whither were still looking for the you the u boat well the first thing we did was done ask if i was very knowledgeable very experienced and he went to the petition whether you but where the u boat had shrunk ache miss thriller as she was bullen nobody's told anything he knew it h miserable and none of us were told so the first thing you do you go round departure that charge in the whole of the area and coached u very still there where we picked up an echo switch told me as to go operetta thought there was something down there rich could be the u boat so i read depth charge that area and apparently the echo wriggle didn't move and stayed there shall we find but that was a yugo and um never never came up never got near oil they've got into their shall we at that time in the war the snow covered only just started so which helped them i told him the more now this your bow for did he come up within twelve wells then there was a dead dog charm we waited around there oh no it with a boarding party ready to go on to do bo could it would have had to come up where and men and then ashamed ray had to go and another job donor whether he received the message or but we had to go on an escort girl should be stood down the whole team always looking out there's intellectual where they stood town the a team of the boarding party an odd looking over the sides as ship i had no work to do a lot of watch darker shade in near distance like the more and float past but nobody shot at it rich my ma and unusually just in case there is a new boat down over now that we were still there we were on shore charlotte routine all night you never started your engines for she did not that you bought if he was still alive them down there to know that reversal up there waiting to ride in the end we and went back to the cup of flour and carried over there learning to fall at war tell me about christmas and scatter well the dish was a there's the automotive outwards the shrieks of december all them the two more drugs we might have done their on no shore but the next important have the archer remember is where are you i'm not required for work round the christmas period showed were back in scapa flow and it was quiet and we were shy if but none of us that had at christmas away from home before this and there we all were the dead plays scarecrow shabbos terrible place better than them and what's surprised me was is two hundred ownership provocateur under chips compliment and luckily we have a few amongst us so we're rich variants on there we were the cook to the mess when making christmas cake shrivel ever stuff we could get hold of rose i managed to get i'm not sure where from the christian retreated for somewhere and that a run up on the top of the mast on the top of every ship her christmas time of their own hall but have a christmas tree or she'd run up on the top of the ship undone we should have been shoved or think by the officers but in christmas but a car remembered with or you were not and you're not allowed to have drink on board it a drawer ship but somebody old stages had saved some of their rum ration which are not allowed to do the rushes very bad very high charge if you are cold but the officers normally on us on a small ship like a destroyer close your oars to locked to things that there won't be allowed to of thy run a picture that befall a passel ship so many of the ledge that were allowed rum i wasn't there you're not loud run to your twenty knows one eighteen but i'll come from russian horrible haiti on undone people made up these or paper martha and a patched him pay for red green and blue came from different places out of horrid holes and made into decorations and we were more to avoid their of the time and machine christmas souls on prince on the people had instruments are real a small ban on board on of someone upheaval or suppose that quiet summer alert you come from homes are never and if tired although very tearful form i came from a oh ho lurch we didn't have much mantle sir christmas would move much different from the tiny my year will endure their first christmas away from home and anna please tell us a flow of talk with and the commander brokers and was a captain and everybody would have given a life for him really i after him riven for time cuarto de rivers very strict i'm happy to turn his life he was it was a lad to simon's us i'm late on in the story we're i'm gonna fail are used um i'll tell you a little bit more about it but he we had motor polo teams and he was on the team with the ledge against the officers and hit that was the type of first day would be under heavers author boxing champion of a of the fly or pour the fleet under yet even such a nourish busan yellow and there is another case or tired too late war when all go ashore so um but the next shame we we went on rarely after christmas after christmas was when were you really started and learned that there was a war on we would still go out of which to go out as a ship workin up together but the first one mercury went out with operative to aircraft carriers a nursery to be a strike against norway we didn't know tower you're a shady the river during this but there was used to aircraft carriers some more destroyers thing and um shoving the other ships now out our job was not ready to protect the one of the carriers but it was all show to act um but a lifeboat really what when the um aircraft took off another and cut the days were rolled tripe air craft i can't remember the name of a but they rebel planes now their shoes are really rough dial and they took off all i watched him over to know much older time and all wash and from the deck and the carriers balance and up and down they took off and i'll think i carried out or try to carry out their task but the true or she'll come back didn't make it the ship was dull and shut up and down they'll call carrier dancing i'm down i'm not believe one of them hit the deck and was pushed out of old as with the people in it i can't take him out for some one to make way for another one landen and the other one disappeared i think he would have no orders to try and fly back train or a base because you're too rough to land on the aircraft carrier we are on your being crushed by a cold where you went to try and find the aircraft are ditched sadly no aircraft shire anyway i'll think they had to cool off the strike could have just to to diane rush to do any more flying or in her all that showed that was really a obeyed beginning two long war are we went back to scarper yet you took about it being rough how your sea legs terrible or seasick most times i went to see but when you when you one when you on lookout or when you're in the tss riches in calm this yes is down below and that he's the transmitting station that type c the sulaco relay from the director tower which is right off the top of the ship flew you in her yes to the main armament produced for foreign her gum so i'm always to communication on wilshire the director would speak to me the after two of his vision of your director by speaking to me and i would be speaking to the guns but paul from that um the director would i dinged undershirt word i'm shutting signaled down to our big computer the original um mechanical computer and a mechanical computer rich and that information mechanically to the guns but one shall got in two a position where there is excitement forgot all about sea sickness oh okay so that the good though the normally if i wasn't on ball march or sand on a beach sand or knew of headache fortune to see he even up and down and probably been sick the only time you go to action stations is when your expectation action thriller um a large romanov or talk about the main land we were action stations all the time but if you're doing a job just escort and then your cruisin stations and until some trouble pop shop um depth jordan you vouch is not occasion going to action stations the show near if the u boat fight back then yknow to action stations so anyway and we went from their back to scapa flow um i think we did one altered her unusual at this um off the coast of norway and this is the beginning of nineteen forty five and eventually we are supposedly finished our tribune of working together as a team my dawlish time i'm a total talking your they'll know we're sure learnin because we were so so teaming up with people that we never worked her before sure of red run into any real trouble at that time we were understood a lot of chance it wasn't a large one memory and learnt these though so um the next one authors come is an important a long this is it about february or blue we were just told we were going to else then that night were you not giving any real and note about where we have a guy and will walk you were going to do but it was a very big do there was a very large for sure we left about ten o'clock of neil believe is this our first scarper digit out a scalper this is a this evil turned out through the main line and operation um it there was a very there is a very although there was no moon is all starlight shortly very good visibility and if in a very calm night strangely enough hardly any rough sea or another we shut out the watch you should know who's whither you it's a silent service you're not toward any though we've been about helped about an hour or believe belt ten o'clock and the skipper then said over tannoy what we was going to do it opened his orders you told us where yacht river a big fault one of the large force were going down the show the show them part of norway too eager sand and they were going to attack a convoy we were just one of true ship the other one was azaleas saves all the same to shores where you were and our main task where he was reared to restful there's some manuel a special polo first of all both forces working together had to pass through a big minefield or there's a big line for all that load of they by us and um we had to go from one path for it was really only pull through but renew radio was so it should have been safe enough they do get loose mullins so are as thick operators had to um pick out the loans to buy and always on march at one time nor good here so here in beside um that there's somebody on the port side and the captain would move the ship overbear your anyway why got through the minefield all of us were no real problem and um then we split up we were to wait joe twelve o'clock and at that time at twelve o'clock the other big force where we were bought away up there stavanger at that point and the other big folks were true cruisers will think and another aircraft carriers at that point and they were going to attack a conroy the german combed whatever's gonna leave eager sand but going to hug the coach all the way up to stir stavanger where we were but we were the other philosophers to stop him get in there shall i read your dead on travel clock the the other force we're going to attack the convoy a narrow hopin in that case when that started to be locked the fireworks down foot alarmed mccarty cos you're under more whores but that would take the heat off what we were don't we were a kinder stein operation the wave retire escort the apollo to the point where your shivered gonna start laying mines debt on twelve o'clock unwavering to be between her in a norwegian coast and if she was shouted on border germans hum or picked up all right over the germans a neighbor to saw far in where you were to make as much noise as record and tear up and down the bit of shade between us and between the apollo and the norwegian coast and you'd all the guns and flares and everything we could to take the heat of her shuddered attack us um show the apollo hung on the flushed us or indicated to us or not or no shore the grit your give everybody had to keep right to do so i lent and we were on sheila routine nobody's allowed to smoke show and they were not even allowed to the bone because the noise um we were not far away from the coast alter and i'm in but the trip by vassal near their escort destroyed his alias had to keep up as much steam as we could because if the forward shotted reared to have the a four speed rush up and down this bit of courage for in whatever we could prevent them to to their paulo well i could hear from the guns because in the tears i'm from new director um before we started during anything nor cadet paper that gun sign when we shoot ahead large say they're just just over their little bit recall coming down going from the right to the left nor coderre wallace side of the coin so yards from where they are and then you should write of started down the other end and i started far and done at the upper end they attacked his convoy and um they drew said other why couldn't i can change anyway cause all turned in the tss basket and order messages from a not two officers up in the uh uh director tower but from more might on a yawn begun actually on the war gun by your finally the information in the most i don't think that there's smoke it over and i'm on that oh i really come and see us and you're like apparently they didn't read enough to do much but shall we were slowly crude it up and down and the um apollo started lay on our minds that on time that on twelve o'clock are the the main lawyer to beg my liar carried a lot mourned by cruiser thei r and one so short loan them on the phone number of where we what about how then they can't stop they've got to do the whole of the main lane because the main floor then laid show they can turn back i can only go on and carry on lay in her mind to a nearby we're just going ashore enough and down and because how shepherds keeping steam up ready for our quick dash up and down the veil of blue so you got a noble is a well known destroyer who'd route route route which we do every time you come in and out of hava just to signal and apparently everybody went mad to cruises thank mad their den charlotte routine yeah undone the fact that we were never such they'll not to the very end i know i think it may even they if anybody had heard that were ripe which is a well known purchased destroyer signal decide a yell and coming into harbour which i'm ready of that thought now can be a british destroy don't be daft enough to fill ethereal at that you know cell anyway i'm delayed a light them orange and then we knew i don't know about chicken or walk she shed all done hello were carried out ambition she began pole and all is at that time listening to some of the a minor and they retired look at our move and she returned fourteen knots she won a faster ships or were and they could she the bell wave knowledge is not but some it was starlight and you could see you could see the shore you could see the place where the guns were where i would have had a cracker alas there alone i'm done away went the apollo and i'm speed and then we turned round but why we went as far as we could but we were not allowed to go at a good speed because you've got a second old the germans let's just out that there are intact special from eager sand with the bat round on down now and some friends of mine after age on their paulo we're going to touch them thy shed thy understood and they renew and too modest a telegrapher offers they understood that weird been challenged although for chauvin challenge could had picked us up all right off the horse had been challenged and he thinks but the neon apollo who was in charge of course and given the right challenge answer but then they talents again later on and didn't cut their porridge started disappearing shudder shown torpedo bombers after us undone they never found us sorry got back hotel simon made his successful have forced down none further egg ingress and egress and and stopped the convoy going up to jump at the german convoy they've done shrunk one or two of the ships and one or two of our ships as as injured people but john let's hold mission was successful for a sounds to me like you were expendable when you are at home with the upon you are why is it i would as soon destroy was a valuable bidding kit took a bit about the role of destroyer and and he's come parables yet begun to ottawa worship were i shall remain is because later on um where it went towards the end of the war whose rugby enough one his memory were a big fought escort in a summer the crews are out to the far reached we only took a mouthful of gibraltar you say then another force takes over but we were a scolding about worship the renown and why would the closure school wonder straw each shied further close where's others preferred route and it's a beautiful day like this and all was no more justly near i've inside but we were quite close because it close escort you say i'm just leaning over the side and over the tunnel i come to work from the captain where no one will reach in a dangerous area and there lie by you vote around if a u boat as fond of torpedo and that is um pick young overhead the where we choose to track of that torpedo heading toward big sister rich i could renown then we stop it you know what we mean when you stop it and as made looking over the side look at the torpedo bulge on the renown content yourself yes you're gonna lose two hundred men just as topo torpedo bend and at all torpedo bobo juno you know just sounded a bit about the role of a destroyer well roll romola thou know'st destroyers is there fast and the maneuverable and they're like a smaller version of a crucial they have order gallery but smoulder guns showed their god for big guns for one five begun and other smaller guns undergo those the one thing they've got extra i'm above the smaller sideboard chicago down uh the big ships have not got anti submarine equipment they've got to appear to us than those by an assault sub bridge on the surface there got no depth charges so um the destroyer hush depth charges so we were there too but on the other hand the difference of derision boy you've got the destroyer as well is just as i said if the capital ship or whatever is your garden is torpedoes the loss result is you get on in while the torpedo the draw the luge a ship to sony got two hundred two hundred mental mold than the possibility of illusion morton tour under men on the battleship remote as it might be if he's got a torpedo bulge on this horrible over shore tool of shore of the shores there are so many of them get get lost because the first thing you do wherein our torpedo is cited he has to go to attack the submarine the florida but you should be near enough to get in the way of the torpedo if he happens to be heading your wife you know when you talked a bit about how you were to team you a very young crew for a moment when you were on board where you thought we work in brilliant in an hum both know roughly you just sure fit in um part of life is you you you managed to fit into every situation if you're lucky enough undone hi hotel never borrowed on who's there because you are a good swimmer but you must bear why even if the ship change but then were you when you think about it and you speak rather people are you rot schieber shall not the time yeah that is a belt which young should shave you rich you where all the time that she but you can't wait at belt blown up vigor to get in the way of young to never though shall what happens is a few have to jump into the organist i call it the sea that belt mustn't be blown up because it my break your arms shall your expected to blow that up when you hit the sea and then i called chez got lucky on their return but or however survivors of tommy yes i'd to blow up assumes i hit the water now had no breath at all left uncle blowing up but the sabres dragged your dale because stood this report your errand this it's just one of those thing what's the next big event that you recall them um but it was really mundane rehearsed the thing even even um as a school to the monsters who did a little the your enemies in most cases where society we got battered left right and centre trying to keep up with the crematory and the queen elizabeth's because as we took them out of the claude reject jagged rolled away rhythm and we kept up with him till they reached the top swayed for its young was the distant about further the wire cross on them reluctant henri either waited around for that one coming in for instance remodeled tinder cry mary out and we had to wait just a few hours from the queen elizabeth techs had come in done order time one of you might pick up one of the thrill you of the queen mary would have his own asdic besides his own right on and why of course you wrote the asdic and rode off on our kohl proved a cavalier would be decided well when rich dave now we would probably be appall of the extremes of iraqi asdic circle and you're right also call shall you didn't interfere with each others richie of the the wave and if we picked up an account which might have been a submarine moderate erect and immediately we ran up a black flag on our fled dirk so the queen mary would know i know shall you a cavalier would know that we picked up an account we made a weed hive off to attack the echo and this should where you're in trouble this is if that's what you bow the moth already fades told her though and this is where you turn off swiftly of falsehood if you can if you got beam shame owes you can turn off left or right hypno beam saying a destroy a hard at any draught gitano restored awhile so there you have to be very recovery never did but every lock hoarders by judgment order not then you like then if you haven't been here boy told her to do then you'd find your way to wear of the car was and you would attack the echoes lucius about to depth charges from one side to the other and roll off of the true rachel near toes pattern about ten charges well if the you though is a very experienced one on average watching you on the periscope he would be there when you arrived even i'd have gone down low or he would have disappeared another direction but this she kept him down there no chance of him khitan your charge and then ride after try to catch up talk about a half a day because there's there came from the same speed even if the true destroys had to leave the queen mary or the queen elizabeth the cried mary would carry on it wouldn't stop and one of the worst thing that could have happened if they'd actually torpedo the queen mary then they would have lost lot alive's because while your the queen mary but if it's coming back in he'll have a full complement of american g i's not a b between ten thousand and fifteen thousand it would be carrion now there would not be over her tighten up their water thought doors because they're going from the different deck shorter time in twenty four hours the frigo interaction stations there miko's her watertight doors which means of sure torpedo your mind there alone damaged the compartment where ill were then so the ship marginal learned shake the efforts on the queen mary the look of no child viner their watertight doors then colors because they're traveling between a definitive index the prep sleep and on monday trodden up next deck to eight ford another deck for exercise the tape deck is always anxious eyes the decline of closure grow ward fell at doors so any of those who have been made the biggest disasters who had fallen and what was it like saying the ship was the queen mary the queen elizabeth and saying when did you have any pride to winning where they ships that you knew all the more proud of anyone well um um or we read in your were the way was going to pick up on the monsters or bring one monster than aught aut if it was the queen mary and where you are in crane ok then we would now is the greater the covering where we retired out much where you got free funnel was anyone and free picked out for he's got free for noses to cry mary is not to follow judge queen elizabeth unsure and you'll former for fun over the aquitania and so it went on for you and never told you just sheila helps and then go to rendezvous where you're right around the or you already contacted that ship to show you there a new furniture in very often a even we to escort one would be a great over their card near the down that liverpool and we would reach a point of rendezvous going out the chlorate and the other one the cavalier fret come out liverpool then reached him up together to the and a rendezvous for him for the and the monster that this happened a large once or twice a week four a miraculous we never had to shining cohort um because they will always be in saying area that by doing something else i'm very trying that i'm sure drew to ship if there was an aircraft carrier which happened in one case on eventual prideaux's red just come down from scarper two two great oak oliver had just arrived at the harbour entrance we went straight to us and orla because you always have to fill up with oil because you might throw out and just as we are not the oiler we got an emergency call to show that done an aircraft carrier had been torpedoed just out in the cold at the beginning of the card shall i agree and just let go from the oiler and we went straight out to a to the the thing was a aircraft carrier and strangely enough she was on her own she would come from londonderry should have no rascal unluckily she did never fall compliment over proved shamans are evolved and she would come into the room to the clod or that a y but though to persuade her to read erred um a merchant ship at the same time a new they've got away although we went to attack it it was dark and uh we left the others are they look into the u boat afterwards where we came and back and harbour oh how long are you are safe when you're at any atlantic how often you going back to base and getting the land legs in a destroyer not very long because you have not that much fuel and yours you can you stop spy always manoeuvre on your own you i have continued for all of you out for a long time is for from one bigger ships on from an aircraft carrier or something as big as a bell fox a cruiser or something like that and also food you've heard rangel after a short while charlie one time we were really out for a long time is on one read up at scapa wear rouge um working up the lemurs going out on them for us to a to help to sinking tip tirpitz or during other jobs most of the others it was acacia of going out just for a day or two to pick up one of the monsters and then come back with the monster or take one out and leave it the rejoice ride after go to london very perhaps and then we come out londonderry again and and i'll go out on that so we're we're lucky in that respect that uh no room and not go out for a very long there's one on one occasion when are we resolved for very old time must win over the five days or call remember what the occasion was but we had run out of food and we wish further up in the north atlantic and our captain was the expeditionary fly man at his own fishery flew pen so what what he decided to do a dry run out of food and she'll know rarely fish i'm or chloe regarded the ship up to where knew they were picked up a shell fell on the right at all although the asdic dropped it upsets her heart learn the bow picked up all the fish that came up this stunned and stood on the focal retorted settle on the forecastle and so that one main brett computers one we lived on fish for a few days after that i am one burger but higher range were mostly on just about five days at a time but that meant that every time and came in to the uh either scarper or if we were in liverpool or to the clyde we had to awaits had plenty of floor on board because are you sure this ashore another duty destroyer and then if suddenly come not worships been sunk you have to be carried out straight away and you might be out for a long time looking for a submarine all one one submarine so we were lucky in the fact that a re never went out for a long time otherwise it would have been all in at sea ridges and dangerous practice anyway and pick it up food nourishing food for me can you describe raider yes this is the job you again right on yes fido into our first of all went on the right offset is on your small shirts and uh it the different types the two now and through that is high up on the loss not specially for pick it up air craft or surface ships rudy any fanny distant dark long can think of right minded ryan joel that but it sends out signal from there richard gorge if it doesn't hear anything you don't get it back but if it has anything even cliffs or orna croft or surface ship that it balances back and on the screen you have done which is a around grown under the uh the kershaw's guide round all the time that will show a blip on that blip hereafter be able to determine whether it some a cloud richard made papers depend on your way at all but a dune vertical wangler and you will then read off the distance and the angle of everything if they dishes mostly on on on a level or but you have another scream which gives you the height of an air craft shall you huge one way or the other that the a minute and chicken or electronic signal hitch anything that it returns and then you read of the distance of it but is it easy to use they did not issues you to use a way wave on a difficulty is for experience you know very well what you're looking at all the land because of the sides of it on their or it is a small blip then it is an air craft a ship for whatever if if you know your usual one top arrived off it's only a horizontal a few years in another one near commuter horizontal or an air craft and it will give you a good distance the time it types of course is based on retired ten seconds it from there to there then found a new reader often shrine luckily our point and all we never had any trouble with her across the undertone reward about pullman vedder just the torpedo bombers had been sent after us or norway then we would have had to you there and then we would know that yeah we'd after you to to radar such than the one that gives you a signal had a height on the air craft near the one which gives a distance of it and then you're you're trying to know richard to the difference and also believe that was i remember if it was one of her own air craft it would have an identification signal which you would know on your right also before it got to your shoulders you you'd have to beg pretty well experience but my time would not always honor road also you shan't on a lookout was assuming what are your shirt enough in a lookout box on the starboard side is mine and you're looking out for air craft which would not very often resort i'm sure fish ships or more than likely you're lookin out for reliable to any perish gob richard very hard to say in a rougher atlantic or you will be unlucky enough to see the track of the torpedo come into order michiko should get into a panic and call out quickly to the people on the bridge of the fever on the bridge the captain all the officer of the law of the water at a time in those days it was an open bridge nowadays is encouraged by now from bridge so the bridges here you gotta look out as you just here to just call out to that person on the bridge officer ship therein read five oh grandfather were aware of your position is angle of shy of his on air craft neared immediately and look at it and to show what action to take but if you will not look out position were told was on quite a lock as a seaman is rough because there's the ship goes down all the time a bit i'll destroy your where so shalt marina times the whole of the sea count up over you when you get knocked back against the search light and then it's very dome of that very wroth an uncomfortable though unless you want to get used to your here's the way up i'm a special suit which covered your complete a reward of her suit with capable fan and um but even even that the water but all the way down the new york soaking wet he'll remember coming off watch amanda occasional this cause normally you have to climb back down on the outside leaders at a ship because the those that you would go you in and out in port we're open when you say those doors will be closed because the water comes in those shall you have to climb down labors than outside the ship not now else i didn't see but climbed down from the top deck to the father and of not careful the wife and it hit sure you can get washed away so you're a hold on very tired well this was the middle watch the are from recall what you from twelve o'clock in the morning to fall cork in the mold tropical the law to for her in the morning but you know on watch look how all at home at a four hour watch you do different jobs are found on lookout half hour preferably road all set or fire one of our behind a region where there is a god you become part of the gun crew show if you did have to go into action you do the shooting water rule gun crew there's called up to take over from now on this occasion there have been very where else i'd got chauvelin i'm tired of sin middle watch from the veil for clark had come down to went down to my mistake richard dinner focal to rough bar the trip i hadn't shall have more hammock watch letting me ah cushions the time i thought infantry shoot shade on the cushion to the ship was guys are not just why on your table of the curtains shire i got down under the mesh table there's about that much water on the floor the deck sorry not the floor on the deck about that much fire a goal record or murdered this searchers recorded everything mom lying down now off to sleep strikes a lie next to go another a full and touch me and i owed not bleary eyes and there's the officer of the watch and the leaden shaman and a mess and the resigned to me untold dish in the morning by the leading hand of the mess i shed the officer said chou come on shame on you can sleep under there is to wear knothead and he looked at the laden hand and said what did he say and the names would melt and out i read that language and so oh well we bet low you let me shrink there molecular nothing was said about it oh in your line and that much water the the decks or the ship for inside now in charge your mistake the water just this um one temperature outside and a little bit warmer inside show you're all humidity or the water runs down the inside of the day anytime you want a cavalier you overlook then should crush your metal work as a ship saw and his only about an eighth of an inch no thicker than that and um should there thou wert you've got water most the time when never knew on a mesh tex when you're at sea and here in harbour you're not too bad that it gets a bit uncomfortable there was another time when we worked where decree neri and we had to pick her up to your room we went out on a gin well one of the roughest stones that it really about three really rough stones in the period of we work and in the atlantic and we had to at this time by about march nine forty five or had to go and pick out the queen mary now that the stall had been raised in all the way from america and it must have been one of the the these dick's shoulder had come across how why and the primary brought it with us old thing and we picked her up and uh i think we dial more waiting to pick her up because even shield and held up bought a bad storm oh we and order which was a sister ship of that time but we got really been tough were lost on a motorboat we lost to hung one of the wireless and we got really knocked him out and when we go i'm towards the clyde the crane decree mary knowing that it was in the area that there would be u boats we had to rely on our speech but for me but change your azure azure you got within hailing distance of losing sight of the other clyde and they're crazy mary to shoddy chico and slow down to keep up with us cause there's too rough for us we would have been turned over and so she does flush the message she you're in a card tete all and she kept help her speed and got into the glide now she had the whole of the front of her bridge stove in and there is a big ship and love in air that a lot of casualties because they're carrying a bell twelve thousand troops and um this was now late at night on then cavell um you remember flew a drone coca cola that only by she got into the collide with but our energy but damage from from the sea relenting later on now in the chloride you're not allowed to an anchor and we can go further than to greenwich took their greenock because after that you go through the boom and the boom is closed that nor analysis absolutely necessary to open the boom page revenge or up to prevent an you vouch kitten at that point show at the other side where we had to run toy up to a boy we'll have to four jumpers to tie up to avoid you have to stop and you have to lower your wine cellar with the four jumper and the rowers in it to take you to the boy with a trifling the clever to the boy well if i've given you a picture thou rough the storm was it was almost impossible that first while we were young and let down on to the water managed to get down safely they got washed away that occur in it further down the clyde the way for about three or four hours we managed to lower another whaler all of us was up on the forecastle real old seaman the could help was up on the forecastle and a critical use your anchor who just yours none could trying which goes where the a wall out touch to the end of the anchor trying and the the uh y la has to take this wire to the boy the collector onto the boy and then the boys poured for the anchor trying nearer a little chip shallow then click on charted by lowered the shackle whaler the boy chamber managed to get on to the boy and in during her broke his wrist and uh in the end after all there is about four hours we managed to climb up to the board and um the captain had topped all round ah i hated the smell of robin hood while and never would have a little talk because as the horrible but uh well how did that night because we were frozen frozen stiff and uh are you going to to get away with it but nothing was ever said about this type of thing because although people at the pork's nearer the big ships come come in there was not a thing that those talked about there is the germans also knew but they were bringing the old age large numbers between a ten and fifteen thousand troops there could carry and um and near the you vote captains i understand niches no knowledge were offered a large sum of money the flowers and the on the other side doors small dark small thousand dollars about on the highest of the bar of honors to have knocked down any one of the monsters but uh we never lotto unfortunately i'm a better side but though the queen mary and rarely bettered very badly battered how ridden turner room has no idea when you talking about big sees what suicides you too well if your horn the disease itself had told her that well and there is she is generally known that shaman awaits were sixty four high now a few thing of sixty four going up that way when you go up to the wine usu when you come down to the trough you're a hundred and twenty four and there's no way you can cut through those wage hum the big ships orders for ships you actually go up on it why you've on then you feel it and you know it crunch lot that and then you up to next one and order fell on your corkscrew yeah yeah yeah not still and you get used to this after an hour of hush few months because you've got roses all over the place because she go through no more uncork fletcher called on to draw the normal corridor on the floor on a flitted and to show our richard about that wide well when you first go aboard one lie there near it fairly calm and you set out for scarper from gridlock but as you walk along the deck comes up the miniature jack goes up on us it's your fate as you go down under that that before you know it that there could gone away as a ship goes down on this issue from the top and then well that's happening because your during this this bowl cottage lucia now that thou cottage or so in time he learned to walk like a sailor owners to ship go down you go down with it and come up with it that's what your fan sayers and when you get to shore they will get a roll or could roll that you just that the still walking on the ship two after the end of the war i day but you're finished yeah i'm very day itself we were as does the ninth annoying we're a brigade in the older from and where real notice that the peace son i've been declared for the next day um where are you coming integrate into gridlock slow reaction in the last of the when chip convoys before the war ended so we arrived in great or i'll believe it taught a wrench your sunday and half the ships come there is allowed leave which wasn't me off or was it one of the ships come then but they went ashore to run to gray ok you'll have a good son the torn sure then we still carried on with shamanism can wars after their because some there was quite a few of the eu botch the apparently mission a mulatto them of one or two went to a brazil or whatever showed there was a huge still a chance to if there was a rope robe you vote around and could have knocked down she comedienne monsters we were sure bring him back in but we had no problems at all but to cut a long story show anyway where you were then destined to go across to run then trod ran the japanese war sure trouble a true a flotilla went in for refit we re rend him for a refit late in me june and because we're we're going out there anyway but for to leave all of autumn leave to go out there the ship resounded on devonport they reverted the war ended shall shook off teddy ran to say they leave actor thirdly bachelor when we came back to the ship we still had to go out there because where you were having to clear up after the war well the whole affair flotilla broiled the then we were the last to charm as you run out gibraltar mortar iden pleasure that we withhold ears in a lovely so much courage but then when we got to singapore now when we got to trigger melody have turned over by this revised the tree humbly a more show based at singapore when we got to singapore um dishes just about a week or two after the war and we were carried out an exercise with the ones you must show six on another ship on the captain of the flour the flotilla leda who was on as you must shave and a ourselves in cavalier were ordered to go ride a sussex two and a problem shall we meet anybody that force feed when you are sure to uh to java we stopped on a a couple of troop ships on the wine i can't remember much about that little bit but we took on board air for a full that was covered with indian troops armed indian troops on the cavaliers as i am on the caesar was also and they shot ex anchored outside sure by occurs it comin in we could hardly get encoded those are a sunken a japanese cruiser in there in the water china's shooter went in first cause us for that allude a full of troops we went in shackles was river shy hunt and then the cavalier after it which we went in as daylight we had already tripped on board show of his that any trouble with an abuser guns creditor luckily we didn't have any trouble from utah but those who we came into sure buyer like i was looking over the side and there was bodice dozens of them in what noble uniforms why didn't they were club probably dutch i don't think i was ours but we're a slowly moving or avoided the dish wreckage and avoided the bodies and um you've got to the stove now when really in a war bodied and would make no difference to victor accepted the fact that they were born ocean did not know charlie receivers shiny moved in re anchored in the dock there and um one by one cruiser discouraged her troops first and way helen nash so the three of us or our troops when the shoal the dog had been already taken over by an hour the u k army or then have been brought in ahead undone it was the ingenue indonesian rebels though phaeton that already killed on brigadier malady that was the army hum bosch i'm a noose church went to shore and we stayed there ready for i'm a lot of chauvelin rivers hum of the dutch people they were gonna be brought across from can't brought the other side of um sure buyer and they were not gonna be pro under no school of her another church she bigoted oliver had been killed under a truce and now this supposed to be in about four thousand dutch people women and children mostly on account of the other side they're gonna be brought across by another truce um army trucks guarded by engine troops they're gonna be brutal across to us we're gonna have a more on board and we were to take them out to the troopers which convert into the harbour well why well then told while we wait for these people to come across we were to go out into the water they crush me won't be used which was which was absolutely necessary to happen when this convoy of army trunks guarded by indian troops got as far as sure bile but he found that they were stopped when i heard a white flag there was shocked by the post office which was full of engine revlon indonesian rebels the engine rebels are shut up trench mortars and machine guns and assumes the convoy got there they shot the the troops at her god and a convoy nikolay come to the hole shall we record and you there foreign for five guns so we had to a four on the town and we took out the po shellfish where the indonesian troops had it and then the convoy come through we went back into harbour riyadh oldie um a dutch paper on board and we took him out stereo machine read and read impertinent after go ashore on the garage or lose one to god summerlee warehouses and sean but we didn't match naught to do any fight and the only phaeton rented there was fired a gun because all is on the upper deck at the time when we were called in to fail a notch cord of the upper deck i'm to for um etc um why gun undone i said i'm not gonna i said your to die so i put me on the on the gun the gallery when another one and we had to follow her to two direction you'll love a spotter plane of ascend up body alban arms and as for the blind not entirely retook out you both shoulders show at the good day but somebody did i we did have a meme bowed over annoyed a lot looser dutch people we've located order foreign mistakes and add to sleep down often everyday in different places on the dutch people women drover in the front there till retold round to the young uh says it's just the other ships to home and then burgle aff plunged back on all of the pair of sand also disappeared and how do you feel when you're sailing into a harbour then you're seeing a lot day naval people well you you up your apprehension to stallworth but but the aid you all on you're very short and frightened has your umbrella a drone a drone of the goblin comes back loser on a new thank yourself well i couldn't cure there now abort and that's how you took it um it's us you couldn't turn just thought of all those ones at the time you'd be a nervous wreck but you're eighteen years old and the nineteen years old and on their happened and for to you accept it that's double fear there some time a word or two back now and tie well how can kill her yeah but no amir so reaction it is just a fact of life uh it was exciting happy as sort of yknow the way to end the war were end to end your naval service rays and to be involved in yknow contact right now it is to us notice to bear this time lige and now that you've done shirt and jobs wherein should have well we must kill people why by taking out the post the post office but you didn't see him and you need a new now by during that your help to save the helped to save the loss of wraps on even to free android of four thousand people and at the same feeling about why we were escorting the troopers the fact that we never knew whether we had shrunk or shot maroon are you though because we never say it long enough or we could do for stepped charge a tall rich if that toll gate was a u boat then we might have sunk or a mom got away but l will job or to look after a ship come in for fifteen thousand troops and the lawyers we saved that i'm happy but you'd have known just hope you didn't i just hope that term there wasn't a new about there when the those people are killed though they were only during the sort of thing that we were doing i'm not the job
