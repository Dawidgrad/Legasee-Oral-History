or joined the torpedo huh and um i'm actually didn't really sought me out your got in there that didn't but anyway we got in and got out then and now the chip sat with me we both passed out on and went into jobs in the dockyard basically until we got a ship is this at chatham now this is it oh yeah chatham sorry are you you go i'm getting all mixed up and uh soon as an apron why why mr baird a little bit in the dockyard doing work anna and then the savage huh he she was down on the earth where would the trouble were there and self she came flowing back because she was desperately needed to go on up to the murmansk run and then the chap that her were in there we both wet went aboard urn got picked up and took up to scapa flow and how you live and then the runs one or the other of there what do you remember if the chatham dockyard what was it like as a place for a young boy well i may not owe it all was a young boy knows so evident were wonderful how's your to serve on a me now actually there the first thing i did it because the savage hadn't come up then she was down just finish and dana the where the battle was going on and uh i was put they sent me an adult yard a to do a job long until the ship come up you say and i was in that submarine what i'd go in that submarine which was enjoyed up that unfolded germans in the spaniards and they put that dead body over then the channel between them the member it well i folded the germans that it was a german that were then they actually put a body i got a dead man's body the genuine dead man's body from up north and they put it into this submarine and they actually addressed it all up i was a the man trying to take information to the superb spaniards in him the coast line we are now sunk i took this dead body and bounded and done it all made it all up smart in a uniform not knocks service uniform been enclosed in anna and they put a thing on his arm with gray bigger touchy occasion all don't be information but what would happen it could he spoke to bear german spoke as a you should if it come this film is fantastic anywhere that little submarine and i had to go and work on her just come back from taking the body and float in it in this between the spanish cos lloyd to drip ashore and addressed them all up as the only that this ought not even now and it all worked what was it like going to the savage for the first time when you're yknow your first proper draft humour but i'll tell you what it were she was down on the uh battlefront and she was called away because she was needed for this we were done' don't pay they've gotten wavered even to work in the dockyard into data on and then vittles in in the canteen at night and anyway we got point four and we both wept told to get a kit already integrity and the dockyard on the savage came in from being down and yeah on the bank where i was worried him and she's been polaroid up and they both loading or restore for need alongside and wake up called and put a border and why that's as quick as that but don't tell him the blow that was where my a died not both three weeks ago and we both together you save by boat took the course together and everything and we still together and we both got onto the savage she came in then in the afternoon um-hum and pulled alongside and cut it was it was murder they were even to her they're all sorts of things because we gotta raise up with his big convoy of a coming from canada and already there was loads up and nor scotland way infidel convoy to move all unless you know we never anyway a point for us too and we went on to their year when the way they tell you where you're going and they sent us it straight to the savage in the dockyard and what were the savage was even to do was to take on ammunition and everything else and why it was poor in a bloody ryan that now he bolted down and we were allowed to go down further down the coast was this way joined us she say once we went on we were there for ever yes we've been dropped into her which was all right but we went down to it when it got dark we went down to the ammunition place which was low along my den water from us her name was bucket in down and uh god rama by an admonition she had been in the dark and it was but you are not only thirty point that not poets boards and i were springing up dan carrying starve a porn around pitch black then the ship was shipping water it was so right and so hard anywhere make we're all carrying stuff up along the landing bet you know to fill her up and ammunition anna no um we sailed from their midnight up through the between what all under nap to jonas ebby convoy and you never say it ryan located gone or more in hours a lookout then the whole night where the other solder a bridging the lookout with bloody soaked to the skin pitch black of course we had to put all new ammunition on and off or we could sail from their cosette with ammunition bonkers dan there anyway we got up in the early hours in the morning we reached liverpool in that area and then is sounded allowing up a bit but never left off driving rain and we went right away up to the knows where we go to take his gun lawyer a neighbor all more or less ready to sail whatever the biggest convoy the wall and every top is ship was there and uh gross rejoinder and i'm in on odd never been the bloody say you didn't we were why because we haven't been trainer thought for it it was too quick but anyway but we managed it were hurried him they made her first thing worth your all mixed up because the ship which she had been water all the way up on it i went down into the front or that she had and it was half full of bloody war and it keeps ringing from one side to the other said miss shippen it over the top beauty it would have worked one of the worst storms of the war the burning up that coast and uh but anyway oh yeah i don't know and imagine it i found so bloody sick going up to russia four oh one two bad going up through the chat known as i said that when we actually got go in of thought court lame hold up billeted we had done got room for stone in the main place and i was sick as a dog so all clear miss out went up and they've got the after gun turret turn foreign looking forward so that it was open to the direction we were going on the back of the gun shield and it had curtains if evie germs and go over because they had no daughter nothing behind him and i slept air or noi did threaten height cross or did fell ill and maybe they were somewhere else on a weary didn't win but i'll never sick again well i wasn't sick then george felt sick but i'll never larger again but it has been a good swimmers and my bidding you know and deliver of good adele even but sir war that should upset my lord that or didn't know that i stopped up there until we got two days away then a lawyer for you might say and i'll never looked back the savage was a one of sheep she wasn't gotta depth underwater locked the old up and down engine ones she had she had electric turbines start so steam turbines made all the electric but she didn't draw up as much under the water as an ordinary destroyer or an ordinary sloop which was proved on the last day of the war who are the convoy and we were all up waiting around outside to go through the mountain gap into into the russian end and uh that a u boat was waiting for us and we're all there and there's the convoy was coming in notes on the telly sometimes control we're coming in and spreading about but the duke the german awaiting underneath the cliff bottoms then you could only go into the dockyard through an entrance not much wider than knack with two great pillars of coast line so you had to give one at a time and the big liberty ships uses squeeze through it and this was the last convoy of the war and uh we were hanging about their ships coming in with stuff to set take in and uh s u boat was lying under the rocks huh under opposite us it was snow in in the morning when we took up their position to cover me as i come in crystal i got liberty ship to wear them you know when where why engine jonah munna from america and the first thing had happened when adam got was torpedo as it went to go through the opening into the harbour will you go but further to it nobody could get through it could see the ship broken off and sunk in the gateway we could it again anyway coast as chaos them because the rest of the patella is there for taylor and paper we copy to bring on were coming in to this big opening where we were all right in what else go in and uh we were already for everything i will they annoy night were put down below to push the what's your name depth charges up or come on and then they were pulling him up ready to go we've never heard of your very tall paid are common oh so i didn't but the others on deck did i could ever come in but i didn't away it were and it went under the savage and it hit the brand new ship just as far away as the other side of the road and everybody would probably killed on it it sunk lower a brand new and but what they needed savage shallow draft shallow drop yeah she as she had flat engines that term red ribbon boys shafts at way knock out the bottom and they drove these two generators are you said a good day and when i'm all jobs as you get in every morning and check order the things that could have stopped it and make sure evident that would want to my job you think a noisy stand near what says good what they were there's no propellers those are as they were on the bigger ships which were right low down one day while we were there and it was only drawn up as much water as one of them and that torpedo went under us one day the other ship the other side and we picked some of the men on six we be buried one for me when in doubt we thought until dark there or the rest of the ship and um you see why couldn't this liberty ship though it it with a torpedo and it blocked the entrance you say that it went down in the entrance how did you get rid of that you remember well i don't know because sir edward up to the russians to do their own work on there so we were pointed until dark that noise and it was snowing at eight in the morning when we started and it till it got dark and wished that we buried one chap it was quite dusk get into and we buried him a pneumatic right up no further to the to come in another way from the north and dare inside the water chris we couldn't get in you say well it was a terrible if it allows convoy and the war and when we came home turn that opened up the russians it was christmas this way around christmas day there and now we were there for two or three days and when we come out we could come out that way a week i made at midnight two of us and we have to go now off run up the coast line and near the one went that we went so near the moment nor listening for u boats and while we were there we would drop in the convoy was ready to commit that was coming out empties oh ready to come out and we were sent eight way on us and the other one to keep anything don't you say and john thornton for anything was them while we were doing as the convoy came out in the pitch black and uh with a torment got light in the morning they were well away from where we were so we added scratch on catcher obviously and which we did and she became more i've never had no problems after the convoys of the arctic and you are mine didn't stay on the savage very long video well i stayed on the on the savage until the german surrender and we came back down to chatham judah marine barracks and the dockyard and all were sent for because she say always a volunteer ah how joined under age hence it made me a volunteer nodded conscripted man we came down to the chatham dockyard i got sent to the uh place where they edit you in and out and i had to pack my kids and the next morning i was put on a trying with hundreds more in dockyard locked in which case and i take him out so you can't get out and this train went straight off flowing down to southampton we got out ruddy great liner their way for us all full of people go on to the far east and when she begins to sound the arpa said and it was our perception when you can't get on any way for people it was a ruddy great american la mina you can think of that i never to honor them mate but anyway we serve that no it within two hours we're on the water go now and that took his sir roared out too ceylon and that's where we but took off her there don't away she went from there could she was loaded to the tarquin we had to stop and start for if we go to the canal to get out to get out to the barn a man yknow because he would tell me got there with pitch black and when we went on from there dance the next morning through the canal but she was such a big ship and the next thing we went no doubt to ceylon and that's where they bumped us off was there any any remember anything of that troopship oh no they want no bloody room for us we added they on the top deck and eight were blowing a gale already but it would be ready guile and all air kit had been left down below it would dumped when he got loads of women on their in uniform and her go to sleep on the top deck connie was bloody freezing it was but we went to the canal and when roared out then straight out to salon and i dumped is pretty incredible really when you say that yknow one minute year in early honouring a bashful and then that's really i say so quick at work she would they will wait him troops usually when she was full apple those two on them they had to our name did you have any fair of going to the far east now didn't want it below deck i don't have me now how to end a logging three million what it molly below it but don't i didn't whenever i wanted it you say as while run away and join the navy on a wanted the navy and when that all came well i mean i went on top of the world she was a nice ship that i'd never than any more than anything and she was not under chatham ship music but everybody else we're going on now gave sophia but there's one blow neighbors in the same messes me they used to sit opposite me at the table and uh oh don't worry took a took to me but anyway if he found out that albert to chatham man than that was what o things started it she shouldn't have been there really but everybody else we will not bricks together but hey where we used to go down to sleep below if we if we want your any danger were used open the lower down you down there you've got another mistaken my young your amex if if you can and um that he was in the same messrs may sit on opposite me and any just use a sneer at me and no one ever had a bloody enemies on the ship i may mitchy quartermaster it didn't you say and because i'd give my quota run as a ship and then the captain yeah me up his cabin and that a jack where man tell me what you want me to do and if it was a very nice and made her i was in charge of the steerage which means that the other chaps are under my stride and my mom never stared but the ship but how anton and then it ain't got a campus lot you where you say they all angela you got numbers flicking backward and forward than you ever read em and that we did everyone than the old one what about this ship the japanese shit that you give escorting tell me about that yeah well that was the biggest their crew is i can't think and and don't ask me the name i can't tell you but it were the biggest one i had the that out and she had been bombed and she lay in the arbor we used a good lawyer every tommie went in and out but we thought she was on the bottom but she wasn't but anyway it was the biggest one in a japanese ships and in had been bombed on it had been in singapore arbor for quite some time since it was it and the anyway and me no no i were making ready to tell it and sink ye say and we got chose to do it and we were come in on her way home as it happened and if we left singapore whither her where the tug weather to tell whether actually and uh she was a massive ship and she had been emptied in everything and it got dark and we come on up the malacca straits and they got to this point wherewith she's post had been sunk the deepest water go she was the biggest were naiad at the time and consequently where it would pitch black and whereon a away come into como muse a come to midnight and uh two two japanese tugs you would tell gina i'd been toner rode out on air what was far away from us further than that they're big oh sir they were from it but over coming up again to coach longing and wave a further eight where we could keep our eye on everything and as a sign that got pitch black amid itami got to the point which we had accomplished reading we got a sinker on i started the ship coming up and left her they bolted and left the ship where no headway and she come half way up nearly to wage exposed to been sung and i expect i don't know what a rare captain got permission to sing her but it was midnight pitch black that's why i dare say it slowly hannah and thy danish into the black men gone a cushy drifted she loves you wouldn't drift further you are mentioned a massive here but she was only just off the coast line as we thought pitch black i'm still on the bloody will i am a course look in height the willows wally because we won't go in we would just aubrey and me i suppose the captain got in touch with their people and they said what to do oh so we had to send man over with depth charges could we carried depth charges and they gotta put the depth charges of the lowest possible in the ship chris had nobody on there and a minute were massive and i'd got to war everything up and we the all we could do was you there depth charges and and draw him as it yeah all we could do well why did we did it him amid not when we started and we were drifting as per way perhaps as his first elves drama and uh though she couldn't do much really critical air motor boat went over and they took i think i put four depths yard you dinner in the motorboat and that's all she had told you see carrie and so they took them over from off averse i rode crew you sir he doing it and whatever they done i went aboard the ship and they took these depth charges as the captain had said i gotta be done and put him right down in a low renders i could get other ship couldn't me she what a bloody massive saying and um i did have one i couldn't fu's everything but would make explode and came back to us and dying she did she went down and below the bottom oh and she went down of course we never see no more could be left her there and whether she she went to further up the coast when she wanted to suffer from penang the ship one may have gone up towards penang and did you see i going down oh yeah we watched with their search lloyd yeah for better things ze here who we only one till we say a more or less the master was sticking out of seeing us all but you still go in chief still going down sure she pitched and then put depth charges all away along sir when she got to the certain depth that opened the depth the near the bottom of the ship to let the water in as you do and where to sit there until it filled up and unfair discharge anymore bloody in ever so long ago the fabulous but gotta you were one lave their cameras so just talk a bit about have you would mind sweet yknow it's a story about what you do how you do it for one of those various ways you can do what you can do it with the wires i we floats on different ways you can put depths down for them down to certain debts and leaned in a way to them down a pains what's going to be there with them and that when you come back but basically only do it to clear the ocean in the air you're in and if there's been ships colliding with him yeah we get some guy we'd get sent out there to sweep it did you have any near misses with the minds well we've got him come up beside us yeah i'd tell me too but when you're all joined together we walked great strong lawyers you're in formation like that on each side i be goes out to another ship and i go out to another one and then out to the other than you got seven but you're the one in the front you're the one that's got probably more equipment that you can sound and then the others he said i do that sort of thing i keep improving on certain things and we may have been a little bit better oh i don't know but that joe you sweep that's weep you're all overlap each other she taught you as you got wise holding you together in a position now knows or done for he they bring me up to sit there were nice or do you have a certain distance and then boys university for the next day and that's how you do it that's when you do it that tony push weep but there are other ways you can you can sweat and some were you seduce watch sweet with the long was really great big thing on air quarter deck and it was foreign every lawyer and we used to let that the things on that yknow and captain on the bridge they say let go and then you stop it when he tells you grease and massive sad sack of lawyer on a drum and there's not everywhere birthday he put anything on the end of you see when you can get it out and if it will explode mines or you'll find it if there's any day you know where you stand a little bit better if you raise your done on look really and you can look down in the sea but we used to sneak up on we snagged up on an aeroplane then there that crashed on what should we were told it well don't now or never sir hint hipper we are now when it snagged it on they got ran a ship that it were to blame and i don't know who i knew which we didn't stop but you've got somebody that nice something i've been here you mentioned this about this chat then yknow this chatham and the pompey rating when you say made life difficult what what do you mean added he do that what was what i'll tell you what happened we come home to england an idea or most of the time on because i used to go and sit with him and then i'll take over us all responsible for my sake so so they didn't know whatever along dying or does tanker is enabled them and one night as doing i know how to be a quartermaster which means when we were at anchor i added devoured duty of the backyard his ship where they where they come in and out of it when they go ashore and winding and uh and ordered the log books one evening on i was on duty there doing none and we will most coming home at this
