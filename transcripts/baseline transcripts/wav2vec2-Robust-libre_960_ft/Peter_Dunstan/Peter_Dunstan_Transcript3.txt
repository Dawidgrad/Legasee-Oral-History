what was the sort of sense on board when you knew that you were now engaged probably for the first time in a proper battle with serious you know and with potentially a serious outcome am i can't real tell you my my gunnery position when i was not on duty in the machine shop and that was on the port side number one duel purpose for five point two five a gun and my position was in the transfer section where the shells came and the ammunition came up from the magazines and into the space where i was which was then transferred to thee to the er guns and what was i mean that must have been an immense spectacle was it terrifying i mean can you can you try and recall some of what you were seeing and i it was in a seat more or less a sealed compartment on the first one lot on a deck below the upper deck and you didn't see anything all you knew as the fact that a when when the guns fired you had to get another operate a lever and get another not a section of ammunition up from the magazines so you didn't know what was going on all you knew was the expo the noise of the guns firing was the hood on the port side of you as well no she was ahead of us she was about what a quarter mile i think it somehow i can only only estimate that she was about a quarter of a mile in front of the prince of wales and the only thing that happened when she blew up a there was a piece of the hood a that landed somehow or other in a space of that a piece of the hood when she blew up a landed on the on the focal the front of the prince of wales a one of these amazing things one the two two ships a quarter of a mile apart one blows up and a piece of piece of the ship that blew up landed on the prince of wales when you were hit do you recall feeling that that impact no you you you're talking about a a thirty five thousand ton battleship and an explosion of a shell hitting you am you didn't even hear feel it what happens after an engagement like that for i mean this is the first time isn't it what what you know what do you do as a as a young man who's just been involved in something like that with the noise in men how how do you wind down or do you not no you don't just just one of those things a no more than as i'm sitting here now i mean just you're trying to obey orders and you just carry on okay so after you've engaged to bismark you had back to the u k is that right yes what do you recall of that and what was it like you know been back cause you've obviously been out you come back did you get leave oh well we went straight into knowing that we got was the trouble at well at the time there was a flooding in the after magazine and we went straight into rosyth and straight into the dockyard at the holder dry dock dried up dried up at rosyth the course when they when he pumped the water out of the prince of wales so they got down to find out where the flooding was in the after magazine they found this dirty great big fourteen inch shell a lying there not far from the after magazine i tell her that there was a right panic everybody clear the ship and the ship was cleared and then they got down and cut the side of the side plate of the ship out and lifted the the shell out and a repaired that and then we were allowed back in aboard ship again great fun
