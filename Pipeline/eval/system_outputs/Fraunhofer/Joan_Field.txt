i saved from nineteen forty one to nineteen forty five um basically um western approaches that includes at plymouth right away up might react to scotland top of scotland and what's your name joan field i was joan rose kitchen where are you from and and what the circumstances to you where i actually was born in cambridgeshire i'm not going to finish court boundaries yeah i think it was fifteenth century thatched cottage which my grandmother's small holding i was born there um my parents worked on a small holding i'm a nineteen so she six thirty five thirty five thirty four thirty four we moved to a new chain of waiting on city where my father thing gotta employment and i lived there went to school there um i wanna scholarship in a bursaries to um sharers when i score which is in winning on city and i matriculated at which was then you could call matriculation i was in seventeen and i want you to join them the walker broken out by them obviously i wanted to join their friends i went down and thought well hope hopefully get in a frenzy if not i'll have to go into the west but they accepted me into the ruins um the time they were only i'm taking on cooks and stewards which of course i did not want to do had an eye tests they decided i got perfect eyesight then and so i was told i was going to be a signal i didn't mean much to me but i didn't mind what it was and i was called up just a month before christmas two eight ship has kept below which is being laurentian year was that i just strange a thing ninety i think it was nineteen forty one beginning middle nineteen forty one and i saw bruce this marvellous all the officers at christmas were waiting on fresh horses are lovely idea this is because i was short lived it was very tough at cobra um you will give him two weeks for what they call probation and you will give me all the dirty jobs to do you can no more scrubbing the floors crying in a loose it was make or break time really squadron the until sculptural oh hated squad drill blow caught a lovely actually after that but that's another story i heard at the end of a fortnight um we were accepted some of them went home some of them went awol if he went awol any you just went into munitions or whatever but if you didn't really like it perhaps the west would have had you we will first choice in those days everybody wanted to go in the wrens and so i started my visual signaling and coding i still get some coding as well but that basically visual signaling and from the course lasted i think for six months as he was you'd pause six months former on her for months for months i think and on that chart after that time he went on leave you would then drafted different places we all pause put down for plymouth all one's has come cells because i let anyone in gotham city obviously so souls i want you i ain't developing open never even heard of your eye to find on the map when i got the draft or didn't even where it was found it and i saw this is lovely that would be lovely up there can i get justice going back a little bit what would you say that you emphatic that you wanted to join the reins over any other service wide i don't know i'm i got no naval all my my father and my grandfather or served in the army um i don't know what it was i say i love to see um maybe the uniform is a big really i'm sure i don't really know but i always wanted to be in the renders it was just something i think stephanie had the same way when you read her book um it's attraction to it um i suppose in a way it's our shop and clamour of the rendering there you mentioned cabinet and dimensions yknow veggie visit ship fertilization and coding but i'd like to know more about what what you were learning and how you learnt this realization and what were in what was the process or first of all you got a gun and morse code and yknow that evening at seventeen that's a bit tricky but still you learn morse code um and that is absolutely drums into the morse code um is it purely repetition yes really and truly and you'll learn gimmicks to learn yet you know you're o f f for face yknow you're not resort to gimmicky things to remind you it's tough we were all put into classes and visual signals as classes all began with a fee and my class was very shy and i can't remember it stephanie's classes wishes just mentioned in the book the wireless telegraphy his classes all began with w light was pipe and the coding classes all began with se having anchors and each call course was in different lengths and we learned morse code semaphore um it's a signal with flags you know right the old nelson signal which kept changing learning the phonetic alphabet which halfway through our course changed so that americans could understand it which annoyed us why should we have to change after all these years anyway so that phonetic alphabet which um every class was manned by an x serving man usually a chafee who'd never dealt with ripping before and some of them were bit chaff bits of but we needed it because we were completely roared to his or we have all we were taught naval discipline and different time marches you know how to twenty four hour clock which records we hadn't started to use them the basics really basics and i found it quite enjoy a boy was just like going to school and what about your henry where where you stand them and pretty spot and were not too bad it was an old niche and hearts they've been used by um and i think mentioned stephanie mentions in her book i certainly be used by the post office it but you're all old nessun hearts on his big big sight atom newton said we'd just outside warrington and it's obviously now been developed into a big housing it is said that it was a very large came um mosey the granary but it was also the men on board as well they were gunning um i seem to be doing w t but we will oversee been trained to take over some of the signal stations from the men to release them at which we don't afterwards helplessly so i got my draft up to open but when you get a draught and what would you know how how how is your communication your parents and this draft you say obama by me where's that how did you get there what did your parents think well a bit staggered remind me of my father but miss my father took me up to euston station i got this draft just a thing and report to the um i suppose it was a solemn patrol police often use then i was sent on to him when i go from king is now has sent to winter kings cross and had to go to used um or as military style for an audience civvies only allowed to take a suitcase of close one one outfit of civvy close and then the usual pajamas always fish farmers um the usual sort of the us you we're going into hospital at only one set of civic civilian clothes and one to report to this place in any one of the stations the i think it was kings cross and they took me under their wing and sorted me out got me onto the train my father saw me off and that was really all that happened i ended up start wherever i go and and yknow you mauls or mars because all the um quite a few sailors on going up to the different that came back on leave and they all kinds of me they'll realize what what what was happening the train was crowded i can remember we couldn't sit down anywhere on one of the sailors put me up on to the top of the rack at the tops like and have a slip i can always remember that um got to um carlyle it was an air raid warning um we had to stay in court all siding for about an hour which meant i had missed my train from carlisle to um sterling where i had to change again so um that was another problem um can't you got your sterling and of course the train to open had gone so i was stranded the w p s my out in a hostile for the night and i went down two o'byrne reported to robin there to the officer in charge urban i was told i was going to repair signal station in the morning and go on to the pier signal station of course i've been kitted up and a capital we would kiss it up but i didn't have any bell bottoms now without a visa essential for a red vs ran because it's so cold so i was issued with bell bottoms and the next day went on joshi nor what were you doing and i thought this is crazy all they sort of business cobbler the boys strict discipline naval discipline nobody seemed to be bothered of open i don't think you think that they realize there was a war on except of course the convoy is coming in and um i liked liked it i don't like scotland stephanie didn't like it i shall meet in her pork if you ever read it um she just didn't seem to mix him very well with scottish people but i had got a scottish grandfather preps us so i did sort of except it more and i realize that yknow they are a bit insular and that they didn't mean to be of pushing but they were increasing it is an insular land up in the highlands i didn't know whether you know the heinous very well hum there are a singer to themselves okay well so just to do me a favor than just described a little bit about a bomb what what the face was lie what what you're surrounded like ways slapped says this is this an openness open yet but we'll talk about the work here says where open festival um i was stationed in what was called the station hotel and their signal station on the pier was only a short walk away and met up with a girl who was going to work with me she'd been thereabout a week we hadn't yet started really getting the convoys in so we were told what was going to happen that chump the convoys would come in and there being a bay and we've had to madame man all the time and we weren't allowed to go on any boats and that's another story um why paramount monitor everything coming in and out we also had to look after funny enough i am already f had sunderland and catalina's up there and um they had a call sign you it's changed every hour and half of them could never ever read it so we used to have to read this code signal for them to send their patrol boat out but that was but unbeknown to a how bay sooner had clue what was going on it was a crazy set out really and i'm so they submarines on patrol duty us to come in alongside the pier we would have to give them their signals um they would enrich out on patrol but was mostly what we were doing it appears signal station but this wasn't adequate enough and gang even signal station which was right around the corner from where we were was still manned by the men and they also have a new as sticks and opening up just below i wish my radar and i'll stick and knew that it was gone by the men and men were going from ghana born and they were going over to this more the arrangement around out there because it was now it was completely alone out there was no no it was knowing habitation of such a few for a few sheep farmers so will you rennes won't allow it up in his more and that's where that photograph was taken unbeknown to anybody so the gamin signal station was going to open up and we were going to go there which meant very great difficulty because from the station hotel to ghana when it was about covered three miles two or three miles in the middle of a night that's note book um so eventually well we saved for about pierre signal station for about i would say about a months before the gain of one was open gave him signal station was then opened up for the rennes and we took over from the men i mean we had an intake than of more vs renders it will now six of us instead of four and we took over caravan from the men very very spartan when we were at the pier signal station we were able to have meals with in a mess proper meals the night watch it would do us up nice sandwiches when we move from pier signal station to the caravan signal station we were stationed at a place called rosy lodge which was very tough going and they didn't like watch keepers because i couldn't handlers they nearly all your your whole the um refinery was righteous or w t operators who works proper watch out as they were nine two five not as we had given we had to do at watch keeping hours say mr navy so if we if you are lucky you got over hot dinner if you didn't you just have a sardine sandwich so we'll food was pretty spas if you read in a book people my friends who read the book say why did you stand it but i said but there was a more and we didn't know any different we had to go do it was our job the men but why it was a it was a very very sparse signal station shall we want me to describe it is a signal station itself was right on the top of a caravan aren't just by john on a jolly house which is the house of the lord and lady of total i think they were caught yes i do and that was on their land and it had been built as a lookout post if i think originally for the coast guard's it was very sparse it was to her to chair place you had to reach it by to capture it it was a climb up a cliff almost a sheer cliff the road went below us and the sheer cliff up which we had to carry the oldest lamp boucher's which was very heavy and then the uh we had to have a father and a coal fire a because we had to be able to burn any confidential books which we had if anything if we had any kind of an invasion we had to put the books and goodness knows how because they were lead line there was saved from but we as well well we had to fall um we hadn't bumped down below anna signal up the top how can you around we had a big ten inch her three orders lamps um yeah haughty a hearty set and it was really just go now that we were just pushed it would deepen um and how far could you see for larry what was your velcro secret military where she's got it we could see right from we can seem all right away doctor morrell over to lose more we had perfect vision oh everything that was coming and going why was not such an important stretch of coastline in terms of the convoys and you'll make a because it was very safe place thought um they could come in it was revealed to have a look at the map is a complete bay and tobermory the escort ships hermetic you're usually pouch hoarsely destroys with doctor convoy of and go up to tobermory there we go up up the sound and mo and if you can visualize a coastline mull almost protects the bay so there's any ships passing have to go round behind the mole they don't realize yknow isnt coming in and have a story about the duke of york um i think it was a very safe haven um they came in and um they were escorted off from us public d'anjou and gorge signed with cook into the cried for unloading or they would massa raised go out as either and expect a tie a of arrival or unexpected times of dispatch coming or going and what was the most shit she sent you ever saw her oh and i don't know a whole harbour would be full i would say thirty or not he's thirty most likely and of course you'd have to have a less and unfortunately yknow using me might be a straggler but they were never came near you did that was a terrible sitting you think when wonder what happened to that one and we had quite a lot of losses unfortunately not in a knot in the bay but you know for coming and going you'd expect to see their yet because we haven't we have a list sensuous which was the confidential list expected time of arrival and you'd give them about two or three hours and never came yknow you're just wonder what happen and they were all manned by um lucy merchantman so they're moss wasn't very good but now and again you'd get a ship which you have a few new ex united states when when america came in if it was better planned you know the liberty ships came then and if they were better much better man who were um a little bit overpowering rarely because it was so shall i say this over clever they used to send moss at the race of not sinking that we can answer it now we will send back at the same rate um mrs bobby didn't like the americans very some affright they tried all sorts of things i try to come up on bought up to our signal station we we couldn't would have come in and we're not allowed to have them in we had one or two problems with rich people coming up um one shall i go on one night um i could hear footsteps coming out the thing and a knock on our door and i thought yknow this voice i didn't know who it was at the man's voice we already have a friend murders inverary vs ran murdered inverary on night watch so we were all very well or by which it on his boat we all were taught how to handle a pistol we had to go on the range which was um the our f had arrange and we were taken onto the range via an instructor and taught a fire a pistol and i have a very small rice and i was torture fire calling my rear so i could follow demetrius we also had a rifle of openly signal station or it wasn't though it is with no having for the pistols well but it's his rifle wasn't it was just there as as a warning i heard us first and this is perfectly true where i heard his footsteps coming up and i said to my apo i don't like this very much so this movie kept knocking on our door in the end cutlass rye for that's what i can't and i knew is unloaded and i thought now what are we going to do so i put him out of the way and as this voice came through the thing i lifted the utmost gonna clock him on the head with it he said it's all right shown it's only me and it was one of the sick one from down below stupid who'd got a date i had changed watches with a girl shortest hotel is really he always used to come up for a cup of tea this time and have a cup of tea with her and he thought she was on watch and nearly got himself killed and it would have been you know whether being quiet my rights because we're now but you ain't got a great big prohibited now since up with widow but i've yknow if never came to anything and i never ever reported it because i've got him into terrible trouble but we were armed but only with a pistol and are at a rifle with no ammunition because we've had a friend in inverary what was the circumstances i don't know i'm afraid all there is a need to know you never ever told what happened we we just told to be very aware and you'll take extra precautions the pain of seeing a mensch stephanie mentions this in our was well we never ever knew what happened and why we had what we sought was a spy of a man used to come here it was all prohibited land from perseverance but this man you should come down sit on the rocks away for the convoys and he had binoculars and a camera we were not allowed to take photographs of the convoys we could take photographs around the cabin at around the same but not the convoys are allowed to i was so we reported as man to our headquarters pack in our signals back in the station hotel nothing ever happened about it so it's i just disappeared now we never ever heard weather it was joseph local newspaper man or whether he was as kind of a spy a well he was just interested in ships would never heard sir i'm afraid in those days it was all need to know you know but have told and just yknow just picking up on the americans who are you are you are so talked as rich as the americans gave you some hassle and yes where they would try to bribe as they wanted to come up the signal station um look around real carly we've got some nylons oh honey we've got than others on board yknow this like i mean so stupid and so childish we took a dislike to the what we didn't like was the way they used to treat their officers complete disrespect they would call them by their first names which we thought was terrible and the captain's all the oil no officers never seemed to take any notice of them and we were in open one day shopping and the americans were came came on board came on purpose shopping as well and um we've got to take us for a cup of coffee okay fine which they did we took them to do y m c a had a cup of coffee going back some of their offices are coming the other way we were appalled the way they spoke no saluting higher higher cap this is terrible i mean i can't describe it they just another world away and they were trying to bribe as with bananas and ignited arms and we just didn't you know it didn't you know we thought there was a childish with all this very fast flashing moss you touched on the different methods of yknow communication he had to seven four yet it still to that the lamps there yet what madame so just what when did you use different types of communication near isn't one specific type in a bar in the station near always by moss by light or some time by r t i'm nearly always really the artie why we really only use for the asdic station um that mostly it but the oldest and a big challenge which was very difficult of course a handling had to go out on the bow and quarter up there the winds were always at gale force where was had to hoist the coins for the width of the weather every day we had to hoist the cones for had gone voice to know what the weather was with accounts the coins were we've come as a shape that you're hoisted it now comrades which way now oppose for little outfits for north wind and the office itself written very primitive but it gave them some idea of a wail of the wind i mean not analysing me you could tell the way the wind was blowing just from which we always had to fry the wire innocent and we had to abide by the colors of the whiteness and put it up as a sunrise and down at sunset so the innocent was always flying savoured always tell which way the wind what's gonna blow he without a coin when it was a gale force winds were why we should occur not which sometimes meant the comb was up for days because the gales would blow up there pay very very windy and sometimes we would have to be lashed on to the tennis because it was so windy you kick being blown away it was very very cold and wet very very we were always wet but we didn't seem to matter we'll have to have a bath or shower oh we went back to the coach of the year and hello would you be c'est situated at them well the night watch was a long what we'd go on somebody like eight o'clock and come off at eight o'clock the next morning that was a very long one the other watchers were pretty well for hours on the four hours are off but in the night watch was with a tough one that you and you had to walk there and back first of all we had to walk we couldn't be rejected because a man in men and as fixation down below us thought transport i will work in the same watches are well yes ok then they decided that would issue is with bicycles which they do we had a rent officer came up a serious and she said this isn't good enough and then they supplied transport for us so we didn't have to work the night watch back some forms of three or four miles in the pitch dark the monarch will the coast road but first of all we have to before they realize that what was happening as the maiden and there's a story about the duke of york yes the duke of york were we we never had a very big ships a biggest ship now um escort ship will ever really came into us were were destroys or cover corvettes because they always used to go into mouth to wait for the convoys to go back out so we never really had anything what i would call a pretty large i was on watch with stephanie um but on this particular occasion and now if you can picture yeah the islands in the sea and suddenly you see a great big cross anchor of across mouse coming actually what on earth is there you had no idea what he could possibly be we had no eighty eight for anything we had nothing what everything we're moving very slowly yknow i got bigger and bigger we couldn't believe it of course it we call the up and no reply were cosette was worrying no reply for his especial every every hour it changed the colonel upside could change on a code book so you would call him up by the code which it were for the day ah no reply so we have a little ship we had two ships actually one was called the southern star one was called the seldom wave they were patrol ships which used to patrol backwards and forwards among the convoys all the time they were old why would call something like a corvette um i think they were old shawl as they were manned by um navy and they were at what if any trouble we called them up immediately and don't we call got the southern star she was a white way at way out over a mile and also what it was all about her she said i can't see anything from here cause they will be your way way but she's going to investigate she's and if it's anything trouble are shot across its bowels upset anyway this thing got bigger and bigger eventually i managed to call up i always did punting torso that's what visual signals are called bunting chances was asleep i should think he's all what we only corrosive around these islands had he came back quickly with g of wine instead of a pennant number because all ships are pennant numbers i have a pendant number bishop or a code by came back with nothing quickly dear what and i says to stephanie idea of what you've york i say cautious a battleship i sent him based her nursery quickly phoned our base they didn't believe us because nobody had caught on any she eh anyway the captain of the captain arose base came rushing down took him about half an hour to get to us by which time she was in full view matrix it just filled up the whole of the bay i've never say that you like it and close it was greatly who are about this why didn't we know of course she was on she was on pilgrimage up to norway after him shawn horse and she was doing this to buy sparrows she's or are we got chimes you do i don't know why they did it they were way of course i mean nothing whatever she must have known it will weigh very well it's very james yourself there but she did she came right passes receiving just of mo i mean i could show you exactly where she was it was a nap um she just appeared behind the islands as if it was on some kind of a film it was incredible and as for the singing usually towards freedom that the story lovely story but nobody ever really again they need to know whenever any found that but we realised afterwards what it was all about sharing their way up to the battle in your way drink of took place the day our yes and we d day came we had all ships we couldn't understand it why they looked so dreadful they were all for the battered ships with or we may see some awful sights but they were there about fifty fifty of them i should think with with twos destroyers turban and something else on one was the durban a moment some maybe i've written it may be she mentioned in the book and we thought gosh i destroy doesn't it looks terrible state surely a navy now therein we had no idea what they were they came in i suppose they were in about a week for more than ten days enough time for stephanie to get to know this signalman and i say must pretend days um we still couldn't understand why why they were so and why they didn't cause a one of a stage two or three days but this seemed to be a long time and we shall allow something's from his going on then all our we were tall wearing it will be not allow to post any more letters all letters who were to be cans all our passage out was to be council everything going out from the base was to be stopped and we all leave was stopped with a one some things in there yknow you get that hum we thought we were where are they going what are they gonna do of course open the block ships um the night before d day these they didn't know what they were doing they had no idea what it was all about also they said the night before they will seem to be getting ready the night before a big ship came alongside some of them and took off a lava staff whistle i don't usually unload here it goes to gorge and grand hook but they won't wielding all sorts of self and watched him through the telescope no chairs and tables and all sorts of things were coming out i couldn't understand this you know next day we will when we came up a march they were all busy getting ready to go out we had now expected time of departure at all i they all just seem to disappear and are to patrol ships had no idea they said what do we do where they're going way were what we we hadn't we couldn't tell them because it was so secret and that's the end of the data that was all the block ships going down they all look rotten or ships and nobody wanted the two destroyers have been so battle scar that they were almost unthinkable drinkable so they were the two big books ships and these was sent home to help out we have ever heard until the end of a more where it was all about these of offices there with a block ships thing that you touched on earlier but i'd like more clarification on us is that they become boys essentially you did talk about this documentation can you just explain that again for me and you know how the da process a despatch rider would arrive from base it's a station hotel wishes to their base statue rider would arrive with a confidential letter which which contain iti over next convoy coming in and right so you then get out pretty in front of you put it up and wait for the first one litre succumb in eighty eight oh nine hundred we made a good start to come into one three hundred had obviously been march i suppose i think from ireland they within sort of marked across in a get each area them coming across that was literally how we got less iti a's from of despatch rider confidential letter would come um but i suppose i bought every the convoys were coming in quite regularly at least once a month coming in but charm they've got and once again i was always really or was chock a block and of course you got there also got the are f boats going backwards and forwards with the sunderland on their um catalina's so it was quite a busy little harbour on every single thing had to be logged and knocked out identified and put down yknow it was so you had to be almost pretty well aware what was going on all round you try in the air with a catalina's this is why we had to have seldom wave and southern star who used to be out they were also signaling and trying to get them it was really like a great big herd of sheep and to shepherds trying to crack them in it was it could have been organized chaos but it wasn't it was very very good it's always worked just really shepherding these the ship's meal um deepness big liberty ship they were quite big as it is liberty ship have his own so call sign that you would a ways yes each why we knew we have we knew each one was if we hadn't identification for each one so we could mark them off if not we cut where everyone's name ok don't but yes we hadn't identification for either of them hum it's you had to concentrate quite hard when they were coming in you couldn't extension wonder because you know you've gotta be so quick and you talked about some of them knock coming in attitude what what what how'd you feel when you yeah you've done five convoys and if missing twenty bows knows what was the feeling well what festival when it first happened you if it oh i wonder what happened to those i'm hope they're all right who again but this time you've done it for about a year or so you just accept it yknow you what do you what do you do you don't know what's happened to them you never know what's happened k u got this need to know what we wish to try and find out but we never told the three of us already been sunk off somewhere you see i wanted to help fall they go what happens to a man yeah what happens at all that lovely stuff that was coming in oh going out yeah you just don't know you just never knew just how to accept whatever was happening just and leave it put all your sort of personal feelings aside because it was no good wary about it what could you do i'll have what you remember a v e day of a dado v they fake are the a v i was still on watch gravy um i don't remember much about it because we are in scotland we were invited to a big parade in edinburgh um which we did take part in later on but the big fee prayed we thought was home we get there i mean he's is it a journey from open to edinburgh me it's you just don't get on your bike and go you got um i don't remember now we just had a party that was all we had a party um i think we will wish you'd we were never allowed overseas happily the rum i'm from russia but sometimes we use ago all ships was come in and we're to get out of a total rum but i didn't like it very much because after the after the war at which i was in the royal naval association for not charlie facts up here and i was vice chairman of the new branch of the royal navy association and um they used to go out with tarts up there or was offered me i like it it's too hot and too ferrari for me um so ve day really just with a a trough of rum and in these are in the in the base and v j day the end of the water at the end of the war where was i at the end of the war i was at towered point and genuine there's always went on as the convoys were no longer needed we were no longer needed some marriage stephanie went to ireland i went to tell it point the nun but to a brontosaurus and that was a ship's coming down the clyde um and that was where i spent p j j is here again and just another niza really you can't know more about it and from there i was um i could always stay in the ruins or i could be pitied you have made from their which i was dim up because i was wanting to go one of social services course so i'd already lined up where i want to do in a way i regret now not staying in i think in a way but and it didn't work out and how do you reflect on one end and how many years i enjoyed it i quite right it um i'm glad i did it um he was an experience of course i never have again and a nobody would ever have a game because it will never happen again hum i enjoyed my time up there i loved the highlands um
