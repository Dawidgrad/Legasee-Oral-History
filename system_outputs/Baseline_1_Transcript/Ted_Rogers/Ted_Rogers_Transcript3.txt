let's talk about the day that you were told peter what do you remember of the well with many information it's on there but i'll just tell you about it in brief you see always on the bridge as one of the lookouts the third mate was in charge of the the ship at that time because you took in china the cunning the ship the captain wasn't always on the bridge and am we had a look out up the crow's nest high up and at just about eleven twenty eleven thirty in the morning on the sunday he shouted torpedoes on the starboard bow i looked there and they saw four coming towards us and then the third officer gave a command to steer towards them or to starboard because then you present a smaller target but it was too late by the time we were swinging round there you can't do light that you know takes a bit of time to get round the two hit the ship one went ahead i could see that still it wasn't the bridge another one came in i thought it was here and it was the had gone right through the ship but eventually it was set deep so it went underneath and one ahead two underneath and two hit her mid ships and the ship went on fire and then the captain gave orders to abandon the ship because it was quite hopeless and to go to the lifeboats and we had four link boats two on each side and i went to my life boat there was nothing there to be blown up in the explosion or the two life boats on the starboard side were in splinters but disappeared with the explosion and so i went to the the the the role went to go to the one on the opposite side of your own i went there and a the only people were getting in it and it was being lowered down so i got in that boat and it got stuck on the way down because the ship was heading over to starboard and it got stuck in the twin eck and by pushing and pushing they freed it but when it damaged the boat and when it got down to the water it sank now it was my first trip so i didn't know much about life boats so most of us then jumped over the side and the captain was going round he let go a number of rafts from the ship and these rafts were the sort of home made tights with oil drums and wooden snaps on them anyway i swam to one of those along with some other members from the the sinking life boat and anyway they managed to salvage that boat because the the air the air tanks lifted it up a bit and they patched it with canvas then bailed it out you see so then we all have one other boats you see the other boat went round circling and picked us up from the humbelifraft you see and then the managed to get more people in the damage boat and then the submarine was on the surface taking films and then the the third mate remembered that he hadn't ditch these secret code books so he tried to get back on board climbing up ropes and then the the submarine machine gun am i didn't try they didn't hit him it was a warning i think so he came down again and then shortly after that the ship wasn't sinking quickly enough for him so he put another torpedo in and then it went up like that and down and the shocking moment when you see the ship completely disappear on your left in a little boat hundred and twenty miles from shore then we were overcrowded because the boats were made of the capacity of thirty two and because of the extra damage boat and some we had more we had over forty in it and it was sitting like this you know and the a we had also the second engineer in the boat and he was badly burnt cause the engineer was on fire when he got out and he he died the next day and so we had to put the body over side and see the shocks coming and then we towed the raft for a couple of days because we need to get exercise you could go on the raft you see because the boat was so cramped and then the the sharks were coming up at the leak i remember the boson had an axe was hitching the sharks are they right after that time we thought well it's dragging us too much too much of a drag on the boat we're not sailing quickly enough as we were sailing and rowing and so we let it go and that was another sort of dramatic moment because that was the last line of safety that we had left you know and am so that was on the sunday when we were torpedo and then on the wednesday we saw sandler flying boats on some days but they didn't see us and and it was very hot the sun was belting down you know one of the one of the crew got deli with delirium because a noble got sunstroke thinking he was raving and shouting around was very difficult and then we were running short of water we only had water tanks water barrels you know and am then on the wednesday afternoon one of these old walrus aircraft came and i saw us and they were the old sea plains and the sea was quite calm so he landed near us and asked if anybody was injured cause he could take to hospital but he would have been putting his pilot his co pilot in our boat as was only a two seater so nobody was badly injured so we said okay so he said he gave us another across the star which we are all already and then he took off and then that evening we saw smoke coming out ship coming to pick us up we thought but then there was a tremendous sort of hurricane storm and we had to fight for the boats and the so and it was raining as well but it really we got plenty of water to drink by the time the storm had subsided with no sign of the boat at all the other sand but that night we saw land and we rode all night and we in the morning we didn't see a thing as the visibility was very low from a boat and we'd been swept round into the bay you see by the current anyway we carried on on our compass we had a compass direction and that a late afternoon a taller and dave taller came out of freetown and picked us up not far outside the harbour we didn't do the whole distance actually and then we were we were taken in and put on shore and there were so many what they called buddy's distressed seamen there because a lot of ships had been sunk just outside and then we were put on the cydia troop ship i got a picture of it actually in the term sent back to england and so that was my introduction to the merchant navy and to the war
