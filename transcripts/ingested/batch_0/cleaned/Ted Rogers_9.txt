how long were you in the merchant navy after that after the war i stayed on in the merchant navy until i left the merchant navy i couldn't leave i had to get demobilised you couldn't leave immediately after the end of the war we had to wait another year then you had to be demobilised by the government ministry of transport i've got my demobilisation certificate there then i had decided already that i must train for the priesthood you see so then i went into a seminary when did you have a moment that you wanted to join the priesthood well there were several moments if you like one was just after we'd been torpedoed and i was in the sea and i thought you know what can i do for my life and then others were in the tropics you see especially when you are an officer of the watch four hours at night in the tropics with the ship steaming along beautiful stars and soon on and you're looking out but you can't see anything there apart from the wondrous stars but it's conducive to praying you know the glory of the lord and the stars and we had to do a bit of navigation so we knew a bit about stars and things like that you know and that was another area that had a big impact on me i had a girlfriend in the interim and then when i was in my last year at sea i had to make up my mind whether i sort of told her on what happened and eventually i decided that i wanted to be a priest and so i wrote to her about my decision you know so that was another rather dramatic moment if you like
