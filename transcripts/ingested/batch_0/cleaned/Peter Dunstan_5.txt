alright so after you'd been into the mediterranean was it good to get was it good to go from you know to start seeing parts of the world do you have a recollection of the fact you've gone from america canada back to med you never thought about it it was just a duty and you just carried on its only now you asking these questions that i can think back about it i've had no the other time you were on duty you had a job to do and that's it you carried on you never thought about seeing gibraltar or america or anything like that just it was part of duty and you just carried on while you're on the ship and you'd been on it for sort of nine you know eight seven or eight months now what's the camaraderie like now did you form did you start to form good friendships yes i mean as a royal marine detachment of a hundred and eighty although you formed a closer relationship with the ten other royal marines or nine other royal marines that were on the mess deck i mean the mess deck comprised of a hundred and eighty ten ten twenty mess decks and there were nine other royal marines on your mess deck you got to know them more than anything else there were other royal marines that were in the squad that would you'd train with that you knew and we were friends with but you mainly got to know the nine others on your mess deck what sort of stuff did you get up too with them can you remember you know cards games fun jokes now what was it i was making i can't remember now but we all had a hobby and i know i had a i can't remember now what it was i was making something on the mess deck in the evening when you were free and you all had a hobby you were either writing or doing something like that of an evening how much you know how big was the room how big was the space mess deck well now i should say it was about ten times the size of this room each mess deck because at night in the ceiling were big steel pipes or hangers and you used to hand your hammock on those on these hooks and you slept in the hammock above the mess deck what was it like was it easy to adapt to night sleeping in a hammock ooh yes in those days you were young and innocent still innocent but you just got on with it i mean a hammock is quite comfortable for sleeping in and the old soldiers as we used to call them the old royal marines they used to help us youngsters at anything that wanted doing get us into the life of living aboard sounds food do you remember much of the food i'm just trying to get sense a of what life was like when you weren't because obviously ninety nine percent boredom and one percent terror so i was just wondering about that you know when you're not working what you're doing well as i say you all had a hobby of some sort an another and then each day one person on the mess deck was responsible for the food and you used to have to go down to the galley the main ships galley where all the food was cooked and tell them the mess number and they used to dish out the rations for the food then you used to go back to the mess deck and put the plates out and either help yourself or you served it out so everybody got equal rations cause you very likely know where if you put a plate down on a table with six people there's one of the six is going to be greedy and grab as much as they can so as royal marines i mean you dished it out equally and everybody got the same you knew that the next day one of your mates on the mess deck will be doing cook of the mess and so if he didn't get treated right you didn't get treated right so you mucked in messed in with the comradeship that developed had you lost any when you got on board and you were in your mess had you lost any of your comrades during any of the conflicts that you had the battles no no we didn't lose anybody in october you set sail for the far east oh yeah well it was called g force that was it yes we set sail to the far east called in at cape town cape town was neutral they were told at seven o'clock in the morning it's funny how i can remember some of these things seven o'clock in the morning on the radio cape town was told that the battleship the prince of wales was coming in the repulse that was with us she went up to durban we called in at cape town seven o'clock in the morning the people in cape town were told that the battleship the prince of wales was coming in and i seemed to recall about eleven o'clock twelve o'clock we eleven o'clock we pulled into cape town twelve o'clock three or four hundred people waiting at the gates so that those that were on leave that day that were free to have a day's leave you were allowed to go out into the town and we were picked up i was picked up with two petty officers that of the royal navy by a family by the name of glove the father of this family was responsible for the electrification of the london underground in whenever it was and they entertained us for the day and took us out and round that's wonderful isn't it yeah did you go up table mountain no i don't think we i can't remember anything about it all i can remember i say it's funny i can remember they lived in kei apple road it's funny how some of these things coming back they lived in kei apple road in cape town because after i got home after being prisoner of war i wrote to them and i got a smashing letter back from them that's nice and then cape town you went on to sri lanka is that right yes we went onto colombo can't remember much about that but a now where did repulse go we went into colombo and i can't remember where the repulse went to then we joined up together and steamed down to singapore what was it like do you remember now that you know obviously you were into the southern hemisphere you've gone through the equator did you do anything when you crossed the equator oh yes in fact i think there's a photograph i've got there's a book if you want any more information if you can ever get hold of it there's a little thin book called one year of life' and it was written by one of the lieutenants his father was the gunnery commander and he was a lieutenant and it's called one year of life' it's got photographs and that in it but oh yes we had the crossing the line ceremony i was fortunate i didn't get dumped i mean there's only a certain length of time that you can carry out a thing like that during the day and they dumped about twenty chaps king neptune lard and plastered the individual and then dumped in a great big tank and that it was quite fun that
