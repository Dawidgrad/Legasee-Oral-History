my name is harry card my age is eighty six joined the navy when i was seventeen how can i say it i've had one two three three ships and came out in forty six forty seven nineteen forty seven had three or four glorious years tell me a bit about how you found yourself in the royal navy how i found myself well my whole family are army and i went to join the army first of all and at the time they were recruiting people i don't know now but after when you think about it they were recruiting people for the second front but i was of an age where i can i say sixteen i wanted to join so i went over to the recruiting office shall we say at croydon went to croydon looked in the door went to the fella i want to join up blah blah blah so he said no you're not old enough go back go back on the job you're doing i can't take you so went out again and as i was going out a chief po petty officer of the navy says what's up i said he won't take us i'm not old enough so he said how old are you i told him me age so he said i'll take you so he said go out and come back in again so went out by that time the sergeant that told us we couldn't he'd gone into the backroom and they weren't allowed to pinch one another's recruits anyway took all our particulars and everything and back home i go so i thought to myself now i got to get my father sign me going in the navy i know he won't sign me going in the navy so when the fella said to me about get your parents to sign well i can't get my dad to sign i've got no dad i've only got a mum cause i knew i could get her to sign and so fair enough he's put that down so that when i got the letter back from them for them to sign i got my mum sign this ticket she said your dad will go mad your dad will go mad well i don't give two monkeys if you don't sign it then i'm going to sign it so she signed it i sent it away so now i got a position now where i'm doing a job i'm a lathe turner and i'm doing what they call a how can i tell you reserved occupation because i was doing war work my first job going was a making electrical my mother put me into electrics first of all and i was making spirals and that for aircraft helmets and gloves heated gloves and that sort of thing and i progressed from that onto milling machine welding and all that sort of thing and then i finished up on the lathe well i was a i say it myself i was a key person you know doing a very productive job and they reserved occupation so they wouldn't want to take me into the forces so i told them i was just an ordinary labourer just sweeping up so now i got to get hold of the production manager to sign my paper as well to say what i was going to say anyway i knew i could get him to sign cause i used to go out ferreting i used to carry his ferrets when he went hunting and that on days on because i was night shift i used to go ferreting with him i said well blah blah blah you got to sign me ticket tell them i'm the bloke that just sweeps up not the bloke that works the lathe i worked the biggest lathe in the shop so anyway alright alright alright i'll sign it he signs it and away i go within six weeks bang they got me in the navy jack the lad ain't i i'm in the navy when i told my father he went potty why was he so anti navy well my family dates back to eighteen something like crimea all army army army army army and he was army an all he had four brothers that were army all in the army but no naval i was the odd man out my brother was long range desert group my brother was so he had quite a character what was sort of the next stage for you next stage was training i got a warrant and all the rest of it going down to collingwood h m s collingwood at fareham hants down there i go six weeks training there as a boy boy seaman first class went in as and i thought jack the lad alright but i used to have to get up half an hour couldn't make that out i used to get up half hour before anybody else because i was a boy i was on such good money i couldn't believe the money i was on i was on seventeen and six a week not like the normal soldier was at a shilling a day i was seventeen and six a week but i had to send seven shillings to my mother and ten shillings i used to get half a crown out the ten shillings left and seven and six they used to save for me it was in my pay book written in my pay book that they were saving that for me and i didn't have access to it at all that was in the bank for me because i was a boy so all the other lads that were getting full pay they used to take me out so i was quid's in wasn't i but being naval it was that way an all you did all work together they taught me seamanship rowing sailing i did manage to get tried out every week you used to run and try to be button boy you know on the mast you know the mast you stand one side of the playground one class every year and you had to run across the playground up the mast and the first one to reach the top you used be able to get a bar of chocolate or something out of the naffi for nothing you know you used to just a prize for being top one you used to fight like shit to get up there but did you ever get up there were you ever first i used to get near it but it was always someone a little bit faster than me but i used to try i used to stand on their fingers as they used to get by me but i don't know if you've seen a mast seen them to get the button boy at the top but one ambition to be a button boy but i could never get there i'd get near it but i couldn't get that last run up that narrow ladder where were you living before you went training had you been on the water had you sailed had you rowed no i hadn't sailed before that could swim that's one thing i could do i could swim but never been on the water at all lived well inland but no i think never even been on woolwich ferry so no i didn't know nothing about boats or anything like that but didn't take me long how long was the training and where next when did you get your first ship and what was that i got a ship come out done my training come out and went to a camp called under canvas at stockheath just outside of portsmouth and it was like a transit camp and from there i went to barracks royal naval barracks at portsmouth for a fortnight there and a week down in the barracks and when i was in the barracks i thought to myself i got it made here get myself a little number and all that sort of thing somewhere quite probably on the gosport ferry or something like that but anyway next thing i knew called my name out over the tannoy voice said harry card report to the drafting office i reported to the drafting office and they give me a draft draft ticket go to a ship go to a ship over in the isle of white a new ship blah blah blah h m s swift so went over there and she'd just been built just doing her running up trials do the trials in the solent and that doing her speed trials and she was then going up to skapa flow to join the fleet so i thought got it made here but prior to that what they given me when i was in barracks was a load of tropical gear which was a pith helmet i always remember it a pith helmet shorts and a white duck suit an everything like that for going out foreign well i thought i was going foreign when they told me well i was going up north and when i got up north i thought to myself there going out to the far east or somewhere like that did they the first thing i had was russian convoy that was my first introduction to what it was all about what year was this in and what was it like seeing the swift it was just shall we say the end of forty three just before christmas when we commissioned the ship we had no christmas leave onboard the ship we were all the time no such thing as christmas leave or anything like that we was getting ready to sail and taking different stores on and things like that and all this sort of thing i thought to myself when they said to me like your jobs going to be lookout your portside forehead lookout you so i said where's that he said on the bridge right by the bridge which it was right on the bridge on the bridge so i thought to myself blimey i can see everything an all didn't i realise you used to cop the weather all the time you know mate and you couldn't do no more than an hour up there at the most you know you had to come out thaw out a bit then go back up keep on that's how i used to do it but so there used to be four of us doing it all the time you know rotating it but just going back a bit harry i mean you've come from a you know a landlubber if you like you're an army family you've done a bit of training you've done a bit of sailing a bit of rowing but i mean how did you feel when you first saw the swift and you thought my god this is a new ship as well it must have been magnificent i couldn't think to be honest when i first looked at it all iron you know you don't realise you know it's something that you just fall in line with i didn't have no apprehension about doing it like if he told me to do it i'd do it cause been indoctrinated like to do it to do it and complain afterwards do it and complain afterwards do you understand what i'm does that mean much to you i don't know if it means but i don't know i didn't think about that to be honest with you it was just there it was all there all jammed into a say about a room half this size well say two thirds of this room say two thirds of this room and there's ten of you in there ten of you and you got to eat sleep and drink in there we had to you know everything's got to be happening in that area and you got another lot the other side the because the gun turret used to come down through the centre of the mess and then you got the other half the other side of the ship that there another ten there and then there's another ten just in front of that then there's the paint locker you know everything's so jammed and packed in then just below you you've got the stokers mess and every now and again you got a head poke up through there you know be the stokers coming through something like that or going down through to the magazine down to the stores and all that it's never private or nothing it's everybody's there like you know just there it's just you had one or two that bill thorpe as i said before he was one of the few that had what we call sea time you know he'd been in a couple of years so he sort of more or less looked after everybody like if you understand what i mean not everybody but you had about out of a ships company about two hundred odd you had shall we say seventy of them were old times like you know we even had a three badger there you know three badge man done twenty one year's yeah but it was a new ship a new ship a new company and new skipper and it was his first command and what a lovely man he was i don't half miss him i was in touch with him near enough once a month right up until he died which was a few couple of year ago but got letters from him now always knew he was getting ill because the last one i got from him was harry he said i'm getting a very weak man i'm getting very very weak and poor sod died didn't he now often i used to go up to when he was commander at greenwich often i used to go up there and a bit of lunch with him he used to take us out to a pub never drink himself but you could have a drink so alright just going back a little bit you've obviously you've been assigned your lookout portside and you sail out of the isle of white and your heading up around the british isles do you remember did you go east or west no well first of all went up through the irish channel up through that way right up through that way and then into greenoch we went into greenoch and oiled came out of greenoch then went to scapa flow scapa flows like the end of the world the arsehole nothing else but sheep and well i think they tell me there's people living on there but i only ever got to one place called right well it started with an l anyway there was only a few people living on the island but scapa flow was scapa flow an all but just a landlocked sort of harbour were you ever bombed up there where you ever attacked was there every any we never got attacked out there until we got to from shall we say just of a greenland then we started to get cause we used to go up we used to come out of loch ewe near falkirk and that way near that way and come out of there and then used to rendezvous just off greenland near the faroe islands and pick up the convoys coming from north america cross the western approaches they used to rendezvous there we used to all congregate the one lot half of them used to go down to liverpool and the other half used to come up and sail up to archangel and kola kola bay and we used to convoy them through and i had got into an era at the time when the destroyers were given it before that the pour buggers that used to help were in trawlers and you know all sort of half and half you know and didn't have very little chance what do you remember of the first convoy first convoy was very uneventful we only lost one ship one boat the mahratta a destroyer that was only seventeen saved off of that did you see it actually happen i didn't see it but i heard it you know you heard it but up there it was either all dark or all daylight it was so off and on you know periods of time so uncanny up there most of the sinking's are all done on the surface if you can understand what i mean everybody gets the idea a submarine looking through a periscope and all that they do quite a bit of that but best part of it was done on the surface because it was too rough to do the periscope because by the time they stuck the periscope up cause you get a trough there about twenty foot thirty foot deep and if you get a sub you know poking it you couldn't see nothing anyway but most what they used to do used to get ahead of the convoy you to somehow know i don't know how they used to know but know you were coming and you'd have ten maybe ten or they have been known up to thirty but i've never known it to be that many but at least ten and they be spaced out and they'd submerge and then as the convoy come as soon as the convoy come they surface fire the torpedoes and drop down again but when they used to what they used to how walker did it apparently that's how i thought he did was when the convoy gone by he always had a destroyer or two destroyers aft aft of the convoy the convoy could be twenty miles long and when they surfaced he used to be there he'd be ten mile behind then and with our radar you could sweep the radar and you could pick them up and then he would direct another ship in to them so he's pinging he's pinging cause when the asdics hits a side of a submarine it's like have you ever chucked a stone in a pond and you get the ripples going out well that's the same thing as asdics asdics anti submarine it the ripples go out hit thing and the ripples return and it's the return that comes back so ping bonk ping bonk and that's how they pick up the sound and he was very successful at it that's when they started signalling when i joined up when most of the shouting and fighting was done just thinking about the first convoy when they i forget the name of the ship that went down how did you feel the mahratta yes the mahratta how did you feel when you found out that you know your now in a situation its gone beyond training its gone beyond fun on a ship its life or death did that effect you well i never felt it at the time no i'm not being blase but i never felt it but i just accepted it to be i've had i had it what they call traumatic i had that after i get that well got that right up to about fifteen twenty years ago i'd wake up sweating and tensed up yes i do that cos i had been tense so after the mahratta did you go into kola after that pardon did you actually sail into kola oh yes we went right into kola yes what was kola like for you the first time you went out i mean that must have been made going from landlocked kent to russia well you was chased literally subs used to go right into the bay you know right kola bay used to literally come right in the bay to you the only place you felt a bit safer was murmansk because murmansk is more a fissure narrower causeway i don't know if you've ever seen her but we never went ashore there i never went we never ashore there you couldn't get ashore they wouldn't let you ashore i think the black prince she some of their lads went ashore and they were fired upon you know and the russians i mean they didn't realise that we were helping them in any way though because we was just a foreigner to them as well and i don't know if you've seen some of their ships there a lot better now i know but if you seen some of them you'd think how the fucking hell do you go to sea in them a proper rag tail bob tail things there you go so that was your first convoy and you got in fairly unscathed tell me about the next convoy next convoy was i think it was fifty six b or fifty seven i'm not quite sure but anyway there all numbered but that was fairly uneventful in as much we only lost the keppel i think it was lost one ship but that time twice i think we got attacked by the nat torpedo i don't know if it's a torpedo they fire from a distance off and it's got a homing device on it and it homes in on your propeller the turbulence you make with the propeller homes in on that well i don't know if it was our skippers idea but the idea was turn towards it reduce the speed to under seven knots well and then you're supposed to trail a box behind you that makes a noise well our bloke he had a different idea his idea was steam towards it but don't de rev steam towards it and get a wire what we call a wire what we tie up with and he'd hang that out the back with a fender on it that would make a noise and he's towing that and he's towing that about twenty odd knots he's towing that making a noise now he's getting the echo coming back each time with the torpedo which is homing in on that noise it's coming towards us now as it's coming towards us he's got to judge the speed of the thing the speed of his ship and when he's got to turn and when he turns he says hard to starboard hard to port whichever the case may be the ship turns and as it turns it drops a depth charge so on a shallow setting so that the torpedo homes in on the depth charge bang goes up the depth charge and the torpedo at the same time that's a bit hair raising and that's what your skipper was doing that's what he was doing yeah and was it successful or obviously you didn't get hit he was successful yeah he was clever at it he was clever he was clever good job he was but no it submarine warfare up there was funny very funny you know it was they couldn't stay on the surface to long cause they used to ice up but we used to ice up and that used to be a problem a big problem at all because it top heavy with all our radar gear and all that used to get and that used to jam all our radar gear up couldn't swing with it so they used to do it electronically then like a scan that used to fly but the weight when the weights on the top say you get about eight or nine ton of ice on a mast and it keels over and the ship slow speed of the ship and it starts just like a pendulum gets it so far gets faster and faster each time it gets faster it gets further over and it has been known for them to turn turtle with the smaller ships you would turn turtle we had what he used to do was let it go so far then used to thrust forward so it slewed the ship and brought it back upright and that's how it used to be we used to do three hours on four hours on and four hours off from the time you left the harbour to the time you come back when you get the weather up there and the daylight sometimes you'd be sailing along and all of a sudden it be black pitch black then five minute later it be like daylight daylight again and that would go on not for one hour or two hours all night and day so you didn't know if it was twelve o'clock at midnight or twelve o'clock midday you with me it's very uncanny very disorientating you know you don't know whether your punched or bored you know did you get were you scared up there scared i don't know scared it was a bit apprehensive but i'm not being brave or nothing but you just didn't think if you understand what i mean it just didn't register as i said to you before it the things the ship had done or did you know i mean there's am operation called tungsten that was where we had to go pick the fleet air arm pilots that were downed on the attack in the scharnhorst we had to go right into in the harbour right in and that was well that was a bit hair raising but don't know did you see the scharnhorst no we never see it i never seen her no i know she was there though because they bombed it you know but we never get that far never got that far in but we had to go one time we went there and were going in there and the destroyer blyskawica polish one that was in front of us and then the the svener we were going in what we had the idea was we all go in and you could only turn one ship at a time so you sort of first one went in turn and come out second one turn and come out so when your all when the five of you are all in line you come out and you fire well what happened was the blyskawica she was the fourth ship we was the fifth ship fourth ship she went down in turned started coming out as she was coming out she was firing cause we got to go in and turn and that's when my little back end went tweet tweet tweet because they started throwing some shit over oh dear and we got to go in and turn and there we are fucking about excuse the language turning trying to turn and that assholes half way out right out of it they'd gone was there any near hits did the ship get hit or was it all no well lucky we were lucky cause way he manoeuvred her in there was unbelievable you know the speed of it the speed of the ship was unbelievable to be honest with you she was a very fast ship when it could do thirty seven knots going astern you understand what i mean yeah unbelievable it is just thirty odd a good thirty knots she'd do going astern she'd go so fast that the water would come over and that's what you had to be frightened off when she did her trials she did her speed trial forty two point eight was her speed she could do she was over two thousand tons imagine that flying through the water about fifty odd mile per hour what a sensation it is because we used to have some fun then when you did any fast steaming when you come into harbour or come alongside a jetty or anything alongside a jetty and you through heaving line make sure the heaving lines wet cause they stack it onboard as soon as he grabbed the heaving line you used to get such a wack on it and he used to but the navy degaussing gear line that used to take a lot of it out but i've had some you know when its not been up to scratch you know cause you have to go in to have it degaussed like they put a current through it and demagnetise the ship but sometimes when you've been steaming fair and far the ship was live with static you know with all the machinery going and everything and as soon as they thrown the heaving line over bang you got a crack from it i don't know if you've had a crack of it but its quite a crack i can assure you so the guys on the jetty you'd throw it to them and you used to make sure it was wet the officer used to look at you and say what have you done again he used to look at tell me about the story about the submarine stubborn what you did there we was at scapa flow just finishing a boiler clean between a convoy and skipper got a message that a sub was in trouble the stubborn two of them were in trouble stubborn and another one and could we go and find them help them if necessary tow them back or take the crew off or whatever the case maybe so we find them but we broke wt silence to do it and found them and took some of the crew off some of them wanted to come onboard and those we left onboard there we started towing them well you know the skipper were not used to towing are we or anything like that so were towing him so the old signal came back fuck sake ease it down ease it down he said jerry couldn't sink us but you will we was towing them to fast so the wash was going and it was going into the conning tower can you follow what i'm saying we was towing them to fast so anyway he eased it down eased it down anyway we were afraid of the aircraft coming from t we broke wt silence to find it and we found it and were towing it anyway there's a picture in there we towed it right up as far as skapa flow and then a tug came out and took her in and took into back into to invergordon but we saved it anyway we got it we couldn't save the other one the other one we couldn't find it we just lost it but we got that one did the crew of that come onboard no they never well some of them did cause some of them were damaged and that and we had two or three of them onboard but mainly they all stayed aboard their own ship you know aboard their own but they got them back anyway i said to them right tow start the engine i don't know what we was doing but we was doing a run down cause we used to do several sorties looking for things running for we was coming down the irish coast and picked up a sub ping pong cause the asdics going all the time and picked up an echo homed in on it bom bom bom sunk it and another time one of them one of the times was up in i know i'm going back a bit the submarine that fired nat torpedo at him it nearly got him he misjudged it a bit and it nearly got us and he went out of his mind to find out which one it was i think it was u nine one one and he made it his duty to go to the people like and find out what happened to it and it was scrapped so he marked it down to himself that that had been sunk as well but it nearly got us that one did when you sunk the sub was there any signs of life no you don't see much sign of it that's what i'm saying to you but you see oil and you see debris but you very seldom see bodies cause with the depth of them when the water rushes in they you know it's like aircraft you know when you decompress it unbelievable it is no i wouldn't fancy the death anyway it's instantaneous i would think but no we never only picked the only thing we could pick up was some debris of it which you have to confirm were there any occasions when you were on certainly on the convoys where you were caught in mountainous seas and you know do you have any recollection of them quite a lot it's unbelievable them seas i mean you be going along like seas were so mountainous and the convoy could be slow so slow you'll be pitching and tossing you're doing about eight or nine knots you know so you start zig zagging when your zig zagging you can increase it twice the amount because your off at an angle come back at an angle that ain't so bad but when i say to you you're on top of the wave and then you're in the trough and when you look you got water all the way around you you with me and then all of a sudden she dips and she comes up and then you think to yourself never gonna come up if you ever got a plate or cup and pushed it down in water when it tries to the ship does that trying to get back up can you follow what i'm saying and you feel her doing this and getting back and all of a sudden she breaks like a duck coming out of water and you think done it again and then she dived back down again you got water all around you again it's unbelievable and you get i know you'll laugh when i say it but you get puss of peas all that floating about deck water on the deck all the time now when you're at sea and you get rough weather and with the stress and strain she'll take water she will take a certain amount of water and they have pumps going all the time pumping it out but it's unbelievable i tell you a rough sea and you think to yourself it's never going to come out of it bang it is bang comes up then another time it's not too bad but then you get when your north because we used to get about a hundred miles north of bear island that's well up right up in the arctic you got the ice one side of you and you've got the sea this side can you understand what i mean so you've only got to contend with them one way and your there she dips in spray comes over the time the spray hits you its ice now that's cold you understand what i mean really cold and it gets all around your face and course me being forehead lookout i used to cop it all didn't i used to think to myself hurry up get out of it and i looked on the later ship that went up there and they had a heated coil at the bottom of their feet but i wish i had one up there because never used to have no heated coil like that must have been you know minus twenty minus thirty thirty five forty incredibly cold it unbelievable if when you touched anything it burnt you if you can understand what i mean literally burn you know your hand would stick to it like a burn how did you keep you know all the sort of the masts and the top end of the ship de iced one of them had a brilliant idea he had they had a steam hose got a hose pipe blocked one end like a hose pipe canvas hose pipe and you wrapped that round the most important parts at the top then you used to pressurise it and when the ice collected all around it you used to pressurise it blow it up and use to break all the ice and the ice used to drop off you used to have to do that probably every two hours or three hours but you'd do it repeat it you beat the bulk of it you follow what i'm saying clever that was otherwise you used to have to get up there and chip it off but it was just one of the stokers ideas you know clever but otherwise you used to three hours two hours three hours four hours on four hours off an hour of that off you used to have to be chipping ice so you only had three hours off take an hour to thaw out you only had two do you remember be constantly tired well you was always tired but i know but i don't know you managed somehow or other i can't i can't describe it i've never i can't but were not as streetwise then as what we are today to be honest with you i don't think so we were just a load of dumb hairy arsed matlos and if he skipper said jump you jumped no two ways about it he was it he was the man but he was a good one though was a good one what happened after the convoys when did you know there was a change of scenery coming and what how did you know about d day and what was going on there then well we didn't know it all i knew about d day we come back we were running convoys right up to about a month before hand doing convoys we did five runs anyway so then we come off of that and were doing bombarding at in around falkirk in scotland anyway just by by cor blimey anyway it was very similar to france then we went down to greenock and started ammunition up and i thought then thought you know ammunition up were putting ammunition in the gangway like you know the gangway of the ship like in the ship and there was all these boxes of four four shells greys fuse what we call greys fuse just like a copper cap on the top and a that was i'll tell you about that later on but that was all up through the lot the gangway right by the canteen right by the tiers both sides of the ship fuck me if hit bosh i'll show you a photograph of a ship that's got hit with it the svener there's a photograph over there of her and then we sail we come out of greenoch everybody's cheering us i thought to myself cheering cheering you know cause he won't tell you nothing not till your right out so you can't fuck off like but he'd get down going down and clears lower deck blah blah blah going on this side then the next like when we supposed to got half way down to ireland turn back go back got to go back went back it was postponed so postponed he's so we went back in so back into harbour again and refuelled again turned round said right we sailed next day so we went back out again out we went got down to right down there and just before we got to there he told us right this is it today were going to be all this will be a great day in history and all the old rabbit and all the rest of it letter from eisenhower and gave us some french money i don't know why they gave well they didn't give it to us but it was there but we could have it french money like the money funny money for going ashore if we had to go ashore anyway down we go and when i woke up in the morning when i looked out in the morning i see all them ships i thought crikey i've never seen anything like it in my life you know well you don't can you imagine five thousand ships going round and round and round and your there and all he's trying to do is get to the front so which he is you know it's like piccadilly circus you know he's weaving in and out in and out he's getting and he's working his way to the front picks up to some minesweepers there in front of us so going in going in there sweeping then they turn off so when they turn off i think to myself oh this is it sort of thing you think to yourself what's going on now i'm forehead lookout i'm right in the front watching it everything that was going on i can see everything and i could see him up there skipper up there you know and he you've got to report to him with like you know you shout you shout and he's he can hear you or the officers on the bridge can hear you anyway you're going in and then this is about what five o'clock going well in sweepers had gone back how far from shore are you i'd say roughly were we are when i'm telling you now when the sweepers turned off i'd say ten mile twelve mile it's not far at sea cos you it's unbelievable you can see you know the horizon on the ship is about twenty mile away you know that don't you that you can see and about fifteen mile we were going in and going in and then i'll show you that photograph of her in that book and you can see the shells going up as they were tapering off they'd gone off because she got blew right torpedo hit right at midship bang right at midship we're heading in the minesweepers had gone are you accompanying a ship here then or no the ships are behind us all the fleet everybody's behind us were the people there going to lose first of all you understand what i mean were the people were going in were the probe put it that way to you because they wouldn't send a big battlewagon in there or a cruiser in there send the rowing boat in that's us in we go and two e boats come out of le havre i see them come out picked them up on radar an all they fired at the warspite fired at the warspite every ship in the fleet i should think fired at them missed them they turned and as they turned they fired and the torpedoes four of them come around around around three of them had run out well two of them had run out three of them had run out one of them is still sailing on long it came around around as it's running out in losing its speed it's coming up its come round i watched it come round bang it hit the svenner wack right at midships up she's gone so i thought to myself wo fucking hell so what he's done he's immediately thought of all the lads in the water and that all swimming about and all and he's got ten minutes to spare so what does he do he radios largs that's the capital ship like one of the ships were the commander in all the admirals and all the rest of it could he stop and pick up survivors they said no carry on to your allotted position they wanted us to go in you know which we did an all but he was ten minutes early so what he did he reduced speed of the engine and the tide took the brought the survivors and the survivors come down and you just chucked scrabbling nets over the side and hooked them in eighty nine he took on board eighty nine and then still carried on with eighty nine still on board so some were wounded some were not all in the aft mess decks and that out the way in we go and i thought to myself they must of heard us coming now and nothing else so still this is about half past five slew round slewed round and i thought to myself slew round and i say alright let go of the anchor let go of the anchor and the noise that fucking thing makes when it goes down i thought to myself they got to hear us you know nothing nobody heard nothing still and he's saying to i can hear him saying gus how many guns can you get to bear now only three sir come astern come astern come stern come astern come stern come astern go ahead come astern go on and he manoeuvred that ship off that anchor so that she got then the guns said all guns to bear sir right o and then the next thing he says and this is about ten minutes afterwards open fire wallop bang away we went and i thought to myself now there bound to hear us and all of a sudden yes he did and i thought to myself i ducked and no good me ducking anyway i ducked and i just waited then and he said to me report any flashes you see well you couldn't report any flashes because they was using flash fuel you'll see smoke so you kept your eye open for that well i did see a couple of flashes on a what i thought was a water tank but it turned out to be there was a fort out there like a tower it's still there now and we straddled that a couple of times and i couldn't make out why it never fell over but it was painted on the side of it like a tower like a water tower and i couldn't make out why i don't know why about twenty foot of concrete and bash we hit it a couple of times but didn't make no impression on it like throwing peanuts at it but it never fired no more after we hit it so i suppose they thought better of it but the only thing that bothered us was an eighty eight and that used to come out the side of the side of the mountain like the hill used to fire wallop and go back in made a pepper pot of our funnel but straddled us every time bam bam bam straddled us every time but we got it in the end so it was a good two days three days afterwards we got it but d day wasn't too bad i thought it was quite good what was it like for you to see a ship take a direct hit that close i mean that must of been a bit of a terrifying experience wasn't it well it is but you think immediately for the poor sods that's in it i know it sounds a bit old hat but even if it was there ship you think of the poor sods that's in it you know obvious your obvious thoughts at the time i don't know why but obvious thought is to try and pick them up even the subs you sink i mean alright i know this that and the other you hear a lot of tales but if you see a fella in the water you pick him up i don't give a sod what you say but that it's just in you to do it you'd do it i know you would but any of you know it's human nature tell me a bit about your skipper and the decision he made to slow down and pick up those guys and what you thought of him skipper well he never made a everybody else like in his class two or three of them in his class cause made admiral and he never he had some good jobs an all that sort of thing but he made commander and but captain like four rings but he never made what he should be i myself personally because he broke the golden rule he they said to him don't pick up the survivors you carry on to your position and he knew he was ten minutes early but he held back and picked up he said i'm too much of a humanitarian and he actually said that i was too much of a humanitarian and he radioed that back to them that he was too much of a humanitarian he could not go by the men he had to pick them up and that's the reason i don't think he ever made any further than what he did get like he got as far as he got promoted and that sort of thing got the dso and all the rest of it he got quite you know he got promoted and all that sort of thing but i don't think he got his he was a gentleman though a real gentleman and i'll tell you that lieutenant commander gower he was his nephew was the cricketer gower david david yeah cricketer yeah how did you feel as part of the ship's crew to know that your skipper had made that call you know i mean what sort of pride do you have for somebody like that he made the call it was well you know you expected it of him to be honest with you it was him you would i mean he'd could never of lived it down himself with his crew even surly but you just couldn't go by people i don't care who it was in the water you couldn't go by them just to recap again on how what it must of been like to be onboard a ship when everything opens up i mean what kind of i'm still deaf in that ear now with it but they won't have it but i'm deaf in that ear with it because it was there bang it used to fire and i used put the duffle coat over but it didn't so but i am deaf in it when they fire with a full charge as well it's something to be on but the most gratifying thing of all though to be honest with you is when you get the big ones behind you open up you know your opening up with your pea shooter in a sense like a little catapult and then you get these four big ton weight they are a ton going over they stand about five foot high don't they and you can actually see them go over you know you can see the fire behind them four balls of fire behind them as there going over and it ain't half gratifying i say what there like on the receiving end fucked if i know but you feel so pleased an all to see them going over and then rocket ships oh they were another one over a thousand rockets going out imagine them and their equivalent to a six inch shell that's gratifying an all and they don't fire all at once they fire in like banks of ten you know go up i think it's banks of ten i know but i know it's in banks they fire them one at a time the fella is in an asbestos suit in the middle in a like a cocoon sort of thing and he's firing them as he's pressing the button fire one bom bom and it's supposed to clear a square mile unbelievable it is when you see them go off i tell you what it's some d day was to me was something i shall well i shall never forget it what a wonderful thing how it was even worked you know the thought it just didn't happen it must of taken years of planning the planning must of started as soon as it all happened if you understand what i mean and that ramsey ahh what a man he is what a man he is he must of cause he was behind everything no he was to me when you think about it well and them soldiers some of them some of them walked ashore some of them had to but majority of them how they got ashore got ashore light you know i think myself because you they were waiting for something else i don't know but to me they never they didn't seem half half the what i expected you understand what i mean i expected a lot more so as our skipper says d day was like a walk in the park to what we just been through with are russian convoys and a couple of jaunts in the fields in one thing or another which you did and end of story the initial invasion you were there right at the front almost we was at the front yeah that was absolutely incredible but we were the first ship the first ship to open fire we was all supposed to open fire there was about five or six destroyers i suppose strewn along that front and that was there orders cause they were sent in because they were sent in that close we was as close as two mile three mile i could see the cars going up and down i could you know and i could see people that's how close i was so how he never fucking see us i don't know what was the next big event for the swift i guess it was the sinking talk a bit about how that came about what you done after d day what we did after d day all we had to do d day was bombarding bombarding and well the next day for us they allowed us that night they allowed us to go back to portsmouth to take the wounded and the survivors back to depot down at portsmouth and unload them at the same time refuel and re ammunition more fucking ammunition because we got rid of all what we had you know that was gone and this was at well we left there about i suppose six o'clock i know at eleven o'clock we was oiling ship and ammunition ship at eleven o'clock at night and i did get a nice kip that night to be honest i know some of the lads had to work and the next thing you know we was we sailed about half past two three o'clock next thing i know we was over in normandy back in normandy half past four five o'clock in the morning shelling again and then that was all right for about five or six days we was doing a bit of shelling and of a night time we used to have to go out because the e boats and the u boats used come out then and try and penetrate the ships that are the invasion ships that are there and hospital ships and lsts and all that they used to try we used to have to set up a screen then right around patrol we had one or two goes at them you know but know body ever got hurt we never hit them and they never hit us so i don't know but i could never make that out because we was well and truly established you know it everything sort of clicks in then and everything sort of comes in and we lasted until the twenty third twenty fourth twenty fourth she was sunk what was that you was on ship were you yep i was on the ship there she is up there that's her in half what happened we'd been out chasing a couple of e boats and one thing and another chased them back into la havre and were coming back in to reammunition take some more ammunition we were low we were going to take some of the scourge and she was in front of us well were coming in and as were coming in overnight they dropped oyster mines there mines that lay on the bottom got no wires or nothing like that but as soon as a ship passes over them the pressure between the ship and the mine activates the mine and the mine opens up sets the mechanism working magnetism comes up homes in on the engine room course were in shallow water comes up cops us right at midships and blew us right in half i've got photographs of her over there i was just i just come off of watch and i was down in the mess deck coming along the gangway right by the ts and that by the compass room coming along i was going into the washroom and bang i felt this bump i felt the bump then i felt a lift and then the bang you understand what i mean as it came up and i could imagine myself going up and coming back down again my legs twisted underneath me and then about eight or nine blokes come down on top of me as she's dipped and they've all slid down because there in the passageway an all then i thought to myself well i got to get out of here i got all these blokes and it's not about women and kids first you're fighting your fucking way out get out you know get off get off i've got up and i've got the door open got the clips on the door swung the door and as i've swung the door open the waters just coming up to there and all the other blokes coming behind me get out so we got out i got out onto the deck up the ladder onto the onto the foc'sle stand on the foc'sle skippers up on the bridge load of others all come out on the forehead end all come out all standing on the deck waiting to go the boiler boats you got no chance that's twenty foot of the deck went there they'd gone they are it hit right underneath the boilers the boilers blew as well you see at same time cause we just been steaming and they were right pressure an all when the cold water hit them and they just simply exploded so poor they had no chance and a she started settling and he's getting the lookouts on the bridge where i just come off the binoculars had gone through the back of their heads and he'd took all them out took the lads out a put them in the compass room like a chart room there on the bridge and locked them in there and then got some other papers on what you got to give out and then he said abandon ship i will silly little comment thing we met him a few weeks well a few years afterwards and we was at greenwich i'll always remember it at greenwich commander gower and he's there in civvies and were there in civvies met him there and he says to bill bill thorpe my mate by the way thorpe he said who gave you permission to leave the ship when she got hit cause he got blew of the bridge he was on the bridge and got blew off the bridge and straight on the oilcan on the after part floating away because he left the ship didn't he he said who gave you permission to leave the ship you know quite jokingly like but because some of them didn't even get their boots wet but i know i was that was frightening for me i'll tell you now i was frightened and you'll never believe when the water started lapping around my feet my first things to come off was my sea boots they came off so i thought to myself hurry up i'm getting my feet wet abandon ship i'm going in the drink got my boots and everything off i got them off i'm ready to go ain't i i put my overalls back up button them up i've slung me toilet gear had my toilet gear i slung that and the towel i slung and i'm looking up and he said abandon ship as soon as he said abandon ship bosh i'm in because i'm thinking off the suction of us settling but little i realised she was only in twelve metres of water like she was sitting on the bottom near enough and that's how she stood and then the two ends just settled down and then she finished disappeared but how did you how did it feel to be looking back at this ship after well i was trying to get as far away from it as possible cause i didn't think i didn't know whether it was going to blow or nothing cause there was depth charges still primed i didn't know whether they cause you got to think of them as well i didn't realise she wasn't in deep enough water but you don't think at the time all you think at the time get away from her swim and i swam this lct him they came by they'd been out collecting fish they had and they came by and they threw me an heaving line and i grabbed hold of the monkeys paw the fist got hold of it and they jerked me still going he's working his way in towards the rest of the lads and i managed to get the other hand round the thing and they pulled me up when they pulled me up what they call the horse pipe pulled me up there and i banged my bloody head on the horse pipe and nearly let go you with me and somebody had hold of my legs and that and they dragged me back in i didn't know where i got it from but i was smothered in oil i don't know where i got it from but i was smothered in oil must of swam in some oil but got me on deck and then the muscles of the leg was twisted i had contusions i had cut on one side and a cut in the back and i'm sitting on there with a bar of chocolate in my hand crying my eyes out and that was i didn't know why i was crying nothing wrong just shock then really come home to me then that was the only time they call it traumatic post traumatic stress yes i suffered with that for years afterwards you know you don't think nothing of it at the time do you then next thing i know i'm on a they put me on a landing craft the took me to the hospital ship hospital ship they cleaned me up put me on a lst over to portsmouth got to portsmouth and i was supposed to go to the left to haslar instead of that i've gone up and they'd two blokes that was carrying me put me on a train next thing i know i'm on my way up north and you'll never dream guess where i stopped first of all cross the road in railway sidings orpington i live orpington just across the road i couldn't get to my mother and father but to them i was missing cause he couldn't account for me the skipper couldn't account for me because he accounted for everybody all those missing like and then he wrote to the families and told them like there missing and all the rest of it and nobody found me till about six weeks afterwards i thought i got away with it i did i thought i was home and dry next thing i know they the officer comes down blah blah blah your name number and all the rest of it oh yes they've been looking for you so i thought oh have they cause they knew i come ashore on the hospital ship i didn't know that but anyway looking for you find out where you'd gone where you got to so they measured me up for my suit and clothes and what have you kit gear and give me a warrant well i had two fractures in this leg and a wound on it and a wound at the back they were all healed up i was jack the lad up there to be honest with you where was it hairmyres hospital in scotland and i up there and trust me again i'd scrounged some trousers shirt jacket some socks some shoes of a nurse she had three brothers and they used to come in and see me and i used to go ashore with them like and the other army blokes used to have to do some work if they could get mobile and all wearing blue uniforms but i wouldn't wear a blue uniform i was aloud i wasn't aloud i was allowed to wear me kit so the sergeant he wasn't having none he phoned greenock and told them i was there next thing i know that officer came aboard what you think he give me give me five pound five pound to me was like a fortune wasn't it course straight on the piss we gone so come the next day he said i've got a warrant for you i thought he said warrant take me to prison of something i got a warrant for you he said no you got to report to barracks at portsmouth he said so i said what about my survivors leave survivors leave he said well you've been six weeks up here he said so i said well yeah let me have this convalescence then so he said alright convalescence he says have a fortnight down there so i had a fortnight down there at the convalescence place give me another tenner this time so fuck me this is well the bloke the army blokes i was with brilliant we was out on the razzle it was brilliant it was anyway cause they didn't have a lot of money anyway because they get low pay anyway we get there and away we go so when i'm there he comes down again this officer with the other parts of me kit me gas mask and all this sort of caper so i thought oh dear oh dear oh dear so got me other suit best suit one thing and another nice pair of shoes i'm away down to portsmouth gets to portsmouth i said to him first thing i say to the officer have you can i have my survivors leave he said no you can't have survivors

cross to trincomalee trincomalee okinawa to herojima up to up to the back down through down through the barrier reef did a plotted a course down through the barrier reef back out again back up to auckland auckland back up to picked up another freighter refuelled the fleet again come back again escort duties all the time you know just escort duties and next thing i knew steam south we had to steam south so were steaming south for about two three days bang they dropped the bomb then two or three days later they dropped another one so i had a good run in my little short capacity put it that way must have been a pleasure to go down to the sort of south pacific and be sailing round there when you were after the arctic convoy ah that was a pleasure that was they used to call me maltese mick the colour of me i used to be brown as a berry yeah ah it was a pleasure i know you're going to laugh but we used to be a rush to get out on deck first thing in the morning to pick up the flying fish they were lovely grilled you know the flying fish used to come inboard you know and buggered it was unbelievable that was i enjoyed every minute of that you didn't see any action though when you went down no no no never well no it was all over near enough when cause that's all i was sent out there for was well escorting we did some escort duties you know the wave emperor wave king i can always remember the tankers they supplied the fleet but when all the fun started we used to piss of back down but some of those poor ships funnily enough i finished up on the indefatigable the carrier doing the troop trooping they dumped all the aircraft off and put all beds in there and brought all the bush brides back too aussie and all the gi brides back to america cor what a on i won't say too much about it no go on so this in when you say picking up the troops of being stuck in singapore and malaya and you're taking them home yeah oh yeah we were taking them well come back to england on the odzani and then thought to myself go on leave again i'm not quite eligible to go out for demob so they want a crew for the carrier and indefatigable to go back out to america take the bush brides back to america so i got lumbered for that job took that lot back to america and then came back over to england again no from america we went to singapore hong kong but i on the odzani by the way i was one of the first ships into hong kong for the relief of hong kong he did see the fellas out from stanley camp you know poor sods there and then changi jail we went well we went to singapore with the lads at changi see all them poor sods there that they couldn't move you know but i could tell you some tales actually with the odzani when we were doing the relief in hong kong and that then we went round to macau portuguese china i had a good run i enjoyed myself i know it's but mind you i think its payment for what we been through put it that way to you it wasn't too bad at all it wasn't too bad at all but what was it like for somebody from kent to be down in the south pacific and going to places like sri lanka and singapore and all these you know just dipping your toes into those mad different cultures and stuff i mean how did you what did you think about it did you get any chance to get on shore oh it was like another world wasn't it to be honest with you you know you don't think about it to be honest with you i didn't think about it but i shall always remember going ashore at singapore when we first went into the harbour there was all this banging and crashing and flashes and cor i thought to myself oh dear who did they pick for shore party joe soap because i'd done the commando training no combat they call it well whale island i'd done that and who gets picked for shore party joe soap so your patrol leader i was patrol leader because i was a second class gunnery rating so i'm a patrol leader so i'm duty carry the hand grenades and all that so were ashore going ashore in the whaler going ashore and i thought oh dear this banging and flashing they must be shooting one another and your little arseholes twitching like that you know and you think to yourself so i thought to myself as soon as the boat touches i'm off i'm on the shore and away soon as it touched i jumped in jumped in and what do i do went up to my neck in water right up here well i couldn't get out with the weight i got on i've got the lanchester ammunition i've got the lanchester strapped round the front of me and i've got the hang grenades in the pouches it was like a lead weight on me i'm shouting at them to pull me back out what we done she'd come in and hit a rock and she still had about four foot to go to get in i jumped in didn't i and i'm up to my neck in water you know and anyway pulled me back out got ashore and the royal marines are ashore there there running the trams all the trams all like running and all that sort of thing so were looking round for something to do went into a warehouse i know you're not supposed to went into a warehouse what's in there load of japanese money what they print themselves you know i had rolls of it like on a bit weren't any value like but rolls of newspaper you know like rolls of paper and all this japanese money like you know all you had to do was cut it up i had some fun with that i bought some of it home for the kids to play with and that and i brought one of their helmets i brought that home i brought some kimonos home and that what you could buy out there you know some of them got i know you're not going to think much of it got married out there for a tin of sardines and that you know the money for a packet of aspirin that was like like heroine that was to them are you with me drugs cause they had no drugs or nothing but anything like that was but was currency cigarettes was currency i used to they used to have one bloke there i won't say no names a they had one girl out there and all they had to do was keep her supplied that was a flat and that come to i think it was three tins of grade three salmon and some cigarettes and what have you and she kept the flat clean cooked for them and all the rest of it whenever they were ashore and cause we used to be get ashore for twenty four hours being watch keepers they had a flat and we used to use the flat just by the fleet club at hong kong always remember that but then we went round to macau that's another one cause our names are on a plaque there where we opened the kids playground what is your overall thought about your time in the navy then in the war my time i'd do it again defiantly do it again defiantly join the navy again i could see no i felt safer i know you may laugh but i felt safer in there than what i would of on land but on land i suppose you got another trip but the only thing about it is put it this way to you if you're out there and you've got an aircraft coming in you he's coming in at you he's not coming in at the bloke in the next field he's coming for you and it makes you more eager pop him or fella down in the deep there trying and the equipment they give us is unbelievable that brilliant that equipment they give us to find them that asdics is something else but cause once that latches on and they tell me i don't know they tell me that asdics they can hear that echo hit the ship hit their side ping it goes it does ping in there you know you hear when you see them in the telly ping bong that's the echo coming back bong ping and it's coming back cause you know electricity travels at the speed it does it's unbelievable and you can once you sit on them and you got about two hundred depth charges you're gonna you're gonna sit on the for ever more you only have to drop a charge and they got to come up did you get any subs did you actually sink any subs i didn't i've been on a boat a sub but i've never sailed on a sub no did you ever sink a sub oh yeah we sunk well officially we did sink defiantly one u when was this then sorry when was this of the coast of ireland what do you think of the state of the navy now well which navy the wrens of the the state of the navy well what do you think about when you see what's going on with the forces ah well it would never wouldn't have done in my time there all officers they don't get no hairy arse scratchers or matlows or anything like that there all officers there's officers for computers officers for radio well we never had them it was all done by the and now it's a career isn't it and to how can i say to you it's the same as how can i say to you national health you don't get a nurse you get a manager and you get where they took on for argument sake eight thousand doctors and forty eight managers forty eight thousand managers you with me it don't work and that's all they i mean it's i mean you got guns on there now fire a three inch shell a hundred and twenty eight rounds a minute you know and it's all automatic me was lucky when we used to when i was gun crew eleven rounds a minute we used to get with a four seven hand ramming you know and run like shit to do it you know all back in you know we go back years tradition the way we do it you know one over one in front and one in the middle up one down two then you got to hit her if you go up one then you drop back two that gives you your short shell then you judge it between the two one in the middle that's fire control what i call fire but today now it's they swing round with the radar bonk crash on that is it what do you remember of the end of the war then back in england what was it like what did you what was your job next well they didn't do nothing just sort of give you a suit and it had like a demob suit mind you i did come out with a nice i come out with about i think about seventy odd pound which was a lot of money were i accrued it from i don't know but i got it i shouldn't of come out to be honest with you i was on good money there i should of stayed in but as the skipper said to me you go out you come out i said yeah i said they let me come out but a i had a choice i had to do another three year or come out so i came out what was it like going back to land life after that adventure land life well we was self supporting even when we was at sea to be honest with you cause we never used to like the army fellas that used to have a cook house we had a cook house yes but we used to have to grub ourselves prepare our own food take it up to the galley and they had to cook it for us and we was allocated money as well and so we were self supporting darn me own socks i even darn them today you know what i mean when you came out it was you know your suddenly fending for yourself or was it easy easy to fend for myself which i did do you know because my mother and father had moved away they were down in they finished up at ashdown forest with the lady norbury and lady estate i went down there but i couldn't have it i came back up to live up in beckingham back up to where i was self supporting again on me own no i've done me taught me a lot the navy quite a bit
