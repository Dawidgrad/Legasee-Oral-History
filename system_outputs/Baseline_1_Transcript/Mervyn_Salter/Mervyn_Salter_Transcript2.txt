what was some of the one can you remember the list of the first few journeys of what you did a did you go to norway quietly on the first trip i took somers was detailed to carry out a anastic sweep whilst accompanying arms queen mary with churchill aboard are on route to a meeting with the roosevelt in quebec or at quebec but to due to a typical atlantic storm gale force winds and mountainous seas we had to call it off after seventeen hours because it was the conditions were so bad and resulted that we limped into saint john's newfoundland four days after queen mary's birth at quebec so some baptism and my first trip to see how were you sea legs a i was i was never sea sick that was one thing i ought always boasted about others never seasick can you describe conditions in those seas well as i say as a biomountainous seas and of the ship would be it up and down mainly he went going into the water and the water would cascade over the top of the bridge and roll down the a over the guns and all the rest of it a what was your you fiction station the time we on or off my watch i was as i say is on an erlicangun which was on a platform a posted just after the after the funnel drily want an alice when in these storms or you'd better as an elite are you thinking i wish i'd to had gone to the airport is never a never what was that we say that we came back from canada and then we were attached with her units of the fleet to carry out a bombardment of installations on the norwegian coast this is our first my first taste of the war as it were and are a on retiring from lately action we were pursued by a enemy aircraft but fortunately they didn't press home they had too too too much so were we escaped unscathed as it were is that the first time you got to fire the alleges i didn't actually fire because the four sevens the bigger guns had kept the aircraft at bay you know but we were close up ready to fire but the my range was only a thousand yards you see so that i say it to though i was close up i didn't actually have to open fire at that at that time what what was it like to be you know although you'd done gunnery training how was it can you mail it felt like to be on board when the ship really opened up in terms of the full bombardment what what was the effect on the ship like it was obviously a loved noise from the from the four sevens and a but really i was a great deal because he was steaming and parry doing twenty twenty plus knots so that you got to did the judge from the the ships firing the big guns firing but as we were closed up of course concentrating on our own efforts didn't take too much notice of this yes so we can after the norwegian trip across a then it was her arctic calm voice
