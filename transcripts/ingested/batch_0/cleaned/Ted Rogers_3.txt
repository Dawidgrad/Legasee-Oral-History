let's talk about the day you were torpedoed what do you remember of that i'll just tell you about it in brief i was on the bridge as one of the lookouts the third mate was in charge the ship at that time because the captain wasn't always on the bridge we had a lookout up the crow's nest high up and just about eleven twenty eleven thirty in the morning on a sunday he shouted torpedoes on the starboard bow i looked there and saw four coming towards us and then the third officer gave a command to steer towards them hard a'starboard because then you present a smaller target but it was too late by the time we were swinging around there you can't do it like that you know it takes a bit of time to get round two hit the ship one went ahead i could see it i was still watch in the bridge the other one came in i thought it was here it was there it had gone right through the ship but actually it was set deep so it went underneath one ahead one underneath and two hit us amidships and the ship went on fire and then the captain gave the order to abandon ship because it was quite hopeless and to go to the lifeboats we had four lifeboats two on each side i went to my lifeboat and there was nothing there it had been blown up in the explosion the two lifeboats on the starboard side were in splinters they had disappeared with the explosion and so i went to the rule was to go to the one on the opposite side of your own i went there and all these people were getting in it and it was being lowered down so i got in that boat and it got stuck on the way down because the ship was heeling over to starboard and it got stuck in between decks and by pushing it and pushing it they freed it but it damaged the boat and when it got down to the water it sank now it was my first trip so i didn't know much about lifeboats so most of us then jumped over the side the captain was going around he let go a number of rafts from the ship and these rafts were the home made type with oil drums and wooden slats on them anyway i swam to one of those along with some other men from the sinking lifeboat anyway they managed to salvage that boat because the air tanks lifted it up a bit and they patched it with canvas and baled it out you see so then we only had one other boat you see the other boat went round circling and picked us up from the life raft and then they managed to get more people in the damaged boat and then the submarine was on the surface taking films and then the third mate remembered he hadn't ditched the secret code books so he tried to get back on board the boat climbing up the ropes and then the submarine machine gunned they didn't try to hit him it was a warning i think so he came down again and then shortly after that the ship wasn't sinking quickly enough for them so they put another torpedo in and then it went up like that and down the shocking moment when you see the ship completely disappear and you're left in a little boat one hundred and twenty miles from shore and then we were over crowded because was made for a capacity of thirty two and because of the damaged boats we had more we had over forty eight and it was sitting like this you know and we had also the second engineer in the boat and he was badly burned the engineer was on fire when he got out and he died the next day we had to put the body over the side and see the sharks coming and then we towed the raft for a couple of days because if you needed exercise you could go on the raft because the boat was so cramped and then the sharks were coming up underneath i remember the boatswain had an axe and he was hitting the sharks anyway after that time we thought well it was dragging us too much too much of a drag on the boat we're not sailing quickly enough because we were sailing and rowing so we let it go and that was another dramatic moment because that was the last line of safety that we had left you know that was on the sunday when we were torpedoed and then on the wednesday we saw sunderland flying boats on some days but they didn't see us and it was very hot the sun was belting down you know one of the crew had got delirium because he got sun stroke i think and he was raving and shouting around it was very difficult and then we were running short of water we only had water tanks water barrels you know and then on the wednesday afternoon one of these old walrus aircraft came and he saw us and they were the old sea planes and the sea was quite calm so he landed near us and asked if anybody was injured and he could take them to hospital but it would have meant putting his pilot his co pilot in our boat as his plane was only a two seater so nobody was badly injured so we said ok' so he gave us a course to steer which we were on already and then he took off and then that evening we saw smoke coming out of a ship coming to pick us up we thought but then there was a tremendous sort of hurricane storm and we had to fight for the boat it was raining as well which meant we had plenty to drink by the time the storm had subsided there was no sign of the boat at all but that night we saw land and we rowed all night but in the morning we didn't see a thing the visibility was very low from the boat and we had been swept around into the bay you see by the current anyway we carried on on our compass because we had a compass direction and that afternoon late afternoon a trawler a naval trawler came out of freetown and picked us up not far outside the harbour it didn't come a long distance actually and then we were taken on shore and there were so many what were called british distressed seamen' there because a lot of ships had been sunk just outside and then we were put on the scythia troop ship i've got a picture of it actually and sent back to england so that was my introduction to the merchant navy and to the war
