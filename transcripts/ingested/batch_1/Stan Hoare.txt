well my name stan hoare my rank was an able seaman i was a radar rating and i was in the service from june nineteen forty three until i was invalided out in february nineteen forty six i was quite happy i was in the scouts i was in the choir and best to my knowledge my recollection i was apparently happy i was thinking about it the other day and i decided i was happy but almost you could say a close knit group i mean the choir boys were mostly in the sixteen th clapham scouts well the cubs and the scouts and that was about it there was three of us went to the same central school they used to have a system where by the age of eleven i believe they do now you sat an exam but in those days in london if you pasted the exam the first two boys that passed the exam went to a grammar school and the next three boys went to a central school it was the only sort of school senior type of school which you couldn't pay to go to you could pay to go to a grammar school but you couldn't central school and the class i was in there was i think about forty eight of us and we came from all different schools to get to that central school i lived at clapham that at south west south london and well my parents lived there we moved there in nineteen twenty six and they lived there until they died in nineteen seventy five we lived upstairs first of all and then the gentleman that owned the house sold it to my father and mum and dad lived in the entire house then well i was fourteen when i was evacuated fifteen when i came home and to me i found it quite exciting probably i shouldn't say that but i went out to work end of november when just about the time they really started blitzing the capital i heard the other day we had seventy four nights of blitz without it stopping and i used to come up at the bank underground station by king william street and gracechurch street where i worked and look up and the only thing that was gone was the windows other buildings had gone but not the building i worked in so i continued to work there until i was called up i was just an office boy then i went in the accounts department and i started to learn accounting which i followed right from the beginning after i came out of the forces i didn't know what to do so i thought well i done a bit of work in an accounts department so i'll go for that and i did try eventually to get a qualification of the i forget it now i forget what it was called now but i didn't pass the second part final so i didn't get it well i can remember some of it i can remember for example i used to do fire watching you weren't supposed to do fire watching until sixteen but i started a bit early and i remember a series of bombs dropping down cannon street it was quite exciting i shouldn't say that really but it was i really i don't remember i can't see very much difference i mean it was if you got i used to travel from the bank underground station to clapham common and we get off there and walked but if you were on a train and the air raid siren sounded it was quite likely they'll shut the gates because there were gates across to stop the underground flooding and they shut those and be stuck in the underground train then but i thought found it looking back on it i find it quite an exciting period of my time i can't say i dislike the war i should say i dislike it but i didn't i got my papers about ten days before i had to go in the navy but i registered actually about six weeks before i was eighteen and when i went in i went to hms raleigh which is down in cornwall and i was called in one day and the to the divisional office and the division officer looked at me and said what do you want i said i was called over the tannoy sir he said oh yes you're the youngest conscript we've ever had here and i just well don't hang around go back and join your unit and that was about all it wasn't bad doing it really i suppose well i had a father that was i was an ho that's hostilities only and my father was an ho in the first world war and i had a grandfather that was a merchant seaman and i just liked the navy i had books about the navy when i was a small child i didn't want to join up for a long time you know they asked me when i went in after about five weeks we all had an exam and we sat at special desks which had our names on and they asked me two or three times if i'd like to be a naval officer and each time i said no what is said the reason one of the reasons i said no is because i knew my parents couldn't afford to keep me and i couldn't live on six bob a day and midshipman would get so i stayed as an ordinary seaman able seaman when i rose to the dizzy heights of able seaman i got four shillings a day plus proficiency pay being a radar rating but looking back on it it wasn't a bad life i went to a few different places i'd of gone to more if i hadn't of been injured when i was in the navy about five miles from windsor we didn't really mix with the cornish people i mean you just mixed with the blokes in training with yourself you did ten weeks basic training as a seaman and at the end half way through it you did this sort of thing an exam and you all sat at separate desks in one of the big rooms and your name was on the desk and the women she was a i can still remember her now second officer wren second officer west and she looked after us and when i finished as usual i don't read instructions until it's too late and i read the instructions because she said to me can't you do the paper hoare so i said oh yes mam but i can't do trigonometry because i only had one lesson of that and then the war started so she said well you're not supposed to finish until twelve and it's only eleven i said well i just worked my way through the paper and that was it and so she let me go outside for a smoke co as she called it but it wasn't bad at raleigh apart from the main assault course and i damn near killed me we had to because i was last out of the group of six i was in i had to run up and down this hill six times and i was nearly dead at the end of it and then i had to get over a wall twelve foot high and these two blokes helped me and they said we'll help you stanie and i'm sure if i'd of stood away from being in between they'd of both fallen over everybody was exhausted at the end of that assault course but from there i went too i had a week's leave and then i went to the isle of man and spent six weeks at the isle of man learning to be a radar rating and learning how to tell what the little echoes were on the screen and that's what i was during the war radar rating i quite enjoyed it how on earth do you work out what the echo is how do you do that well you don't always because sometimes you get the wrong one but you can get an echo a back echo and a side echo you can have four different echoes and you have to pick out one that you think is the biggest echo and i know just after d day i was on watch and i heard the skipper on the phone say come up here you and i said to somebody else he said oh he was on the radar setting and he saw this echo he said he thought it was just ship moving and seemed to be doing two hundred miles and hour going across to bomb somewhere but it was quite exciting what is said i just went along i was called to the drafting office and they said to me your name so i said hoare oh yes he said you're going to hms hart i thought then we were at devonport barracks or if you want a navy term gus barracks and that's where we joined the ship a gus ship and that's it so i become a devonport rating because i was a portsmouth rating before then and you took the rating the ship you was on and i remember going onboard being very proud to be perfectly honest but well it was something i really wanted to do not that i wanted to join up to the navy for twenty odd years but it was very very i liked it that's all i can say well on the hart it didn't take very long because it was a small ship but the next ship i went on was a battleship and there was fourteen hundred odd men on that and you used to wander all over the place actually it was a very good ship for skiving when we joined the hart we went from devonport i can't remember where we joined i think we went up by train to glasgow and joined here from there and then from there we went to lamblash in the islands i don't know what island it is and that's where we did three weeks training i supposed to get ship used to us besides us getting used to the ship and we went all round near skapa around there then we came down to we joined a convoy as an escort and i think we did one of two escort vessels escort in the atlantic and then we went to the mediterranean and we did an escort there and then we came back and that's when d day was we came back for d day i don't know we just looked out and if it wasn't foggy we could see a few ships but they covered i mean there used to be about forty odd in a convoy and they were well spread out quite often couldn't see them not many of them anyway and we were escorts and we went away from them i was a radar rating on a convoy what is your day to day job when you were on a convoy oh just take over go on watch when it was time to go on watch we used to do form of west country keeping which is a bit difficult for one day you'd did your four hours on four off four on four off and then when you did the other day you did eight hours on which meant you got eight hours in your hammock well in theory but the trouble was there used to be a there used to be action stations so that and they were action stations i mean we spent an awful long time on dropping depth charges we never sunk anything but i know on one in february forty four we were on this anti sub i think it was the anti submarine flotilla lead by captain walker who was on another sloop he died in the july but we went into sink this submarine and i could hear this on a voice pipe and i could hear him saying ace of spades to naive of hearts that was us ace of spades to naive of hearts we joined the convoy on we would join the convoys he told us and then he went in and sunk the submarine our skipper was absolutely mad he really went mad he jumped on his hat and everything and this poor chap walker captain walker died in the july and our skipper was so pleased he gave us to make amends the day off and a tot we had i didn't because i was under twenty but those over twenty got an extra issue of rum which rather pleased them cause he spent all the war trying to get in to sink a submarine he did in the end after i left the ship july nineteen sorry january nineteen forty five he and two other blokes he was on i think he was on a ship then called the scotsman and they went in and sunk this submarine that was january nineteen forty five i think it was i can't remember the number i know they told us i think it was the kite was sunk a same ship virtually a doppelganger and she they sunk this hms i can't remember the name of it now and i know there were three survivors out of a hundred and ninety odd men and one of those died so only two survivors out of a ship of two thousand tons can you just describe i was a radar rating just looking at the well you see it's like looking at the television set and you've got this we had this big it was a round tube and it went twenty miles the beam from the radar set beamed out from the ship used to go twenty miles i was on it won't mean anything but i was on the two hundred and eighty five set that was a gunnery set but they had navigation sets as well it's a really difficult to describe i mean you just sat there and went round and round and round on this thing until you picked up an echo and then from call up to the bridge if you picked up an echo and where it was they'd either say would you know sort of follow it or somebody else was looking after it i can't remember how they used to say it it's a lot its seventy years used to have we used to have the aerial for the two hundred and eighty five which was the set i operated at which a gunnery set was what they called a fishbone aerial it was a long arm with lots of little antenna about six inches a foot long coming out from the aerial and then you'd have another aerial on the top of the mast that looked like an h and that would go round and round and round and that would be the navigators set that was operated by some by an ordinary an ordinary matlow but it was for the you know to tell the navigator where we was can you just remind me can you just tell me about life onboard you know what did when you weren't working some of the things you had to do when you weren't on set what was your living conditions like well the ship was originally designed for a hundred forty men and there was a hundred and ninety two or something onboard it was very crowded it rolled like nobody's business not as much as a corvette a corvette they reckoned would roll on wet grass but they did roll a lot and i remember there used to be an inclinometer i think that's how you say it moved backwards and forwards it just it always stayed at the vertical position but of course it moved as the ship moved and you could see it and the damn thing used to move it go up to about forty degrees you'd think it was going to turn over it didn't happen like that on a battle wagon i was sick once but that's because i came down off watch and the only piece of bread in the barge had a bit of green on it so i scraped the green off took it to the galley got it fried and put jam on it and i no sooner ate it that i gave neptune it went to him but that was the only time i was ever sick i used to feel a bit shaky when we go out and sometimes i get an oxo cube a drink of oxo and but once i had that i was never sick and i never felt sick when we were coming home when i came home from australia i was invalided home and we used to see these pongos sorry soldiers i remember this on the ship i came home the qsmv dominion monarch and we were five weeks getting home and these pongos would say get out of this done it being a sailor it's november directly turned right into gibraltar the bay of biscay it got a bit rough there's these pongos all stretched out and we go round and say fancy a bit of fat ham lovely nice bit of fat ham oh dear but no i was never sick that way the first time we went out at the beginning but i was never sick other than the once i told you but it wasn't bad i think we did once i can't remember much now but we used to have a pop at the jerries' when they came over they did i remember one or two of them came over specially when we were over of the coast of france just after d day the germans had a few aircraft the thing i remember about d day and it sticks in my memory it's the fact that we were all anchored in the bay off where i can't remember the name of the place and we all swung round on our anchor chains and there was a little landing craft near and it swung round and hit a mine and when the water subsided all what we could see was the flag disappearing down like that the rest had disappeared the rest had gone under the water they were all drowned obviously still it's one of those things i remember seeing the only time i ever saw it just after d day it was beautiful weather i don't know i got up i suppose about half past five to go on watch quarter to six looked over the side and saw three bodies drifting past but that's all i saw of d day other than firing and the few jerries' came over but they really didn't get to us i mean they had very good air cover and one thing that was funny was one chap was on watch on the radar and we reported that land was so far away and i said to him here that's not land you silly man i said they're aircraft there was about two hundred aircraft in a big heap going over to france to bomb but looking back on it over seventy years it was quite entertaining it was rough on d day and a day or so after and then we had fine weather because i remember one two items at that calm weather one day i was on the upper deck with another bloke standing there everybody's standing around while the ships moving and those that worked on all of a sudden and these aircraft flew very low over the ship and hand waved to us and we waved back and then we saw the dirty great black crosses on the wings and we realised of course they were jerries' by which time they disappeared but the skipper was mad that nobody had seen them the lookouts hadn't seen them and he made them all dress in number threes that's what we always wore number threes during that was the same as number ones your best uniform without gold badges you had red badges but that was standard during the war some had gold badges but they weren't supposed to but a and the other time just after d day i was standing looking over the side and i saw this thing coming thought was a torpedo and the bloke next to me i gave him a shake and couldn't talk to him and it wasn't a torpedo it was a porpoise or something like that dived up right came out from this wharf in front of the boat and dived underneath when we came home from gibraltar we came home in the may up to scotland forty four and we were going across the atlantic the ship i was on which had four inch guns and there were about three trawlers that was the rest and they used to have twelve pounder guns and sometimes they had one big gun and they suddenly said there's a load of germans a flotilla of german destroyers out well their guns were five sevens i think but they could fire a damn sight further than the four inch we had and it was a bit nerve racking going home if would of wanted when they came of watch have you seen anything but fortunately they didn't see us and we didn't see them what is said i know when we got home we were going round coming down the bristol channel and we got to i was on watch and i was doing the i can't remember now from the starboard side midship to starboard to midship ports through the bows with the radar set well we came up the other side of cornwall nobody told me to shift what i was doing i mean you only did things when you were told and we were in a thick fog and suddenly an almighty crash and we carved halfway through hms lowestoft that's when i went on a court of inquiry the first time i was ever and the only time i was ever spoken to by admirals with me sitting there i was still an ordinary seaman and i become an able seaman then and i hadn't got a badge on and a none substantive badge was stuck i got one to put on the new uniform i bought and because you buy everything in the navy you always did and so i stuck it on with tinned milk and it stayed on just long enough for this inquiry but i thought well if they find me guilty i'll do twenty years but it was quite worrying actually we went halfway through the ship cut it in half nearly the bows eventually stopped about halfway across unfortunately only two people were hurt it was in the afternoon and they got the dead lights they're things that covered the portholes and they got them up weren't suppose to have the up at sea but they got them up and a bloke on the lowestoft lookout through the port and christ we're going to be struck by another ship and everybody bar one bloke moved he said whose leg you pulling on he had a badly fractured leg because of that but oh and they had the cook who had just come up in his clean whites and we hit were the oil tanks were and he looked like well just went all over him because it went up in the air and down but that's about all i can remember of that yeah where abouts oo i don't know it's not very big the bristol channel well i know but was it it was down it wasn't the bristol channel it was as we gone round land's end cause it was a thick fog actually it's very hard to remember it was well i found it quite excited i don't know if anybody else did the things that we used to do most was drop depth charges and those damned things weighed i had them weighing a hundred weight they were like an oil drum and then they had those that they'd put an extra hundred weight on so they fall faster and we dropped dozens hundreds of depth charges i suppose i just don't know now i mean we did it from the january until i came off in the following october but i know that on one convoy we were on we dropped an awful lot of depth charges whether anybody was killed or anything i really don't know i joined in december i joined on december the eight th i remember that the ship hadn't been taken over by the admiralty until the eleventh what is said was it a brand new ship yeah it was still in i think it was thornycroft that built it up at glasgow and i stayed on that until the following october when i went into barracks i did another course on gunnery and then i got a draft chit and with an awful lot of other people to join a battleship called the duke of york she weighed forty five thousand tons it was like a small village i didn't like it but somebody i found out afterwards at the admiralty cause there was so many h o hostilities only men they well out numbered the regulars or seemed to i think they all got quite numbers the regulars and you know there was so many people there and on the duke of york it was like being in a village i mean there were fourteen i think fourteen hundred men on that well it's a lot of people i never got to know many of them i still get a christmas card well i didn't this christmas so maybe he's died from a chap i was on the duke of york with and i had a christmas card from him every year there after i sent him one and he sent me one hostilities war hostilities is if you're hostile your antagonistic aren't you well you signed on and went in as a regular i know my father was a an h o like me and when into the navy i've got his parchment downstairs like i got mine and when he went into the navy he was going in as a telegraphist he went in in nineteen seventeen and after been training for some little while he they called him one day and said we want you to sign this so he said hoare so he said what's it for oh he said just to do a five years dad says i'm not staying in for five years i've got an apprenticeship he was in the middle of an apprenticeship when he went well we all there wasn't enough room when we were cruising gentle down to australia there wasn't enough room for us to hang out all of us to hang are hammocks so you slept on the deck or on the row of lockers or something like that cause these ships what during war had a lot more men on them than what they were designed for i think the duke of york was designed for about eleven hundred men twelve hundred and there was fourteen hundred of us but i don't remember i didn't like it much on the duke of york although i went too i mean i went finally finished up in australia on the duke of york no we stopped there for three weeks in malta on our way out to the far east but most of that class did one of that class was sunk and that was the prince of wales she was sunk in the pacific when just before or just after singapore fell in nineteen forty two january forty two but the duke of york had one great battle honour and that was when she sunk the scharnhorst that was a german battleship before i joined yeah she had part of the mast where an eleven inch shell went through it on the scharnhorst there were people that had been on from then but i remember one chap swinging a lamp sorry telling a tale about you know when we fought the scharnhorst a bloke went up to him and says oh yeah that's interesting he said i was on the and we had thirty percent a third of our men killed when we went in to sink her but the blokes who really suffered one of the chaps i was with on the hart chap called glen denning he was a regular and he was a signalman and he was at crete and they lost an awful lot of men and what have you at crete and destroyers and ships and god knows what else and when he got home he lived in gloucester and he got home to gloucester and he knocked on the door and his mother fainted when she opened it and she was opening a paper said what a good bloke he was killed at crete and they'd written up his obituary in the paper and it was on the front page of the paper that his mother was reading and when he knocked at the door oh we all had to we all got i don't know if they do it now you get caught by the they have bears and these blokes go round the ship catching matlows that anybody that hasn't been over the line before and then you go on a line and they sit you on a chair and they shave you dirty great wooden razor and then when they finish shaving you they gave you a shove and you fall into a great pond of water behind it's great fun i know i was half way of mine half way up the mast got dressed i was in my number ones ready to go on watch and somebody was above me and he kept treading in my fingers so i got change when you look back on it was fun what is said well i had two skippers on the hart one of them was an old boy that was before when i was eighteen nineteen he'd been at jutland the cadet navel cadet and he'd done his time and finished time in nineteen thirty eight he was very interesting because he got his discharge from the navy with about four five other blokes who were officers they were in china and they built a boat and sailed it back home to britain and he wrote a book called the cruise to the i remember reading it very interesting that was yeah he was a funny bloke skipper he was single and he used to have a notice on his door which appeared every time we got to port got into port quite officer sleeping and one of the chaps on the hart was a postman used to go to shore to get the post and said he had to laugh this lady came up to him when he was home on leave said excuse me i believe you are on hms hart so he said yes madam she said my sons on the hart oh yes he said madam thinking it was no deal like that she said i wonder if you would keep an eye on him so he said i'll do my best she says that's martin sherwood it was the skipper his name was martin b sherwood i don't remember the other skipper he was on the ship when i came back off leave in the august and he talked to the other chaps like like a dutch uncle prior to weighing them off they used to say you shouldn't off been you shouldn't off been late you know from leave how long for you you get a day for every hour you were adrift and if you got more than fourteen days i think it was you went to naval prison or you could go to a naval prison we had oh i don't know i think it was interesting we'd been on patrol from gibraltar into the atlantic and we had three blokes that were on jankers and we in the afternoon you have a rest when you're in the tropics but they didn't they had to scrub the deck and i suppose they thought fuck this and they chucked the buckets over the side the trouble what the twits didn't realise they were wooden buckets and the skippers on the bridge looks over and sees these buckets floating past so we rushed off dropped a boat and picked the buckets up so the jerries' wouldn't know we were around there and he had frightened everybody he i remember when i fell in a petty officer said to me i should get to the other end son if i was you and they told off six blokes they put them in battledress you know with gaiters and belt a rifle and everything they took them on the upper deck and put these three blokes that done it and he lines them up on the foc'sle and they were he was going to shoot them seriously and then he said i could shoot you and i'd be within my rights he said but we won't do that we'll wait until we get to gibraltar and they got weighed off in gibraltar they did everybody weighed off sent to prison over a certain number of days had to do an extra twenty eight days on the rock and they got ninety days so they did all told a hundred and eighteen days and that's because they didn't want to scrub the decks in the afternoon when the rest of us were having a rest oh i don't know about it all it said on the door was he'd hang it on the door like you might hang something on a knob of a door it said quiet officer sleeping it wasn't a very big ship the hart you know no wrns on the ship they came from the shore it's only the last few years that women have been allowed to go to sea well you'd never see they'd only come on if very seldom did they come on we saw more women dockyard workers and didn't know much on them but we didn't have anything to do with wrns didn't very seldom have something to do with ordinary seaman the only wrn i knew as something to do with the seaman was my wife she was a wrn but not that i remember i remember having birthday when we were of sumatra and i got really brahms and liszt and woke up next morning on top of a gun turret absolutely soaked and i thought i'd peed myself and i suddenly realised it was a dirty great tropical storm that's the only time i've ever seen sheets seven sheets seven bolts of lightning at one go that was off sumatra cause when we went to on the way out we went to ceylon well it's called sri lanka now and i remember going for a road up to candy which was the old capital of ceylon and that had the lake of the sacred turtles and the lake of this and the lake of that and we went into the some temple or something temple of sacred tooth or temple of the tooth and i said to the bloke there i said well let's have a shufty at the tooth he said you can't go in there nobody looks at the tooth it's in a golden silver casket or something and that was locked behind something else oh god i thought i only wanted a look at it but that's about all we were going up there and that's where i got injured a dirty great wave come onboard and swept three of us along the quarter deck we lined up on the quarter deck and next thing i remember i was banged against the davit and then slightly washed over the side and i was hanging on like grim death with sort of half over the side and half on the ship and when i got inboard there was an officer commander on the deck and he said where's your cap so i said it's floating down there sir oh well don't come on the quarter deck again in war without a cap on that was that you know there very caring but then i as i said that bugged me against there and i went to we were in wallamaloo i went from there to the hospital at herne bay and that's new south wales by the way and then i was in hospital in new south wales from the august that was when the war finished until the october i think at the beginning of october and i came home on a trooper i got a hip displaced and i was no longer fit for naval service they said and they gave me eight shillings a week for two years that's forty pence a week for two years but that's about all i get a lot more than that now i read about two thousand and two just after my wife died it said if you i forget what it was on but it said if you had a pension and it had finished or you thought you should have one you should write to the can't remember where now and they were very good got me fifty percent pension i was alright for a little while cause i had this leave to come but like a twit i only took a fortnight of it then went back to work but i had ten or twelve weeks leave that i got paid for and here i am working i should of taken that leave i've regretted it ever since i suppose it did i really don't remember much about it i remember it was a damn good thing because i couldn't see my girlfriend she joined up in the wrns but she used to come home with unfailing regularity once a fortnight that lasted for about year and then i got married and we got married london i remember coming home a my parents had suddenly found out were cockneys i've never noticed it before and also london was very dirty and the house that i lived in looked a lot smaller but other than that i just went back to work
