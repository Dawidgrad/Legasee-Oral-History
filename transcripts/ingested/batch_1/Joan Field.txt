i served from nineteen forty one to nineteen forty five basically western approaches that includes plymouth right the way up to the top of scotland and what's your name joan field i was joan rose where are you from and what are the circumstances to you joining the wrns i was actually born in cambridgeshire at a little village called meldreth in i think it was fiftieth century thatched cottage which was my grandmothers small holding i was born there and my parents worked on the small holding in nineteen thirty four we moved to a new town of welwyn garden city where my father then got employment and i lived there and went to school there and won a scholarship and a bursary to high school which is in welwyn garden city and i'm matriculated at which was then a school of matriculation i was then seventeen and i wanted to join the war had broken out by then obviously i wanted to join the wrns i went down i thought i'll hopefully get in the wrns if not i'll have to go into the waaf but they accepted me into the wrns at the time they were only taking on cooks and stewards which of course i did not want to do i did an eye test and they decided i had perfect eye sight then and i was told i was going to be a signaller it didn't mean much to me but i didn't mind what it was and i was called up just a month before christmas to hms cabbala which is up in warrington what year was that i'm just trying to think nineteen forty one in the middle of nineteen forty one and i thought this is marvelous all the officers at christmas were waiting this is a lovely idea but of course that was short lived it was very tough at cabbala you were given two weeks what they call probabtion and you were given all the dirty jobs to do in overalls scrubbing the floors cleaning the loos it was make or break time really squad drill and squad drill you hated squad drill but i got to love it after that but that's another story at the end of the fortnight we were accepted some of them went home and some of them went awol if you went awol then you just went into munitions or what have you but if you didn't really like it then perhaps the waaf would have had you we were first choice in those days everyone wanted to go in the wrns and so i started my visual signaling and coding i did some coding as well but basically visual signaling and the course lasted i think six months yes it was about six months no four months i think and after that time you went on leave and then you were drafted to different places we all of course put down for plymouth all wanted to come south because i lived then in welwyn garden city obviously so it was south i wanted i ended up in oban i never even heard of it i had to find it on the map when i got the draft i didn't even know where it was i found it and i thought this is lovely it will be lovely up there' can i just go back a bit you sounded like you were emphatic about wanting to join the wrns over any other service why i don't know i got no naval all my father and grandfather all served in the army i don't know what it was i loved the sea maybe the uniform do you know i don't really know but i always wanted to be in the wrns it was just something i think stephanie had the same when you read her book there is an attraction to it i suppose in a way it's a sort of glamour of the wrns now you mentioned cabbala and you mentioned ship visualization and coding but i'd like to know a bit more about what you were learning and how you learnt visualization and what was the process well first of all you got to learn the morse code even at seventeen that was a bit tricky but still you learn the morse code and that is absolutely drummed into you the morse code is it purely repetition yes really and truly and you learn gimmicks to learn it you know f for face you learn all these gimmicky things to remind you it is tough we were all put into classes and the visual signallers classes all began with a v and my class was verity and i can't remember what stephanie's class is but she does mention it in the book the wireless telegraphers classes all began with a w like warspite and the coding classes all began with a c and each course was a different length and we learnt morse code semaphore to signal with flags you know like the old nelson signal which kept changing learning the phonetic alphabet which half way through our course changed so the americans could understand it which annoyed us because why should we have to change after all these years anyway so the phonetic alphabet every class was manned by an ex serving man usually a chief who'd never dealt with women before and some of them were a bit tough a bit tough but we needed it because we were completely raw to it all and we were taught naval discipline and different time watches you know how to read a twenty four hour clock which of course we hadn't started to use then the basics really basics and i found it quite enjoyable it was just like being at school really and what about your wrenery where were you staying what was that like pretty spartan but not too bad it was old nissan huts i think they'd been used by i think she definitely mentions it in her book i think they had been used by the post office they were old nissan huts on this big site at newton just outside warrington and it's obviously now been developed into a big housing estate but it was a very large camp mostly the wrenery but there was also men onboard as well they were learning i think wt but we were obviously being trained to take over some of the signal stations from the men to release them which we learnt afterwards obviously so i got my draft up to oban and when you get a draft how is your communication with your parents and this draft you say oban blimey where's that' how did you get there what did your parents think well a bit staggered with my mother and my father my father took me up to euston station i got this draft just a thing report to i suppose it was patrol police up at euston then i was sent to no i went to kings cross and had to go to euston all this military stuff all in civvies you were only allowed to take a suitcase of cloths one outfit of civvie clothes and then the usual pajamas always pajamas you know the usual sort of things you were going into hospital i suppose but only one set of civilian clothes and to report to this place at one of the stations i think it was kings cross and they took me under their wing and sorted me out and got me onto the train my father saw me off and that was really all that happened i ended up where ever am i going you go miles and miles and of course there was quite a few sailors going up going back of leave and they were all kind to me they all realised what was happening and the train was crowded and i can remember we couldn't sit down anywhere and one of the sailors put me up on top of the rack at the top so i could have a sleep i can always remember that we got to carlisle there was an air raid warning and we had to stay in carlisle siding for about an hour which meant that i had missed my train from carlisle to sterling where i had to change again so that was another problem got to sterling and of course the train to oban had gone so i was stranded the wvs put me up in a hotel or hostel for the night and i went on to oban reported to oban to the officer in charge at oban and was told i was going to the pier signal station in the morning i was going to the pier signal station and in the meantime of course i'd been kitted it out at cabbala we were kitted up but i didn't have any bell bottoms that was essential for a vs wren because it was so cold so i was issued with bell bottoms and the next day went on duty and i thought this is crazy all this sort of business at cabbala and all the strict discipline naval discipline nobody seemed to be bothered up in oban i don't even think they realised there was a war on except for the convoys coming in i liked it i liked scotland stephanie didn't like it if you're reading her book or you've ever read it she just didn't seem to mix in very well with scottish people but i've got a scottish grandfather so i did accept it more and i realise that they're a bit insula they didn't mean to be off putting but they were it's an insular land up in the highlands i don't know whether you know the highlands very well they're a thing unto themselves ok well so just describe a bit about oban what the base was like what your surrounding were like where you slept and then we'll talk about the work well oban first of all i was stationed in what was called the station hotel and the signals station on the pier was only a short walk away and i met up with a girl that was going to work with me she had been there about a week we hadn't yet started getting the convoys in so we were told what was going to happen but the convoys would come in and they'd be in a bay and we had to man it all the time we weren't allowed to go on any boats but that's another story we had to monitor everything coming in and out we also had to look after funny enough the raf had their sunderlands and catalina's up there and they had a call sign which changed every hour and half of them could never ever read it so we used to have to read their code signal for them to send their patrol boat out but that was unbeknown to our base that never had a clue what was going on it was a crazy set up really and the submarines on patrol duty used to come in alongside the pier we had to give them their signals when they went out on patrol but that was mostly what we were doing at the pier signal station but this wasn't adequate enough and ganavan signal station which was right around the corner from where we were was still manned by the men and they also had the new asdics centre opening up just below which was radar on asdic that was still done by the men and the men was going from ganavan and they were going over to lismore and the wrns weren't allowed out there because they were completely alone out there there was no habitation just a few sheep farmers so the wrns weren't allowed out in lismore and that's where the photograph was taken unbeknown to anybody so the ganavan signal station was going to oban and we was going to go there which meant great difficulty because from the station hotel to ganavan was about two or three miles in the middle of the night that's no joke so eventually i was there for about at pier signal station from about i would say about a month before ganavan was opened ganavan signal station was then opened up for the wrns and we took over from the men and we had an intake of more vs wrns so there was now six of us instead of four and we took over ganavan from the men very very spartan when we was at the pier station we were able to have meals in the mess proper meals and when we were on night watch they would do us up sandwiches and when we moved from pier signal station to the ganavan signal station we were stationed at a place called lodge which was very tough going they didn't like watch keepers because they couldn't handle us nearly all the wrenery was writers or wt operators who worked proper watch hours they were nine until five not us we had to do watch keeping hours same as the navy so if we were lucky you would get a hot dinner if you didn't you just got a sardine sandwich so the food was pretty sparse if you read in the book people my friends who read the book say why did you stand it' but i said there was a war on we didn't know any different we had to do it it was our job' the men it was a very very sparse signal station do you want me to describe it to you what is said yes please yeah the signal station itself was right on top of ganavan just by dunollie house which is the house of the lord and lady macdougall i think they were called yes macdougall and it was on their land and it had been built as a look out coast i think originally for the coast guards it was very sparse it was a two tier place you had to reach it but to get to it it was a climb up a cliff almost a sheer cliff a road went below us and this sheer cliff up which we had to carry the oldest lamp batteries which was very heavy and then we had to have a coal fire a because we had to be able to burn any confidential books that we had if any if we had any kind of invasion we had to put the books goodness knows how because they were lead line but that's why we had the fire we had a bunk down below and a signal up top and a balcony all around we had a big ten inch aldis lamps an rt set and it was really just go we were pushed into the deep end and how far could you see from there what was your vista oh we could see where she'd got it right from we could see right the way down to mull over to lismore we had perfect vision of everything that was coming and going why was that such an important stretch of coast line in terms of the convoys and your role there because it was very safe they thought they could come in and if you had a look at a map it is a complete bay and tobermory the escort ships and usually about two or three destroyers dropped the convoy off and went up to tobermory then they would go up the sound of mull if you could visualize that coastline mull almost protects the bay so any ships passing have to go around behind mull they don't realise come in that's another story about the duke of york i think it was a very safe haven they came in they were escorted off from us probably down to gourock into the clyde for unloading or they would mass up ready to go out and the eta of arrival or an expected time of dispatch they were either coming or going and what was the most ships you think you ever saw there i don't know the whole harbour would be full i would say thirty more than that yes thirty most likely and of course you'd have a list and unfortunately you think there might be a straggler but they never came and that was a terrible thing and you wonder what happened to that one we had quite a lot of losses unfortunately not in the bay you know coming and going you'd expect to see a load of ships yes because we'd have a list sent to us which was a confidential list and an expected time of arrival and you'd give them about two or three hours but they never came and you just wonder what happened and they were all manned by mostly merchant men so their morse wasn't very good but now and again you'd get a ship that had a few united states when america came in it was better planned you know the liberty ships came and they were better manned and a little bit overpowering really because they were so shall i say this over clever they used to send morse at the rate of knots thinking that we couldn't answer it and we would send back at the same rate this is why we didn't like the americans very much i'm afraid they tried all sorts of things they tried to come up to our signal station and we couldn't have them in we weren't allowed to have them in we had one or two problems with people coming up shall i go on yeah one night i could hear footsteps coming up and a knock on the door and i thought this voice i didn't know who it was it was a man's voice and we'd already had a wren murder in inveraray a vs wren murdered in inveraray on night watch so we were all we were all taught how to handle a pistol we had to go on the range which was the raf had a range and we were taken onto the range by an instructor and we were taught to fire a pistol and i have very small wrists and i was taught to fire holding my wrist so i could fire with my wrist we also had a rifle up in the signal station it wasn't loaded there was no ammunition in it but the pistols were but this rifle wasn't loaded it was just there as a warning i heard these footsteps and this is perfectly true i heard these footsteps coming up and i said to my oppo i don't like this very much' so this kept knocking on the door and in the end i got this rifle and i thought i can't i knew it wasn't loaded and i thought what am i going to do so i put it up the other way and as this voice came through the thing i lifted it up and was going to clock him on the head with it and he said it's alright joan it's only me' and it was one of the signalman from down below stupid who'd got a date i had changed watches with a girl i shouldn't tell this really he obviously used to come up for a cup of tea at this time and have a cup of tea with her and he thought she was on watch and in the end he could of got himself killed and i would have been quite within my rights because nobody we've got a great big prohibited notice on the door and it never ever came to anything and i never ever reported it because it would of got him into terrible trouble but we were armed but only with a pistol and a rifle with no ammunition because we had a wren in inveraray what were the circumstances of that i don't know i'm afraid all that is a need to know you were never ever told what happened we were just told to be very aware and to take extra precautions and i think stephanie mentions this in her book as well we never ever knew what had happened and i mean we had what we thought was a spy that come down and it was all prohibited land for civilians but this man used to come down and sit on the rocks and wait for the convoys and he had binoculars and a camera and we were not allowed to take photographs of the convoys we could take photographs around our cabin around the thing but not the convoys not allowed to so we reported this man to our headquarters in signals back in station hotel and nothing ever happened about it he just disappeared we never heard whether he was just a local newspaper man or whether he was a kind of spy or whether he was just interested in ships we never heard i'm afraid in those days it was all need to know you were never ever told and just picking up on the americans you were talking about because the americans gave you some hassle yes well they would try to bribe us they wanted to come up the signal station look honey we've got some nylons' or honey we've got bananas onboard you know this sort of thing it was so stupid and childish we took a dislike to them what we didn't like was the way they used to treat their officers complete disrespect they would call them by their first names which we thought was terrible and the captains and all the officers never seemed to take any notice of them and in oban one day shopping and the americans who came onboard came shopping as well and they would like to take us for a cup of coffee and ok fine which they did we took them to the ymca and had a cup of coffee going back some of their officers were coming the other way well we were appalled the way they spoke no saluting hiya hiya cap' i thought this is terrible i can't describe it they were just another world away and they were trying to bribe us with bananas and nylons and we just didn't want to know we thought it was so childish with all this very fast flashing morse you touched on the different methods of communication you had the semaphore you talked about the lamps there so just when do you used different types of communication or is it one specific type in oban in the station always by morse by light or sometime by rt but nearly always the rt we only really used for the asdic station but lamps aldis and all the big ten inch which was very difficult of course to handle you had to go out on the balcony and of course up there the winds were always at gale force and we always had to hoist the cones for the weather every day every day we had to hoist the cones for the convoys to know what the weather was what is said what were the cones the cones were the cone was a shape like that and you hoisted it up for the north wind and down for the south wind very primitive but it gave them some idea where the wind another thing you could tell which way the wind was blowing just look at the ensign which we always had to fly the white ensign and we had to by the colours put it up at sunrise and down at sunset so the ensign was always flying so you could always tell which way the wind was blowing without the cone and if it was a gale force wind we used to put the cone up which sometimes meant the cone was up for days because the gales would blow up there very windy and sometimes we would have to be lashed onto the ten inch by our oppo because it was so windy you kept being blown away it was very very cold and we were always wet but it didn't seem to matter did you have a bath or a shower up there when we went back how long would you be situated up there then well the night watch was a long one we'd go on something like eight o'clock and come off at eight o'clock next morning that was a very long one the other watches was pretty well four hours on four hours off but in the night watch was a tough one you said you had to walk there and back first of all we had to walk we couldn't we objected because the men in the asdic station down below us got transport they were working the same watches well yes ok then they decided they would issue us with bicycles which they did we had a wren officer come up to see us and she said this isn't good enough and then they supplied transport for us so we didn't have to walk the night watch backwards and forwards three or four miles in the pitch dark along a coast road but first of all we had to before they realised what was happening there is a story about the duke of york can you tell me about that the duke of york we never had the big ships the escort ships never really came into us just destroyers or corvettes because they always used to go into mull to wait for the convoys to go back out so we never had anything what i would call large i was on watch with stephanie on this particular occasion and if you can picture the islands and the sea and suddenly you see a great big cross mast coming at you and you thing what an earth is that you had no idea what it could possibly be and we had no eta for anything we had nothing it was moving very slowly it got bigger and bigger we couldn't believe it of course we called it up and there was no reply and of course that was worrying because there was no reply because every hour it changed the call up sign had changed in the code book so you would call them up by the code what it was for the day and no reply so we had a little ship we had two ships actually one was called the southern star and one was called the southern wave and they were patrols ships and they used to patrol backwards and forwards along the convoys all the time they were old something i would call something like a corvette i think they were old trawlers they were manned by navy and they were if any trouble we called them up immediately and we called up the southern star she was way out over mull and we asked her what it was all about and she said i can't see anything from here' because they would be way way she said i'll go and investigate' she said if it's any trouble i'll put a shot across it's bows' and that was that anyway this thing got bigger and bigger eventually i managed to call up obviously the bunting tosser that was visual signallers are called bunting tossers was asleep i should think he thought we're only coasting around these islands and he came back quickly d of y instead of a pennant number because all ships have pennant numbers either the pennant number of the ship of the code but she came back quickly with d of y and i said to stephanie d of y duck of york' i said gosh it's a battleship and base don't know' so we quickly phoned our base and they didn't believe us because nobody had got an eta anyway the captain of our base came rushing down took him about half an hour to get to us by which time she was in full view massive great thing it just filled up the whole of the bay i've never seen anything like it and of course it was a great big who har about this why didn't we know well of course she was on pilgrimage up to norway after the scharnhorst and she was doing this i suppose she though they'd got time i don't know why they did it they were way of course she must have known the way very well because it's very dangerous out there but she did she came right passed us just of mull i mean i can show you exactly where she was on a map she just appeared by the islands as if it was on some kind of film it was incredible and the sort of thing you dream about lovely story nobody ever really again need to know we never really found out but we realised afterwards what it was all about she was on her way up to the battle in norway what is said d day d day came we had all ships we couldn't understand why they looked so dreadful they were all sort of battered ships and we thought we'd seen some awful sites but there was about fifty of them with two destroyers the durban and something else one was the durban and one was something else maybe she mentioned it in the book anyway and we thought gosh the destroyer looks in terrible state surely the navy we had no idea what they were they came in i suppose they came in a week about ten days enough time for stephanie to get to know this signalmen yes it must be ten days we still couldn't understand why they were in such a state and why they didn't because they only ever stayed two or three days but they seemed to be a long time and we thought hello something is going on then all our we were told we were not allowed to post anymore letters all our letters were to be cancelled all our postage out was to be cancelled everything going out from the base was to be stopped and all leave was stopped and we thought something was in the air you know you get that feeling we thought well where they are going what are they going to do and of course they were the block ships the night before d day they didn't know what they were doing they had no idea what it was all about or so they said the night before they all seemed to be getting ready a big ship came alongside some of them and took of a lot of stuff we thought they don't usually unload here it goes to gourock and greenock but they were unloading all sorts of stuff and we watched them through the telescope you know chairs and tables and all sorts of things were coming out and we couldn't understand this next day when we came up on watch they were all busy ready to go out and we had no expected time of departure at all they all just seemed to disappear and our two patrol ships had no idea they said what do we do they're going' we couldn't tell them because it was so secret and that was d day that was the block ships going down they were all rotten old ships that nobody wanted the two destroyers had been so battle scarred that they were almost sinkable so they were the two big block ships and these were sent down to help out and we never ever heard until the end of the war what it was all about these were obviously then the block ships a thing you touched on earlier but i'd like more clarification on is that the convoys essentially you did talk about this documentation so can you just explain again for me you know how the process a dispatch rider would arrive from base from station hotel which was their base a dispatch rider would arrive with a confidential letter which would contain eta of the next convoy coming in so right you'd then get it out put it in front of you and put it up and wait for the first one to come in eta nine am and perhaps they wouldn't start to come in until nine thirty they'd obviously been marked i think from ireland they were then sort of marked across get the eta of them coming across and that was literally how we got the eta from the dispatch rider confidential letter would come i suppose they're every the convoys were coming in quite regularly at least once a month coming in by the time they'd gone out again the bay was nearly always choka block and then of course you've also got the raf boats going backwards and forwards with their sunderland's and catalina's so it was quite a busy little harbour and every single thing had to be logged and logged out identified and put down you know you had to be on watch pretty well aware what was going on all around you literally in the air with the catalina's this why we had to have southern wave and southern star who used to be out they were also signaling and trying to get it was really like a great big heard of sheep and two shepard's trying to keep them in it could have been organised chaos but it wasn't it was very very good it always worked it was just sheparding these ships you know these big liberty ships they were quite big and do these liberty ships have its own call sign which you would yes each we knew each one we had a identification for each one so we could mark them off if not we've got everyone's name the list wasn't very long but yes we had identification for all of them you had to concentrate quite hard when they were coming in you couldn't let your attention wander because you know you've got to be so quick and you talked about some of them not coming how do you feel when you've done five convoys and you're missing twenty boats what was the feeling well first of all when it first happened its' you wonder what happened to those i hope they're alright but by the time you've done it for about a year or so you just except it you know what do you do you don't know what has happened to them you never know what's happened again you've got this need to know we used to try and find out but we were never ever told that three of them probably been sunk off somewhere you think i wonder how far they got and what happened to the men but you know what happened to all that lovely stuff that was coming in or going out i don't know you just don't know you never knew you just had to accept whatever was happening just and leave it put all your sort of personnel feelings aside because it was no good worrying about it because what could you do and what do you remember of ve day ve day i was still on watch on ve day i don't remember much about it because i was up in scotland we were invited to a big parade in edinburgh which we did take part in later on but the big ve parade we thought by the time we get there i mean it's a journey from oban to edinburgh i mean it's you just don't get on your bike and go you've got i don't remember we just had a party that was all we had a party we were never allowed obviously the rum the rum ration but sometimes we used to go on the ships used to come in and we had a tot of rum but i hated it i didn't like it very much of course after the war i was in the royal naval association and i was vice chairman of the branch of the royal naval association and they used to have tots up there always offered me i don't like it it's to hot and to fiery for me so ve day was really just a tot of rum and a knees up in the base and vj day the end of the war totally the end of the war where was i at the end of the war i was out toward point in dunoon because as the convoys were no longer needed we were no longer needed so stephanie went to ireland and i went to toward point dunoon to hms brontosaurus and that was the ships coming back and forth down the clyde and that was where i spent vj day and just another knees up really you can't say much more about it and from there i could either stay in the wrns or i could be demobbed from there which i was demobbed because i wanted to go on a social services course so i already lined up what i wanted to do in a way now i regret now not staying in i think in a way but it happened it didn't work out like that and how do you reflect on it all now many years later i enjoyed it i quite liked it i'm glad i did it it was an experience i'll never have again and nobody will ever have again because it will never happen like that again i enjoyed my time up there i loved the highlands
