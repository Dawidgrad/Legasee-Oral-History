when did you go out in this and pick up the aircraft and what was i like a member then coming on first time co memorable coming on but it but only vaguely you know it's a we actually went up the slide she replied to pick the aircraft over and he is the ship moving or station who now moving yeas much speed as possible to get so i create a wind across the decks so that went outwardly we had swordfish and grumman market the fighters and they were a grand little plan that was the easy handle well we used to handle them on deck you see in most of was stuck on deck permanently because there's only room for about four aircraft in anger so the rest were stuck on deck on patron special seals yeah i know we use a when when we would at landing training that was hard that we leave grenok at six in the morning and get back about eight at night every day perhaps seven days not for five and seven days and doing flying training all time is you know well by time we got out and we go right into middle at clyde and then they come from i think it was macrianisy call this place they these trainee pilots come and practice landing on us were quite a few go other side i suppose they're still there but it were very hard work that and when when they said we were going on axis active service everybody gave a cheer i think and we were i thought we were better off when we are on active service in doing that over it was bloody hard work when you were getting the planes landing on they were crashing on you know what what was the sort of procedure for fires and stuff fires are did you did you have a process if a cutiplayn cross and burst into flames oh well we've got us fire porters esa then i think the majority of time if a plane did crash and cut into flame they'd get push it over side and get rid of it but it won't be any good did you prefend the pirates oh yeah get the crew that out he did you did you meet the pirates oh yes we met quite a few of them here in fact there was one from one below climate he lived in dromfield golden benito his name he would train to be a pilot and one i saw him twice i think about twice when he had passed out and he went on a different carrier and never saw him again after that but yea they were quite they were on it you know different people out ottoman is hard to say really and they the most of them were grammar school students you know and the it's a hell of a job landing on a plant carry it went easy i mean you know we on them russian convoys we sometimes got a thirty degree slope like that and they were taking off on the a little mantles i e as though the thought have see bloody lot on what kidding i mean i plan a come to land you you be like that and and might play and come to land all of us one to go like that and cost plain it he just bump it and gone or so office they were they were all rating what went one way because what happened with them if they did that the undercarriage collapsed so they landed flat on deck without any undercarriage you know so crew got out with the wire to stop in the rest is oh yes across the deck are a they were they were four on activity but the ad at used have a big barrier used to come up as well in front of the bridge and right across and if a play missed old wires it went straight into meshing at least i didn't knock the plains over so i know but when we were doing that to take landing training i mean we were spending about twelve hours out on doing it and then then we had to sail back into grand and that was you know it's sometimes eight to nine o'clock at night before we got back been out since six we were at or hard work and that when i can not remember they said we've finished doing we've done it now when acid station now in active service everybody cheered thank christ for that mean it was same engine room they had the same problems the built for engine the engine room staff we called a one two four and so on to four excellently verde to night of her they are merchant seamen come into royal navy for six months you know because they they were that short of engineering staff you know in the navy and after six months to put an ex on end so they couldn't get out but they were better off than us financially because they get the merchant navy pay a new quite a few aliya
