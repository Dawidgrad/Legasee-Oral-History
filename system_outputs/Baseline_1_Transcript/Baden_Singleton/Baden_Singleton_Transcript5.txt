my my way of unwinding after a sticky convoy was i discovered the naval navy ran a brothel and i went there originally for the obvious reason but very soon attached to one girl and i would go in there and we'd have a cup of tea she even did my mending and we'd have a chat and it was wonderful to have a female company without who didn't need the sex she was there to get money to get married and i didn't mind i respected all those girls one one particular time i came in there of an evening and i'd had a few beers and i'm set and in comes jack you see he'd had a few beers and he took off his cap and slung it like a one of those dis things you see and it caught my forehead here well up stands baden going to take over but now he didn't i was grabbed and i was in her room she wouldn't let me fight and i had to stay there cup tea and so were up and you know it it became quite a food friendship really dead and i was grateful the one thing we we forgot about we did the first trip outside the harbour when i was sick but first action i wish i was a later on an oregon old fashioned ordican that had the gunner did the elevation and i had to do the left right business and i was also the loader now when the magazine ran out she on one side of the shield the action side where if there's any bullets common they're mine the gunners behind the shield i was shaken so much with fear actual fear it was i could not load that magazine i could get it up there but i couldn't hedge it in he had to come round and do it were you actually under fire while yes yes yes oh yes and that's just what it was about you know first time in action i 'd never been in action then was this on the romeo this was on the romeo and the romeo and but after that no i was all right so once that moment had passed that one just at one time you know i suppose i've always set any one first time into act and who's not frightened it's either an idiot or a damned fool you know i don't see how anybody could possibly say they show no fear on their first dose of action like the gunner he never mentioned it which if if i'd seen it i wouldn't have mentioned it in the same same after action i would stay on the gun platform and i was i was with betty that was another way of cooling because you go down to the mastic and somebody says something wrong everyone's on edge everyone no matter who they are and you only got to say something wrong and you've got problems and betty was your pen friend well yes that's that's all that time i was i was in love with her but it was a pen friend you know i i did that six weeks training and we were there together for six weeks but then all i did meet another girl you see when i went to have and i met joyce and we became very friendly but i never followed that i was going into a war i didn't want to get involved any more how important were the letters that betty wrote to you very much very much that was home it was not listening to vera lynn you know how in every you you drop a pin when vera was on and you were in trouble so despite the fact that when you start corresponding with betty she was only fourteen she actually sustained you through those difficult moments at sea very much so i've a lot to thank her for los oh yes if if you had something like that to hang on to you retained your sanity you know it's i think we all had our different ways of coping you you had to have something you and a lot of people say with mine sweeping or or that sort of sweeping how did you do that well you didn't think about it you don't but when you're in action you don't think about it and you try not to think about it afterwards it's not something to dwell on that's why you won't find anything in my memories if somebody wants to know about action turn on the telly they can see it there war war is not something to glory it's not you do what you do and at the end you forget it try to but what what you did you did and coped in the best way you could yes oh yes we all had our own ways i suppose i mean once i settled down i could go off and shop with the best of em i hope we did and i was what else you do when you got some money in your pocket this brussel in alexandria which was run by the royal navy was their way perhaps of acknowledging that sailors needed some way to let off steam yes and it was it was from a safety valve for the navy because they knew then that the men weren't going to go up town and catch disease so it was closely regulated medical checks and so yes always and you even had panasilla does afterwards you are always given a cube benson and i note squeezed down naif i did go back to your time in action did you find yourself manning the erlican very often then at action stations that was my job yes that was my job and the same a on the wall borough there was one man a recon and i had for a while but then he put me on the four inch not happy i didn't do that at all you you were hanging about if you weren't actually now getting the shells from the to the love that sort of thing not if you could do something you didn't think but luckily we we didn't have much problem an ai think the only one that we not in anger i suppose we met this ship up round the islands and she wouldn't respond to recognition you see and we put a star shell over her panic on that ship oh and the panic we did find out what she was and that finish she was a turkish job why they didn't answer i don't know but they did eventually when the star shell was slipping over so did you ever hit anything with your erlican i don't think so i don't think so is it's difficult now a plane is traveling pretty fast and you you've got to get so far ahead do you know you've got to judge the speed if they're going across the vision if they're coming towards you but of course the elevation is changing slowly and it's a difficult job to do it and cause that was really our armament the four inch one much used up for aircraft they were just the three origins and any stones you had her you could throw
