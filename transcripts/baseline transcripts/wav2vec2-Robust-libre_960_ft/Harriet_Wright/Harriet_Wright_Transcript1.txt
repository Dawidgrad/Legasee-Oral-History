harriet edith prosser was when i joined the friends that was my name harriet where are you from and why did you decide you want it to be a red well i have had other people ask me that and i think myself because i was abenhaired a pale skinned and freckle faced i didn't think that the e t s would suit me the uniform you know and i thought that the navy blue wood and i think that's the only reason because we didn't live by sea we were lived in land you know farming stock where are you from aberdeenshire so you say what what what impact did the war have on you as a young girl living in abiding well am i was still at school of course i went to inverurie academy and i was still at the academy and i remember am there used to be a reconisence playing come over every night you could almost set your watch by it eight clockish and you nii knew we all knew that the engine had a different noise to it you know so you could tell that it was a german plane and then one night it was much more noisy and my father went outside mother went outside and then i decided i would follow and i had my hand on the door knob still this hand and all of a sudden we heard this whistle and it was a on that they dropped in a ploughed field only about a quarter of a mile away so that made me think that was you know at that stage when you're up there you don't think of a well conflict like that do an especially in the country and yet this is what happened and the lovely firework display all the sparks coming up on the greens and what mark you know but i think what happened was a aircraft had come up from our broth they couldn't come up from dice because the right on top of dice you see you been right on top edie and he had dropped this bomb to get away quickly but they had two bombs in aberdeen they bombed the ice rink and vote i can't remember what and then i went into aberdeen one day a for some shopping and believe it or not i still can't understand why i did and i heard this plan and i'm looking up and it was just roof top high and they were using the machine guns rate that at you know and and i'm standing there like that waiting for the bus at the country buff station and school hill waiting to go home what an idiot instead of runninininto the doorway or something like that you know so i got this sort of thing a very early on and we ourselves thought they were maybe after the every in a tan for bridges see if they bombed those they would have had an awful lot of trouble getting round and a long way to go you know for the trains and things to get say up to this out to get stuff over to the orkneys and that sort of thing so i thought right i won't do my bit
