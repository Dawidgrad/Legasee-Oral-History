we had a nine semen a two four six stalkers two i think yes when we come to telegraphic and signalman there were two each of them i think as dick there were three radar there would have been three in an engine room as i say we other stokes there was two two engine men and one chief po and you had skipper am the first lieutenant was a lieutenant commander am a shop and lieutenant how could we had one two three i left left one lieutenant and one shop lieutenant a cube of tuna bush was the sharp room lieutenant general course tenant commander was first number one and the skipper of war he is head of the family lily first lieutenant was a canadian rot raabe all canadian navy a fisherman i think though he was also a merchant navy yes yes very very few we didn't like our rain we were different and we were harry tate navy churches pirates do you know how we became churchill's pirates he churchill came along the docks one day and because we were never in any naval rigs normally we might wear the trousers but anything on top and he asked who in hell is that not and when he was told he said that he they looked like a lot of bloody pirates that were his words so that's us how we picked up the name church was pires and harry tate harry tate was a comedian who could not cope with modern gadgets and that's where our harry tate came from and yet they are ran called us lily port navy they didn't like us an instance the flotilla leader would go to a cinema shows you see and cause we go on just maybe naval trousers cake shirts flapping open hats on the back of the head and walk up the gangplank and the officer they watch us to go white where in hell did you come from once told me you know gone and where dishing jib say you had a great deal of freedom then more than are much more we weren't so bad you know if if need be we were smart if you know what i mean but normally we were doing a job and we soon learnt from the fisherman had originally started that job you know you're free and easy really skipper much the same co bringing back the ship we had a ran shelby and for no reason it he'd put you in she's report for anything and we go to the skipper who sent you so and so i get he never got in trouble give me a field for the ship had a harman did he have oh armauer am i'm i'm i'm doobarbora to me i can do the rome the rome had a twelve pounder forehead an ordicon portstarboard and a point five on the stern i mean point five we just will throw rocks at em really they wasted time anyway that was loves romel she had a m de charge thrower pop starboard and rolled off on the stern and of marlborough up front she had a four inch gun great big massive gun she had a orricans are portstarbard and behind a stack stern and we once again sobers port starboard and roll off dep charges and you know we're fretted this one was fitted with anti shamari detection and no we didn't have the other one aircraft thing that that came later on the wall borough and it's great fun really we could see all sorts of things that we couldn't see before coast lines and tina that you know what was this equipment and radar radar we we didn't have that originally but that night came in afterwards it was very handy around the greek islands because when the war finished we were rolling about may do in all sorts of our jobs and that was very useful could you tell me then er with your training over your first deployment your first operational deployment er er where was that and what were you doing operational after we got to the med alexandria was our base a it was just a man or waiting for a ship and and the first ship was the romeo and on on the romeo we were escorted from alex sandri out to the atlantic where the atlantic convoys took over and it was on her and that we did to sicily invasion but romeo had seen better days she was on on the way up to sicily invasion we broke down and now we're sitting in the bed and skipper want silence because the engine over fitting a can member what it was they would do something to do with the boiler we had to blow the boiler down and no steam and on the other but the noise coming up from the fetters they say and how we got away with it i don't know i really don't know but we did and an caught up with a convoy and found you know we joined some more across to augusta harbour and not a happy place for us we we had to blow the boilers again you see to the boilers and we laid opposite the boom no steam couldn't move and mister hitler decided he'd have a go and they were dropping him all over we just missed either side we added we missed it but what was this as bombs aircraft yes yes yes yes yes he he didn't like us being there and anyone else we say you know he really had a cold that night and then on the tuna we heard this saying come out a enemy torpedo boats we're trying to have a go at the boom we torpedoes were right opposite we were happy this is the boom descends rather harlan than that year and we weren't too happy if i e to put one through that net we were right and did but no one from there we had to go cross the malta and get a mini fit and of course they were getting it as well weren't they oh i've nothing but respect for the maltese people i buried them how they put up that day after day after day it it really was terrible we it was so bad bad they told us to stand down because the shrapnel coming down from the guns which was like rain on the deck and that great big pieces like the size of a two and lay it on your deck you heard it coming down is this in any letter or yes in in the harbor and the laser ye we tied alongside a no the convoy that saved walter am i never remember the name but anyway as a tanker ohio got in there with her oil but then she she was sitting on the bottom and we tied alongside her as a birth not knowing anything about at the time but you know since i've read about it i've a lot of feeling for that ship and to some any one that's not served i don't think can understand the feeling you do have to ship you really do it's it's your home and i suppose the thing i missed most when i came out was the comradeship that you do miss it you really do anyway i changed change ships when when he went romeo got back to alex she had to go in for a proper refit and we came off then that was the last i saw of her but now the romeo was quite unique actually her bow turned to starboard because a telemotor the control to steering broke down as she was entering harbour and just inside the harbor was the spaceship who had a commodore aboard you see and we rammed it i wasn't there and the romeo rammed it and she had a bent she had a bet bow which made her a bitch to steer oh she was she really was you know you they allowed you ten degrees either side the compass point but she would go on if you didn't watch her and when you were escorting convoys what sort of separation was there between chips oh quite a distance we were sweeping we would sweep it depends where we were usually a quarter we were on a quarter of a convoy the bigger ships were up forward on on mine and we would sweep at forty five degrees either side you know and you had it at the start they gave you the compass reading and they just told you on the next act turn over and he didn't need to give you you knew it so were you in visual contact with the other vessels yes oh yes you could we won't close shall we not that close you a point us really wouldn't it at night charm or even daytime actually all you had was slits in front of you to see you know it that it was armored plate put there with your slits you couldn't see anything just a compass at night time that's all you could see what would that be about four and a half five inches square roughly and you're looking up at it so up above your eye level and that's all you could see it was quite an ice train and you can imagine you do fall on and fall off minus the dogs and change and you were tired you really did get tired and you could sleep anywhere and i've actually fell asleep at the wheel we we had a seat behind the big steering wheel and a little small wheel to steer with and i've fallen asleep there at night time got blasted mind from up above yes where the hell are you going to come back nose or you've always got to have the answer he wasn't let them let them know they knew they knew obvious but i was always loud ones or ran wouldn't arm would never allow we even our rum rationed that was neat we had neat rum whereas the navy was at three four to one at ted convoys close up at night no no we kept station as it was we sweep away from the convoy in a back you know that's on the quarter when there's one on the stern doing the same thing two on each quarter and depend on the sides you might have one in the middle but you know not in the middle of combo on the outside your escorts are always on have charge of convoys
