when you was down in deal obviously that you know were you seeing a lot of the battle of britain no we didn't see a thing i mean that was a i don't even know when the battle of britain was but i mean we didn't see much of that at all the only thing i do remember was that there was a german sea plane with red cross markings and i know that there was a submarine in the channel and it fired at a ship just of deal with two torpedoes and the torpedoes missed the ship hit the beach and jumped up onto the beach and we were taken down there on guard in case anybody got near them but other than that saw very little action there until we got to plymouth ok so you got to plymouth do you know you're going to be on the prince of wales at this point and what was it like when you suddenly saw that ship for the first time and you knew that was what was going to be no not until you'd finished training and they were detailing off a hundred and eighty royal marines to be the detachment of the battleship prince of wales and it was then that about twenty five of our squad were all detailed off to be part of the hundred and eighty detachment royal marines for the prince of wales that was ok we all organised a train from devonport with all our kit on was straight through too liverpool and a was it liverpool yes liverpool cause it was liverpool because the prince of wales was built in cammell laird in birkenhead and when we got to the docks the dock place in birkenhead it was stowing then i'm sorry if i said earlier it was summer it wasn't it was snowing it was snowing like a so and so and we marched from birkenhead railway station to cammell lairds dockyard and we formed up on the quay and we could see this ship laying over slightly onto the quayside and through the snow it only looked like a cruiser or a destroyer and to our amazement the sgt major came down and detailed us off and we marched aboard to our respective mess decks and the reason the prince of wales was laying over at a slight angle was that the germans had been bombing and they dropped a bomb between the prince of wales and the dockside which was ten feet the bomb missed the prince of wales went down into the water and exploded and blew loose one of the plates near the boiler room in the prince of wales which flooded her and she was laying over at an angle that was the first thing of the who do that the prince of wales was i was going to say when you saw that and you found that out i mean you know must have been exciting going onto the ship for the first time but did you have a sense that there was a who do no no no it was just one of those things well its war and it happened we were darn lucky that it didn't hit the ship itself and a the bomb hit the ship itself and make a big mess it made enough mess as it was had you been on a ship at this point before no no so tell me what was it like leaving liverpool well birkenhead then i was detailed off to be at this time i wasn't qualified at anything except as a plain royal marine but i was detailed off in the navy or any ships passing another ship merchant ship and that you lower the white ensign and the ship lowers there ensign in recognition if the ship didn't lower its ensign then you went for her and i was in the aft lowering the ensign cold and freezing job but it was one of those things until we got to scapa we got to scapa and we would sent into the dock in scapa and repaired and then of course it was training part of the training churchill wanted to go to america and meet roosevelt and the prince of wales was destined for it and we took churchill across to america to meet roosevelt what was the you know when you're on a ship obviously now there's a completely new set of training can you talk a bit about some of the you know intensive training that you'd of been going through as she was you know almost shake down trials it so happens that being a brand new ship they was short of gunnery and artificers and machinists and things like that and they went through the crew records and of course my record showed that i'd been in the machine shops and in the industry prior to joining the royal marines and so i was detailed to go down to the machine shop we had a beautiful machine shop down on the prince of wales and met the chief petty officer and i can still see it now he questioned me then he gave me a piece of machine and said here you are boy make that and i'd hardly got the metal into the lathe he said you know what you're doing your duty is here so when the royal marines were on parade i was excused duties because i was in the machine shop the chief petty officer of the machine shop said that we were at war the ship had to be brought up to full fighting standard and therefore i was to remain in the machine shop while the rest of the royal marines were on parade was that a good thing or a bad thing for you oh no it was a good thing because i mean it meant to say that half past three of an afternoon four o'clock was evening quarters half past three you had to go up and redress polish your uniform polish everything to be on parade at four o'clock for the captain marines inspection and as i was as i say down in the there were four of us there was three working in the gun turret and i was in the machine shop and we was excused those duties so we used to carry on there what was it like being below deck when you were first night sailing were you seasick i was seasick for the first day and then after that my body seemed to of acclimatised and so i wasn't seasick after that i mean going across the atlantic to america i mean we had a pretty rough time but i seemed to settle down and i was alright i mean there were other poor devils being terribly seasick and i was walking around quite good ok so after the sea trials you went up to skapa is that right yes what were you doing up there and what was the experience of being up there like commonly known in the royal navy as swinging round the buoy' we were just anchored in skapa just doing normal training you know aboard ship while we were anchored until such time we were ordered to accompany the hood the bismarck was out and we were ordered with the hood the battleship hood to chase her and fight her and that was when the hood got a shell in the magazine from the bismarck and blew up and sunk and we got a fourteen inch shell from the bismarck which landed i can't remember how it was very close to our rear magazine if that had exploded it happened to be a dud but if it had of exploded the prince of wales would have blown up as well but that was the number two of the who do of the prince of wales
