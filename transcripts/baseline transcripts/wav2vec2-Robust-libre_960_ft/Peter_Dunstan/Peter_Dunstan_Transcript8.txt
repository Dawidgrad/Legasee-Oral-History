you've got to man pong and you know do you remember what your impressions are where what what was happening is oh yes yes i i've i've i've got very very close association let me say i'm church of england this is about a catholic mission now in bam pong there's a church and today a school where they educate two and a half thousand boys and two and a half thousand girls and when we walked from the trucks that we were in order to get out in ban pong we had to pass this catholic mission just a small church and that and alongside the road there were baskets of fruit and baskets of eats of all sorts and there was a catholic priest in white because we were walking past the day he was there telling us please you take you take and we walked about half a mile to a compound where we were made to stay as the first part of the prison war now when i first went back having memories of this food and this priest i went back and i found this mission i found actually the priest and he left it and left italy as a boy of seventeen as a missionary priest and he lived there all his life he came to england he was going to italy and he came to england he stayed in this house with me and he was one of the most marvellous people you could ever have a he he served saved a lot of lot of lives with the work that he did the prisoners war and after after we we got to this am what i pay of school is that it's a buddhist school we were put into this compound and then after so many days a which it was in the flood season of out of the area and i know that the compound was part flooded in water so we were living in water part of the time and then the japanese they crowded us into japanese lorries we were one of a fortune i was one of the fortunate lot we were taken from bampong to cancunabery which is the where the bridge of the room acquires by japanese lorries albeit we were crowded like sardines in a tin but i was still we didn't have to walk all the other poor devils had to walk the a fifty miles that it is now and when did you know what you were sort of doing and what i mean what was the day to day work and now existence like uh oh you just you used to bite the japanese because the japanese well the men it was mainly koreans and on that part had during the japanese chinese war that the japanese had battalions of koreans in china when the chinese attacked the the koreans ran so the japanese never put the koreans into the front line again but they put him in charge of us prisoners of war so the japanese were baking the koreans and the koreans were beating us and some of those koreans after the war they they met the hangman from the treatment they gave us at a when we got to kent an abra again i was one of the fortunate lot we will put on the barges and as you say you've been to thailand and you've seen the the river barges that run on there on the river and we were crowding into those sitting on the top of a rice which we finally found out was to be our ration because every night we used to they used to stop and unload so many sacks of rice at that camp and so many rice at the camp i know it was i think it was about four days we were on the river kwai if you've been there you've been to the the river kwai village hotel yes i haven't been to that oh well the river pie village hotel is a beautiful little how jelly if you ever go back that is on the river bank and the camp that i was in was at the top of the hill where the there is a a a a what do you call it when i win water bubbles out of the out of the as a spring there's a spring at the top of the hill and that was where our camp was and i drank out of that water and today that water has been docked and adducted down the hillside and if you go to the river coy village hotel it forms part of a waterfall at the back of the hotel and some of the water is diverted for for cooking it's good water at that was that was where we started and we had to start an digging and blasting and cutting the rocks for the for the railway can you remember what you know you talked about some of the koreans met the hammer can you remember some of the mistreatment you got some of the mat maltreatment head that was dished out to oh god you have careers one one particular instant i got up during the night funny how you can remember some of these things am i mean the huts we were living in were bare and were were a bamboo and a palm leaf roofs and where we slept slept was split bamboo a platforms about eighteen inches off the ground we had no no bedding or anything like that you just slept slept on on the bare bamboo and i got up this night to go to the toilet and this buddy japanese what was it what was he was the mad mad mad mangle the med monge he was a right so and so big bloke and whenever you pass any of these guards you'll let it stop and bow to them and of course i was diving for the toilet and as i came out he caught up with me and bashed me two or three times i never forgot that so and so i know he was one of those that went for the chop after the war but the the koreans because they were being beaten by the japanese they took it on out on us and there were quite a number of japan koreans that got to exterminate it after the war for war crimes did you ever try an escape there was no need there was no possible chance we were we were in the the jungle now there's no food in the jungle is only wild animals or snakes i mean pythons up to about twitty thirty feet long monkeys there was the rations you were given there was no way you could you could survive you didn't know where you were we we knew we were by the river the river kwai that was about as far as we knew where were we we didn't know how far burma was we didn't know how far how where the japanese were or anything else it was there was no way there were two or three tried to escape a they were come they were caught finally by the japanese and executed because they are they tried to escape the japanese but there were just nothing you could do how do you keep up your moral ah i can't tell you he just sees carried on you sort of lived in a twilight world that was it if you could scrounge anything if you pinch anything ah that you did it not from your mates from from the koreans of the japanese i mean they were they were the target i mean i am in the last camp now this is after the railway was finished and i was for the last year i was down in a railway repair workshop the jap male jape cari think they were japs at this time guards we the first thing we had to do was to build a and to dig a trench and it was nine feet wide seven feet deep with a slope on the inside and all the soil was piled on the outside so therefore the outside was what ten ten feet high at which was to stop us from escaping
