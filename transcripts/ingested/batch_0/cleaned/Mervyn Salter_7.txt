that must have been a welcome respite after the arctic certainly warm yes indeed yes indeed it was different but then it was a completely different setup as you say all together we got involved in a few skirmishes in the andaman sea's couple of those one of them a japanese ship was sunk and we picked up five women survivors five japanese and about fifty to fifty plus chose to swim away trust their lives with the sharks rather than be picked up and they were so fanatic that on another occasion we sank a submarine chaser and that ship was going down stern first the master was climbing the mast with an automatic gun firing aimlessly into the sky and of course he just went down with the ship these were the sorts of things you had with the japanese you just couldn't tell what was going to happen next can you just describe the rescue process for somebody who doesn't know how it operates because it's unusual in the arctic you wouldn't really do it would you no no no so what was the process well you just had a scrambling net over the side and they had to climb a scrambling net and when they got up you'd lift them over the top what was it like to suddenly see japanese women climbing over these nets well they were not japanese actually indonesian one was an indian but they were more of the islands rather than japanese they were obviously for the comfort of the japanese so they were basically slaves sex slaves absolutely yes and what do you do with prisoners of war i mean what happens next the ladies of course we put them to good use because we had several days before we got back into port and er they did all our dobeying for us which was very helpful i wondered what you were going to say then yes the japanese of course we had a constant guard over them all the time but the five that we had just accepted that they were prisoners and that was it on one of the other boats one of the japanese actually committed suicide we learned again as i say you just couldn't say what was going to happen next the next thing that we er how do i describe this for you we didn't come off best explaining again our captain was intent on becoming an admiral and therefore he was looking all the time seeking things so we pulled into stewart sound in the nicobar islands and we were accompanied by rapid hms rapid and hms volage we left rapid at the mouth of the sound volage came halfway and saumarez went all the way up a winding stream as it were until we came to this island we were looking for shipping there was none there instead there was a six inch gun on this island when we came to it we were passing it we could see the japanese being awaked from their siesta running to man their gun but they couldn't get a range on us so we we were lucky in that way otherwise we would have been blown out of it all together how far away were you fifty hundred yards it was that close as you say it was like a winding river i suppose type of thing you know obviously anyway we received a message that the rapid had been hit so we turned back and retreated back down the the sound and took the rapid in tow a sight that was rather frightening she'd been hit the er her lookin' crew were like wax dolls at their gun obviously killed by the blast there was only one survivor on the deck ex gun had a direct hit and there were limbs legs and arms on the deck as i say it was all all scary to look at you know i think they lost thirty six in all and we took her in tow volage meantime was also pulled back from halfway and was making smoke to protect us and we pulled out into the main andaman sea and rapid was unable to make her own way under her own steam and we accompanied her to in burma where obviously you transfer all the wounded and the dead to hospitals and what have you there again we didn't have time to think about these things next thing we were sailing again and this was now to rangoon capital of burma which we were retaking we were only there for four or five days because the troops ashore had made so much progress there was not much for the navy to do so we pulled back and returned to trincomalee
