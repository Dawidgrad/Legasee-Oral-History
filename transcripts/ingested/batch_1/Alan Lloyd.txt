my name is alan lloyd i joined the navy as an artificer apprentice and retired after twenty four years' service in nineteen seventy nine as a chief petty officer or a radio electrical artificer first class i was born and raised in nottingham from where i joined the navy and apart from my parents being there it was probably the last time i lived in the city beyond that naval establishments and anywhere else that i happen to find work when was that when i left the navy no when you joined i joined the navy in nineteen fifty five to be an artificer there is a five year apprenticeship so that the upper age limit for it was sixteen years and eight months when i went in of course your man's time didn't start until you were eighteen so twenty two years on top of that i came out in nineteen seventy nine when i was forty years old but to a pension of course why did you join the navy for the same reason a lot of people do i suppose i was looking for something different as far as a job went and when i was at school i went to grammar school which was one side of nottingham and i lived the other side of nottingham and every morning getting the bus over i used to see this long line of the same faces not very happy shall we say and i thought this is not going to be for me my father was in the army but that didn't interest me it was the travel i suppose side of it so the navy seemed the ideal solution i went into the careers recruiting office in nottingham i was young enough for them to say i could go for the apprenticeship which gave me a complete skill in those days it was a full five year apprenticeship so yes mainly for the variety the travel how did you find the transition from civilian life as a young boy into that naval apprenticeship no problem at all i mean i went straight from school to work i mean it applies to any sort of thing had i gone to an office in nottingham or into a factory it was from an education environment to working environment what about the discipline then that was something i got used to i knew there was going to be discipline i coped with it it didn't bother me i didn't resent the discipline side of it so no problem as far as that went so what did you train to do then tell me a bit about your training naval apprentices the artificers are the engineers the specialists basically you have got the engine room side of it engineers who deal with the ship's propulsion systems engine's and such the electrical people who deal with the ship's electronics radio again self explanatory radar that side of it ordinance weaponry gunnery and such and then within the fleet air arm you have got an equivalent of people specializing in aircraft radar and radio plus electronics aircraft engines aircraft armament etc so they are the specialists the engineers so you get grounding across all of those do you when you joined up you are an artificer apprentice you spend the first sixteen months at a place called hms fisgard which is at torpoint in cornwall and you are all apprentice there where you did a basic training in metalwork woodwork there was also school classes for further education like gces things like that a term was about four months three times a year and so in the final term you were then assessed and put into your own specialist group whether you are going to be electrical or you are going to be ordinance or you were going to be engineering the rest of the apprenticeship was training in the environment you are going to be working in and in different parts of the country the engineers went to hms caledonia which was in scotland the electrical people and the radio people to hms collingwood which was in fareham and you well i went to collingwood as a radio electrical engineer the aircraft people went to arbroath in scotland now the electrical side then stayed together within the electrical category but with no division between be air and the ground side until the eighth term and then you were re categorised whether you are going to be specialising in the ship electronics or aircraft electronics i got put into the air side so i did the last three terms which was a year at the air electrical school which was a place called hms ariel which is outside worthy down i believe it is now an army establishment with the royal army pay corps there so basically i spent the apprenticeship started at fisgard then went at collingwood and then finished training four years later and went out into the fleet for the fifth year hands on i then went to a shore establishment it was the royal naval air station at lossiemouth where i spent about six months there getting a good grounding of all aspects of an air station because again although i say aircraft radio and radar on air station you have got ground radio equipment as well so you are doing both sides of the fence i then got moved from scotland down to a place called hms goldcrest near haverfordwest in brawdy where i spent a couple of years there good to start off and then the place closed down while they lengthened and strengthened the runway although they very much depleted the ships company they were still a few people left around but honestly not really enough to keep you occupied you can do nothing for so long this categorisation and splitting people that i told you he found out that they had actually channelled far too many people into the air side of the electronics world than the ship's side and they had got an imbalance so they came out through fleet orders asking for air people like myself to do a commission on the ship side on board but it would be on an aircraft carrier so i then went to hms centaur working on the ships radio equipment radar etc for two years so that was my first ship how was that that was ok i mean naval shore establishments are ok but it is the transition to the closed world of a ship is when you get your first taste of the navy proper you have got the ships company there somewhere between about one thousand five hundred to one thousand six hundred people almost a small village basically exactly the same some people are sleeping some people are working some people are relaxing etc yes it is a big change you are partially prepared for it i enjoyed it it must have been a magnificent feeling walking the gangplank a beast as big as that i don't know a little bit of what the hell is going to happen from here but yes it was easy to get into the rhythm of things i don't think i had any particular problems apart from just learning what life at sea was like i mean how do you find your way round something as big as an aircraft carrier to start with from your work your recreation getting used to the various routines although a ship in peace time is not fighting in any force you are training for the eventuality of war so what you are doing basically is rehearsing and rehearsing in the case of an aircraft carrier flying your aircraft sending them out bombing things like that and you providing the back up i joined her in nineteen sixty two halfway through a commission in fact she had just come back from the middle east the first of the dust ups with kuwait when a guy called kassim was trying to take over the country i joined her just towards the end of that commission and again i suppose it was an ease in because we were within uk waters i got as far as visiting hamburg on her at that particular time she was the first carrier to visit hamburg the first british aircraft carrier since the second world war so quite a bit of publicity lots of people coming out to see the ship and things like that she then went into a refit that was sort of a major overhaul that i got involved in then yes when she had finished that we first did a trip into the mediterranean gibraltar malta marseilles and that was about it then we came back for another short maintenance period and then we went to the far east so basically as far as i was concerned it broke me in with the travelling i did a short hop i did at middle one and then the last bit was out singapore and the farthest i got was hong kong i didn't get to australasia i didn't get to japan but it's a big world how were your sea legs did you how to any rough rides going out towards the pacific that is a big ocean just getting used to the movement of the ship for a start an aircraft carrier for some reason will centaur did it and so did the ark don't just tip like that she used to pick up in an arc and then drop right down so you are living with that continual motion all the time you just get used to it you don't notice it after a while the mess deck that i was in on the centaur was mid ships about three four five decks down so that i could hear the thump with the aircraft flying it was just something that was going on my job was looking after the radio ship side not getting involved with the aircraft if we hit a storm or anything like that the only thing it does is make you very very tired after a couple of days of being bounced around shall we say it's wearing on you and as i said to you anybody who suffers from seasickness has my deepest sympathy it must be awful when you crossed the equator did they look after you i did indeed i have still got my crossing the line certificate it was yes i id cross it on the centaur because we were on our way down to mombasa which is just south of the equator oh yes with the full trappings neptune coming on board with his court and the mermaids and all the rest of it the newbies all being dunked etc yes it was a great social day anything like that on board a ship that gets a change away from routine you can specifically plan if the flight deck is clear aircraft aren't flying so ok open it up and you've got a hockey field up there for a start all various other types of sport so crossing the line was one of the biggest ones i still remember it anyway it was a great day and how was centaur at a ship you have served on a few was it a good ship was it a happy ship i don't honestly think i had a bad one it was very very lucky the people i was working with i got on with very very well mess deck i was in a petty officers mess it was a mixed mess you've got people in different trades to yourself we only had a small mess deck only eighteen nineteen of us we got on very well as a group i found it extremely happy the only time it wasn't we had a dreadful accident on centaur i joined her in the june time and we were in the irish sea somewhere off the isle of man and there was a leakage of steam in the boiler room super heated steam which is hot and regrettably five people actually lost their lives in that accident not that apparently they would have still a chance anyway they were in a confined compartment steam pipe burst and basically that was it i don't think i ever would like to be in that situation there was an atmosphere throughout the ship when that happened i suppose because the ship gives you a kindredship all of the same esprit de corps call it what you like what had happened to them affected everybody else within the ship and i think in a way it probably helped the people who were closely involved to cope with it is that the worst accident you have ever had in a ship yes it was i mean the occasional aircraft unfortunately had a heavy landing we had one went off missed the wire and went off into the sea and sank those funnily enough seem to be more remote i don't know why there was something like the accident in the boiler room everybody was involved in that we had a guy in the mess deck who was in that boiler room and when they broadcast what had happened practically everybody in the mess looked at his bunk it was about six o'clock in the morning when we all found out and thankfully he was in there it is a difficult thing to put into words is very much esprit de corps which i think is prevalent in the navy so after you had been on the centaur what was your next ship i then went ashore again i went to the royal naval air station at yeovilton which is down in somerset and having come from working on the ships electronics i then went into the ground radio department at yeovilton in other words maintaining the big stuff the transmitters i'd been working on board ship or a variation of them they had buccaneers they had sea vixens were the main aircraft they had there and gannets i was in the workshop looking after ground radio equipment and getting the aircraft equipment when something went wrong with it and it could not be fixed site then the unit was taken out and brought to the workshop and then you would repair strip it down completely and hopefully repair it or get it down to a level where you can i mean not like today's computers where you just unplug and plug in a new board i mean i'm talking about things like valves and resistors and such stuff were you could get down to component level and change them and that was basically an eight nine until five job monday to friday for most people are you always had a skeleton staff in because quite often he would be flying on a saturday from the airfield so he would need to the staff in there did you ever do any work that would then cause problems bad work that caused problems thankfully no it was something you were always worried especially if it was a piece of equipment that was going in an aircraft not so bad as if an engine's stops the aircraft is going to fall out and the sky then but if the radio equipment goes down it is still going to cause problems and especially if i think what you are more worried is that it's not a stupid mistake you made if you had thought about it you were responsible for it i had about a year doing that now naval establishments have a naafi and most of them like the air station have an all ranks club within the establishment which is run by a committee consisting of a senior rate a chief petty officer and representatives from throughout the station who run the club there is a bar a small restaurant arranging dances social functions than getting the ladies in from outside the area how i wound up with it i am not quite certain but i was asked to take over the chairmanship of that club i had a year there as the club manager trying to arrange the functions arrange the groups running meetings is trying to provide the things that the ships company wanted to be done in the club what do you mean by ladies from out of town i mean an air station you have got far more fellas you've got a few wrens there so if you are going to have a dance the sailors have got a have someone to dance with so there are quite a few of the girls from the surrounding area came in for when we had a dance they were always good do's anyway we normally got a decent group in fact i seem to remember one of my biggest mistakes there was a group around about that time just starting called dave dee dosey beakey mitch and titch something like that i mean they weren't even a name then they were just on circuit and i was offered them for about nineteen pounds fifty for a gig and i turned them down and look at what they went on to later on if ladies from ashore sounds a bit derogatory a quite a lot of them let's face it did probably turn into romances no i chucked that in because in april nineteen sixty six i got married and i figured that my future bride was not going to take kindly to me being out every night until midnight on certainly three or four nights a week when there were socials i had got a committee there i worked on the principle that if we had something on i was always in the club anyway making sure that everything was alright plus the fact is something had gone wrong i could give a first hand report to the ships commander so that he knew exactly what had happened and i figured that she wasn't well it wasn't the ideal thing being newly married so i quit that we got married in the april and about two months later got a draft and that's when i went out to singapore to the raf station at changi the navy had what was called the naval aircraft support unit at the raf station the job was to maintain types of each aircraft in the far east so that if the carrier was east of suez in serious damage to an aircraft damage to the airframe or something like that it couldn't fly what they would do they would offloaded to us on a one for one basis we would give them a replacement to keep their numbers up and then we would get it back to air worthiness so that it was ready next time another one came in that was broken and we did a one for one swap there so most of the time was in that fourth line servicing the in depth servicing of the aircraft but if there were carriers in singapore pilots have to keep their flying hours up to what they used to do was put this squadrons ashore at the raf station and they would then do their flying from there we will provide backup for the aircraft to keep them flying while the carriers were in so they would two types in the long periods when we get and how carriers around it would be in depth maintenance repair stuff like that it was back up and keeping aircraft flying over the couple weeks or so fort when the carriers were a in and i was there for about two and a half years so living and messing in the raf establishment so another complete change another a different service environment another way of life in fact i suppose to a certain extent quite a few places in my career i have strayed off the normal career progress of an electronics engineer into little diversion like that and again i found it very interesting of course living ashore in somewhere like singapore a place i'd never been to one thing we did do although there were married quarters out there we actually hired a bungalow which was amongst the local singaporeans so our neighbours were people who were born and raised on the island so we got to make some very good friends some of whom i' still in contact with the highlight of the visit was we arrived in october nineteen sixty six and in december nineteen sixty seven our son was born in changi hospital so he has got two birth certificates from there back to back to brawdy down in wales but it was only a short stop i had a couple of months leave to take with having been abroad for so long and the day after i joined brawdy i was given a draft which was sending me to the ark royal later on that year so i only had about two or three months at brawdy before i went down to plymouth ark was in the dockyard at the time i joined her she was in the middle of a three million pounds three year refit which was causing an awful lot of stir in the press especially a guy at the express called chapman pincher who was having a go at the wastage of money the government wasted expense etc she finished the refit i joined her in nineteen sixty nine she finished the refit at the beginning of seventy and i stayed with her until november seventy two did you want to join the ark royal was she the pride of the fleet then ark royal was the fleet carrier she was very good publicity i mean shortly after i left her the bbc producers that series sailor that twelve part series when we were on her the bbc did a programme on her off portland in lyme bay which was the first totally live outside broadcast ark was involved a royal fleet auxiliary other ships as well and they didn't lose a break in transmission throughout the whole hour of that documentary mind you they rehearsed enough before the programme went out so anything like that ark was normally at the forefront as far as publicity was concerned the queen mum launched ark royal the third one that i'm talking about she came down and for the commissioning ceremony and she always shown an interest in the ship so that gave you a link with it as well did you as a naval person want to join ark royal i had no choice i got a draft to her i was going you can volunteer for something like singapore i volunteered for that i thought no way and damn me i got it within three or four months of putting the request in the draft that i got to ark was just a routine draft you will join her on such and such in time and how was that after being ashore for some time thinking back to your return to the ocean how did you find ark royal she was bigger than centaur she had two five hundred ships company but no a ship is a ship basically the routines the system the day to day procedures were exactly the same did you enjoying being back on a ship then yes didn't miss home didn't miss wife well obviously married son that was just over a year old when we flew back from singapore so growing rapidly and changing quite a lot yes unfortunately but that is a fact of service life or certainly with the navy my attitude is that i went into the navy voluntary it's part of the job i did not perhaps like it but it is something i have got to accept i mean my wife kept sending me photographs and obviously letters and so forth so i kept up to date that way and thankfully when we were abroad it was for three or four months something like that and then coming back so i wasn't losing a whole year or anything like that which probably make it a bit easier but no i saw it as it went with the job are there any incidents that you recall from ark royal either favourably or not so favourably things that stand out from that service period the first bit of it was a work up after the big refit so we were in home waters a trip back to liverpool that's miles away ark was built there good publicity again to take her back to the city she was built in oslo was another trip while we were doing the work up from then we had another mediterranean tour sort of thing building like last time although i didn't exactly plan it that way but this time the highlight was that i managed to get states side on board ark royal we went to fort lauderdale in florida up to jacksonville i mean i don't know if it was a coincidence or not but the captain's wife actually came from ft lauderdale so maybe that's why the trip over there and that was great america is a place everyone wants to go and see some of your travel experiences obviously have born you great joy what made life difficult for you was there any difficult things was there any moments you think god i've had enough i don't want to be in or on the ship personal ones probably both my mother and my father passed away when i was abroad and there were difficulties getting me home in time because i'm an only one and getting home in time to go to the funeral to get that type of closure but thankfully on both occasions i did make it the other one was while i was on ark my wife got pregnant with our second child and regrettably lost him at about seven months again i was abroad at the time so and that one i didn't get home for unfortunately but as far as the life itself went i enjoyed it i was lucky in the people i met ok there were one or two obnoxious sods on a ship that big don't have to associate with them in a submarine it might have been slightly different what was the skipper like on ark a man by the name of ray lygo extremely fair respected by most of the crew there was a slight incident when he played billiards and a russian destroyer in the mediterranean that got him a bit of unwelcome publicity funnily enough i wasn't on the ship at the time i was at home for my mother's funeral something like a carrier in those days always had in the vicinity when it was operating either a russian fishing vessel sprouting with masses of aerials and all the rest of it for a russian in fact it was a kaitlin class destroyer if i remember correctly when she was flying what the ship used to do was cruise alongside ark watching what was going on then drop astern and then come up on the other side to keep watching obviously this is all secondhand as i wasn't there but apparently one night instead of dropping astern actually pulled ahead and tried to cross arks bows and don't make it she stayed afloat but it put a whacking great hole in the stern of her i think they lost a couple of seamen who went overboard and they didn't recover them when i joined the navy i was part of the largest intake of artificers that the navy ever took there were two hundred and twenty of us which was a hell of a lot we have even got our own little subsection within the fisgard association how did you see feel when you had to leave then why did you leave i had to after twenty two years man's time that starts from where you're eighteen i had to retire at forty that is when i went to pension the only way i could have stayed was had there been a shortfall in my particular job category and then you could stay for another five to make it up but if that didn't happen then i had to go to retirement at forty and probably i was ready for it by then i'll admit that although i still love travelling to finally settle into a home environment and not being away for weeks at the time or months at a time that was what i think i was ready to do it didn't happen but that's another story and so the of overriding memory of your time in the navy is very positive very positive indeed if there was anything bad i've blotted it out why dwell on it move forward with the positive
