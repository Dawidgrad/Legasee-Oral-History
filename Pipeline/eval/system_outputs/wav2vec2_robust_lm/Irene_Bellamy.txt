MY NAME IS IRENE BELLAMY I READ JUST WHERE ARE YOU FROM I WAS FROM BRISTOL FROM THE FISH PONDS AREA WHERE I WAS BORN AND I WENT TO SCHOOL IN BRISTOL AND STARTED MY WORK AFTER SCHOOL IN BRISTOL HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN WAR BROKE WELL I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN NINETEEN TIMES TWENTY WHAT WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE YOU IN BRISTOL AND YOU WERE A TO A BIT OF MY SCHOOLING AND AND AND DISLIKE BRITS UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE AM I ORIGINALLY WENT TO A SMALL PRIVATE SCHOOL AM AND THEN WENT TO COLSTON FROM THERE AND A BRISTOL ITSELF I FOUND RATHER DULL YOU KNOW IT WAS ALL PUBS AND CHURCHES THAT'S HOW IT SEEMED TO ME YOU KNOW THERE WEREN'T THE THE FUN THINGS THAT THERE ARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY AM WE SPENT MOST OF OUR TIME EITHER GOING TO THE OUR FREE TIME GOING TO THE SINO AND OR PLAYING SOME KIND OF GAMES YOU KNOW I BELONGED TO NO VARIOUS HOCKEY TEAMS AND TENNIS CLUBS AND AND AND DURING DURING THE WAR AM BECAUSE WE WORKED VERY LONG HOURS AND AT EIGHT SO THAT YOU WEREN'T LOOKING FOR YOU MUCH LEISURE FUN AND I MOVED BECAUSE OF THE BRISTOL BITS DURING THAT TIME AND I WAS PUT BY THE FIRM THEY DIDN'T WANT US IN THE DANGER OF CENTRAL BRISTOL AND SO ON AND SO THEY TOOK OVER A COTTAGE IN SHIFTING SUDBURY AND I LIVED IN SHIPS IN SUDBURY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS A THAT WAS QUITE GOOD FUN AT THE SORT OF VILLAGE LIFE LOTS GOING ON BUT I'D ALWAYS HAD A END TO GO INTO THE NAVY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT MAINLY BECAUSE I HAD FRIENDS WHO HAD JOINED THE SERVICES AND WHOSE EXQUISITE REINS OVER ANY OTHER SERVICE YES I DIDN'T WANT TO JOIN YOU MEAN ENOUGH FOR ITS OR NO NO NO MY PARTICULAR FRIEND WENT INTO THE WAR AND SHE HAD A VERY INTERESTING TIME AS OUT IN WASHINGTON A WORKING FOR ME NOT MABEL THE AIR FORCE THE RED WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE YES YES LIKE THE UNIFORM TO JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YATES AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE AND UNDERSTATE THE WORK AND STUFF A WELL AM AS SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF DESIGNER IN THE BEGINNING AND IT WAS A QUESTION OF DOING A TYPING HE WOULD DICTATE HIS DESIGN REPORTS BECAUSE IT HAD ALL HAD TO GO UP TO THE AIR MINISTRY FOR APPROVAL BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR AN ORDER FOR THESE PLANES OF COURSE AND IT WAS TYPING ALL THESE SHEETS OF DESCRIPTION OF THESE PLANES AM AND THAT I MEAN TO SAY HE WAS A VERY UNDISCIPLINED MAN IN THAT HE LEFT EVERYTHING TO THE LAST MINUTE SO ONE WAS WORKING QUITE LATE AT NIGHT VERY OFTEN TO GET IT DONE TO THE DEADLINE THAT THE MINISTRY HAD SET IN BASEL HENDERSON AND HE DESIGNED A SMALL PLAYING CALLED THE EM WHAT DID THEY CALL IT THE HENDY IT WAS A BREAKDOWN OF HIS NAME BUT IT WAS BASIL HEN AM IT'LL COME TO ME BUT IT WAS A ROUND ABOUT THE TIME THAT THERE WAS A ANOTHER CHAP DESIGNING THOSE SMALL PLANES AM I CAN'T THINK OF HIS NAME NOW BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THE WAR WAS COMING AM NOT REALLY NO I MEAN TO SAY THAT THE BOYS THAT WE USED TO MEET AND MIX WITH WE WERE MOSTLY AIRFORCE TYPES OR GOING INTERESTED IN THE AIR FORCE AND WE KNEW THERE WAS A LITTLE FIVE O ONE SQUADRON THE AT FILTON AM THAT MOST OF THEM FLEW WITH AND WE KNEW AT TIMES THAT FROM THEIR CONVERSATION THAT THINGS WERE GETTING VERY NEAR BUT NOT REALLY YOU KNOW NOT YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T PUTTING OUT THE BARRICADES OR ANYTHING WHAT ABOUT THE OUTBREAK OF WAR DO YOU REMEMBER THAT I DO AND WE WERE AT ON FILTON AERODROME WE THEN THAT SUNDAY WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED IT WATCHING THESE LADS IN THEIR PLANES TAKING OFF PURELY FOR EXERCISE AND DID THINGS CHANGE IN BRISTOL WHEN WAR BROKE OUT WHAT WAS THE CHANGE YOU REMEMBER I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY BECAUSE MOST OF MY LIFE WAS SPENT BETWEEN FISH PONDS AND YATES YOU KNOW I VERY RARELY WENT THE OTHER WAY TOWARDS TOWN AND DIDN'T REALLY GET ANY FEELING OF WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE EVEN YOU KNOW I READ NOW ABOUT SOME OF THE GHASTLY THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBING YOU KNOW THE LOT OF LIFE BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME DIRECTLY AM MY PARENTS HAD A SHOP IN FISH BONDS AND THEY STILL KEPT GOING YOU KNOW IN A QUIET SORT OF WAY DID YOU SEE THE PLACE YOU SEE WERE YOU IN WERE YOU IN THAT WHEN YES I WAS IN THERE AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FIRM MOVED US TO LIVE IN YET SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BUSINESS OF TRAVELLING BUT WE DID HAVE A DAYLIGHT RAID IN IN YATES AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC AM THEY THEY THEY SENT A SINGLE PLANE AND YOU SEE WE WERE ALL WORKING AWAY QUITE HAPPILY IN THE AIR RAGE I ROOM WENT AND I WAS BEING TAUGHT HOW TO PLAY BRIDGE BY THE FRIEND WHO WENT INTO THE AIR FORCE AND A WE DIDN'T TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE RETIRING AS WE NEVER HAD ANYTHING AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS THE MOST ALMIGHTY EXPLOSION AND THE WHOLE BUILDING SHOOK AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED A SINGLE PLANE HAD COME IN APPARENTLY IT CAME IN FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTHERN FRANCE AREA WHERE THE GERMANS HAD AIRPORT AND HAD FLOWN UP THE BRISTOL CHANNEL TO SOMEWHERE NORTH OF GLOSTER PICKED UP THE RAILWAY LINE AND YET RUNS ALONG THE RAILWAY LINE IF YOU KNOW THE BUILDING AND FLEW DOWN AND DROPPED THIS STRIP OF BOMBS ALONG THE FACTORY FORTUNATELY A COUPLE OF THEM DID GO OFF BUT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SEEING A DEAD BODY BECAUSE I KNEW MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FACTORY BECAUSE OF WHO I WAS WORKING FOR AND ONE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOUSE IN THE INN CHIPPING SOBER WITH A WOMAN CALLED SISTER HOBBS WHO BECAME QUITE WELL KNOWN FOR THE WORK SHE DID IN THAT PLACE AND SHE JUST CAUGHT HOLD OF ME AND SHE SAID COME ON WE'VE GOT TO GO UP TO THE BRICK FACTORY SHE SAID TO IDENTIFY THESE PEOPLE WHO VE BEEN KILLED AND YOU KNOW I WAS TAKEN WHAT OUGHT I IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE THOUGHT IT TWENTY TWO AT TWENTY TWO TO SEE ALL THESE DISINTEGRATED BODIES I HADN'T SEEN A DEAD BODY BEFORE AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC WAS THAT YOU THINK A CATALYST OF THINKING I WANTED TO BECOME A RED NO I DON'T THINK SO NO NO THAT WAS QUIETLY SIMMERING AWAY AND I THINK THE CATALIST IN THE END WAS WHEN MY BOSS MOVED HE WENT TO A FIRM WHICH AGAIN YOU MAY KNOW OF BOOZY AND HAWKS THEY EM HE WASN'T A MUSICIAN OR HE HADN'T MADE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS CAUSE THAT WAS THE JOB THEY DID ORIGINALLY THEY WERE MAKING SPARE PARTS FOR SOME OF OUR GUN TURRETS AND THEY FOUND THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD DESIGN WHAT THEY WANTED AND THEY GOT HIM THEY HAD HUNTED HIM AND WHEN HE LEFT I WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH A PERSON WHO GOT THE JOB AND I THOUGHT I WANT TO MOVE BUT I HAD TO WORK QUITE HARD TO GET INTO THE RENTS BECAUSE OF COURSE I WAS IN RESERVED OCCUPATION AS YOU TO ASK WHATEVER IS I ASSUMED IT WAS A RESERVED OCCUPATION SO YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCEDURE TO GET OUT YES AND THEY WEREN'T THE WRENS WEREN'T OPEN FOR RECRUITMENT ANYHOW AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE BEING A DRAWN I SUPPOSE IS THE WORD FOR THE BY WAR ARTIST A MAN CALLED LEOPOLD FREEDMAN I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RUN TO EARTH SINCE I'VE TRIED BECAUSE HE DID IT LIKE A MURAL OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THE FACTORY AND IT WENT TO THE NASAL AT WHAT ONE IN TRAFALGAR THE NIGHT NASAL ART GALLERY IN IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE A AND I WAS SITTING YOU KNOW WHILE HE WAS DRAWING ME AND TALKING TO HIM AND I SAID I WANTED TO JOIN THE RANDOM THE PROBLEM WAS THERE WERE NO VACANCIES AND I WAS IN A RESERVED OCCUPANT SO HE GAVE ME THE NAME OF A WOMAN AGAIN I'VE FORGOTTEN HER NAME BUT SHE WAS THE HEAD OF THE MINISTRY OF LABOR IN LONDON SO I GO OFF TO LONDON TO SEE THIS WOMAN AND SHE HOPED SHE TOLD ME THE SORT OF INSIDE SECRET THAT I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN FAIRLY SOON BECAUSE THE WRENS WERE EXPANDING AND THEY EXPANDED VERY RAPIDLY AND I GOT IN VERY EASILY THEN BUT I HAD TO WAIT TILL THE DOORS OPEN CAUSE THE LORDS OF THE ADMIRALTY DIDN'T WANT WOMEN YOU KNOW THEY RELUCTANTLY TOOK THEM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR BUT YOU KNOW IT IT WAS A MAN'S SERVICE IT WASN'T FOR WOMEN REALLY SO WHAT WAS THE PROCESS THEN FROM TRANSITIONING FROM BEING A SECRETARY IN YET TO BECOMING A RENT BUT REMEMBER OF IT YES I REMEMBER YOU KNOW HAVING MY PAPERS OF BEING SENT TO LEADS BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY SUDDENLY EXPANDED THEY HAD TO OPEN NEW TRAINING DEPOTS I WAS IN MY EARLY TWENTIES AND I HAD WHAT THEY CALL A WHITE PAPER AND WHICH WAS A RECOMMENDATION FOR A COMMISSION AS SOON AS YOU WERE INTERVIEWED ORIGINAL YOU KNOW MOST GIRLS HAVE TO WAIT AND WORK A WHILE BUT I WAS OLDER AND I THINK THEY SAW ME AS A POSSIBLE ADMIN OFFICE OR THEY DID ACTUALLY BUT THEN I WENT FROM LEADS AFTER I DID MY BASIC TRAINING TO ROCHESTER WHICH IS REALLY THE CHATTER NOW I HAD SEEN MYSELF HIS BOAT'S CREW YOU KNOW AND BECAUSE I WAS A BRISTOLIAN I WANTED TO GO TO PLYMOUTH WHICH WAS A BUT THE NAVY HAD OTHER IDEAS SO THEY SENT ME A TO WAIT TO GO TO TRADING FOR AN ADMIN OFFICER AT CHATHAM REALLY AM ANYHOW I THEY PUT ME IN WHAT'S CALLED THE REGULATING OFFICE WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHERE YOU MONITOR PEOPLE COMING IN AND GOING OUT AND TELEPHONES AND I ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THE FIRST OFFICER WHO WAS THE ONE IN CHARGE WAS A VERY VERY DURABLE WOMAN AND AND SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY CALLED LADY BURTON SHAW WHO LIVED IN HOVE AND EVERY SATURDAY AFTERNOON LADY BURTON SHAW WOULD RING UP HER DAUGHTER JUST FOR A CHAT AND I WAS PUT ON THE TELEPHONE WELL I NEVER NEVER WORKED YOU KNOW THOSE PLUGGIS AND TELEPHONES I NEVER WORE ONE OF THOSE AND OF COURSE LADY BURTON SHAW COMES THROUGH AND I WAS A PANIC YOU KNOW I WASN'T VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT IT AND OF COURSE WHAT DO I DO IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THEIR CONVERSATION I PULLED THE PLUG OUT YOU SEE SO I HAD TO GO IN SHE CALLED ME IN AND SHE SAID WHO WAS ON THE TELEPHONE SO I SAID IT WAS ME MA'AM SO TO DO ON NOTHING BUT A BROKEN REED AND I THOUGHT WELL NOBODY HAS EVER CALLED ME A BROKEN READ BEFORE A A A BUT YOU KNOW IT DID ME THE WORLD OF GOOD I THOUGHT I WAS GOD'S GIFT TO THE NAVY YOU SEE AND I WASN'T A A A A A BUT THAT THAT REMARK REALLY HAS STUCK WITH ME ALL MY LIFE WILL YOU WILL YOU SEE ME ROUND WERE JASIMRATED YES I DID YOU KNOW WITH BUT I SUPPOSE I WAS NO COMMAND IT WAS DID YOU GO TO JUST WELL NOT ONLY IN SORT OF DE VISIT CASE THAT WE WERE BILLETED IN ROCHESTER AND BECAUSE I WAS DOING THE ADMIN WORK IN THE OFFICE THE OFFICE WAS ATTACHED TO THE BILLET HOW DID YOU FIND MOVING AROUND THE COUNTRY HAD YOU BEEN OUT OF BRISTOL THIS BOY AM I NOT VERY FAR NO THAT WAS ANOTHER THING YOU DIDN'T TRAVEL FAR YOU KNOW A HOLIDAYS WERE WELL THE FURTHEST WE WENT WITH TENBY IN SOUTH WALES BUT I HAD BEEN TO LONDON AM AND I HAD BEEN TO FRANCE ON THE SCHOOL TRIP AM ONCE BUT NO NOT VERY FAR WE WENT VERY WELL OFF ANYHOW AS A FAMILY YOU KNOW WE HAD TO CUT OUR CORNERS SO AFTER ROCHESTER THEN WHERE DID YOU WHERE DID YOU GO THEN AND WELL WHEN I WAS AT ROCHESTER AND THE FIRST OFFICE I WAS TELLING YOU CALLED ME A BROKEN READ AND I WAS IN THE AM WHAT DO THEY CALL IT NOW SORT OF THE OFFICE WHICH ALLOCATED POSTINGS TO THE GOAT CAUSE ALL THE GIRLS THERE WERE WAITING TO BE SENT SOMEWHERE AM AND I WAS THERE AND NOTHING CAME IN BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAME IN FROM THE ADMIRALTY AND NOTHING CAME IN I WAS INTERESTED IN I WAS DOWN FOR ADMIN AND THEN I FOUND THAT TO DO ADMIN I HAD TO GO TO LOWESTOFT TO THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE WHERE THEY TRAINED ADMIN OFFICERS AND I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A LONG WAITING LIST AND I THOUGHT WELL I DIDN'T JOIN THE NAVY TO SIT IN AN OFFICE AND WAIT FOR THAT SO I'D I WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO AND I SAID NO SO THEY SAID WELL YOU REALIZE YOU'LL GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST I SAY WELL I DIDN'T JOIN TO HAVE A COMMISSION ANYHOW YOU KNOW I JOIN AND DO A JOB SO SHE SAID TO ME IF YOU SEE ANYTHING COMING THROUGH A IT WAS A TELLY PRINTER IN THOSE DAYS AND LET ME KNOW AND I'LL SEE I SAY WELL ALL I KNOW IS I DON'T WANT TO WORK IN LONDON I DON'T MIND WHERE ELSE I GO AND YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO STICK WITH MY SHORT HAND AND A A SORT OF GENERAL OFFICE WORK OH YES HE SAID SO IT COMES IF IT'S AT THE TIME WHEN GENERAL IS HOW WAS THE GETTING TO BE QUITE WELL KNOWN AS A COMMANDER AND HE SET UP IF YOU REMEMBER SHAPE AND I LOOKED AT MY SOMETHING CAME IN WITH A AND C X STRAIGHT SHAPE AND I THOUGHT THAT'S INTERESTING AND AT THE C X F WAS THE ALLIED NAVAL COMMANDER EXPEDITIONARY FORCE AND THAT WAS ADMIRAL RAMSEY AND I THOUGHT THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING YOU KNOW SO I WENT RELIED COULD I HAVE MY NAME PUT UP FOR THAT VACANCY AND SO SHE AGREED AND YOU KNOW YOU HAD TO TAKE THE CHANCE WHAT OTHER APPLICATIANS THEY HAD AND I GOT IT AND I SAID WHERE IS IT SO SHE SAID WELL TO START WITH YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO NORFOLK SQUARE IN LONDON WHICH IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF SHAPE AND THE A AND C E GROUP WERE COLLECTING THERE AM AND THEY WERE MOSTLY RENTS WHO WERE GOING TO DO THE D DAY PLANNING BUT I GOT IT BECAUSE I'D PUT IN FRANCE STROKE SHAPE I GOT ATTACHED TO THE THIS IS WHERE ADMIRAL PARRY CAME IN TO ADMIRAL PARRY WHO CIVICALLY BRITISH WE HADN'T STARTED DE DAY BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS ALREADY POST OPERATIVE PLANNING AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS I THAT WELL WE HAVEN'T WON THE WAR WHILE THEY'RE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE YOU SEE AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS CAUGHT UP IN THAT FROM THEN ON I WAS ATTACHED TO HIM AND SENT TO BUSHY PARK IN HERTFORDSHIRE NOT HARTFORD SHIRE IT'S NEAR HAMPTON COURT PALACE AND IT WAS GENERAL IS HOUSED AT HEADQUARTERS FOR THEY WERE COLLECTING ALL THE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE PEOPLE THERE YOU'LL KNOW WELL THE TROOPS WERE BEING COLLECTED AROUND KENTON SUSSEX AND PLACE SORRY IT'S MY NERVES A BRILLIANT USE NO A AND AM I SO I DON'T WANT TO GO TO LONDON BUT ANYHOW IN THE END THEY SAID WELL YOU'LL ONLY BE HOLD HELD THERE UNTIL AM AND I WAS ONLY HELD THERE A DAY I REMEMBER SITTING ON THE WALL OUTSIDE NORFOLK HOUSE WHICH IS WHERE THE LONDON GROUP WERE AND TOLD TO WAIT AND SOMEBODY WOULD PICK ME UP BECAUSE FROM THEN ON IT BECAME HIGHLY SECRETIVE I WAS SITTING LIKE A LONELY RED AND WITH MY NAVAL CASE THAT NOTHING ELSE AND A JEEP CAME LOOMING ROUND THE SQUARE AND AN AMERICAN STOPPED BY ME ANYWAY SO THERE YOU RAY AND IRENE BALMY GO IN A BUSHY PARK WELL I SHALL I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING I'VE JUST BEEN TOLD TO SIT ON THIS WALL SO HE SAID HE GOT ME ABOARD HIS JEEP AND WE WENT THROUGH THAT IT WASN'T FAR FROM NORFOLK TO GET OUT OF LONDON WENT TO BUSHY PARK AND OF COURSE WHEN I GET TO BUSHY PARK I'M THE ONLY REN THERE BECAUSE IT WAS A SEPARATE UNIT OF THE BIG GROUP THAT WERE AT NORFOLK HOUSE A FORTY FOUR I THINK FORTY FOUR FORTY FIVE HERE I JUST DESCRIBED THE SET UP A BUSHY PARK AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE BEFORE DADA AM WELL BUSHY PARK AM IT IS I PRESUME IT'S A SORT OF LOCAL IS A VERY LARGE PARK AND IN IT WERE PORTER CABINS IN WHICH BY THEN YOU YOU'D GOT THE BRITISH AND THE FRENCH AND THE WILTING AMERICANS THERE WAS A FALSE ANSWER NOT LOUIS NEED YES WELL THERE WERE A FEW BUT NOT MANY BUT I WAS THINKING OF THE THE GROUP THAT THEY SPLIT GERMANY UP INTO REGIONS DIDN'T THEY THAT THE BRITISH RUSSIA RUSSIAN BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER RUSSIANS BEING AT BUSHY PARK I THINK THEY LINKED UP LATER AM BUT I REMEMBER BEING IN IN ONE OF THESE WE HAD OUR OFFICE AND THIS IS WHERE I DID NOT SHE COULDN'T SAY I MET HIM BUT THE DOODLE BUGS HAD STARTED FLYING AND AM WE WEED THEY GOT THEY HAD BUSHY PARK IN THEIR SIGHTS AND THEY GOT VERY NEAR US SO THERE WERE AIR RAGE SHELTERS BUILT SPECIALLY AND A LOT OF THE AMERICANS PARTICULARLY THE WOMEN IN THE AMERICAN ARMY HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE AND THEY JUST WENT TO PIECES IF THERE WAS AN ARAD THEY THEY WERE TERRIBLY NERVOUS LOT AND BUT I QUITE ENJOYED BEING WITH THEM BECAUSE IT WAS A DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE ALTOGETHER THE METHOD OF EATING AND THE THE EQUIPMENT THEY GAVE US YOU KNOW IN THE HYGIENE THAT WAS PUT IN AND SO I WAS REALLY I WAS UNDER A T S SUPERVISION AND SOMEBODY CALLED LADY BRECKNOCK I THINK SHE BECAME QUITE A POWER IN THE LAND AFTERWARDS FROM A POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW BUT SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF US AND SHE AND I RESENTED HER BECAUSE SHE SHE USED TO OPEN MY POST WHICH COURSE THE NAVY NEVER OPENED YOUR POST BUT THE CASE BECAUSE I WAS UNDER UNDER A T S RULE ALL OUR POST WAS OPENED AND LADY BRECKLOCK ALWAYS MADE A POINT OF READING AND REMEMBERING WHAT WAS IN AND I WAS ALWAYS SENDING HOME FOR MONEY AND IT SEEMS SHE WAS ALWAYS SAYING YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED MONEY YOU'VE GOT PLENTY EVEN THOUGH YOU SHOULD MANAGE ON WHAT YOU'VE GOT THAT WAS SEVEN AND SIX WEEKS THERE WERE FRONT FROM THERE AND DID YOU MEAN ASANA WELL YES NO I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE DOODLE BUGS AND AND IF HE WAS ON SIGHT AM IN HIS OFFICE HE DIDN'T COME VERY OFTEN BECAUSE OF COURSE HIS RESPONSIBILITY WAS ENORMOUS AND THE PLACES YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAID ISENHOUR WAS THERE BUT THEY WERE NEVER THERE FOR LONG BUT HE DID USE THE AIR RAID SHELTER WHICH WAS THE SAME SHELTER THAT WE USED BECAUSE WE WERE IN ADJOINING OFFICES BUT YOU KNOW HE HE HARDLY SAW US BECAUSE HE POPPED DOWN AND ALL HIS ENTOURAGE WOULD BE WITH HIM AM BUT VERY I MEAN TO SAY WE DIDN'T FEEL WE WERE LESSER THAN HIM YOU KNOW HE ALWAYS HAD A WORD TO SAY BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY SAY YOU MET HIM YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T PARIS AM NOT ACTUALLY UNTIL I WENT ACROSS TO TO FRANCE BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME HIS ONE OF HIS SIDEKICKS WAS A CAPTAIN OWEN WHO HAD BEEN THE PORTUGUESE THE NAME IT WASN'T AN ATTACHE TO THE NAVAL REPRESENTATIVE IN LISBON AM AND SO WHEN HE HE JOINED US ON ON THE STAFF OF ADMIRAL PARRY I WAS ATTACHED TO HIM AND HE ALWAYS CALLED ME HIS MANNA YOU KNOW I NEVER ACTUALLY SPOKEN TO A PORTUGUESE TO FIND OUT I WAS TOLD IT MEANT FRIEND THAT I WAS ALWAYS A HE ALWAYS TOLD PEOPLE IF THEY WANTED SOMETHING GO AND ASK MY MANNINA BUT HE HE WAS A VERY GENTLE VERY NICE MAN WHO ABOUT WHOM I KNEW NEVER HEARD MUCH ABOUT HIM AT ALL I KNOW ADMIRAL PARRY AM AT THE END OF THE WAR AM I THINK HE HE WAS AN APPLE GROWER IN KENT THAT'S WHAT IS HIS RETIREMENT THAT'S WHAT HE DID BUT CAPTAIN OWEN I NEVER KNEW WHAT DID YOU SENSE WHAT DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS ESCALATION TOWARDS THE DAY HOW HOW SO PRIVY TO IT WERE YOU OH ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH I WASN'T IN THE TYPING POOL AS IT WAS AND I KNEW I'D SEEN PAPERS GOING THROUGH AND AND YOU KNEW WHAT THE PLANNING WAS WHEN YOU SAY IS TO SECRET WHAT JUST DESCRIBE THE SECRECY PROCESS WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO BE YOU NOTE LET IT WELL IT WAS A BIGOT WAS THE THE THIRD LEVEL WHICH WAS THE ABSOLUTELY I DON'T THINK WE COULD EVER GET THROUGH THERE WERE SPECIAL LINES AND THINGS ON THE TELEPHONE AND IT WAS MOSTLY FOR USE BY TELEPHONE BUT I NEVER REALLY KNEW HOW THEY DECIDED I KNEW WHEN I HAD TO IF I HAD TO MAKE A CALL WHICH LINE I HAD TO USE WHETHER IT WAS THE ORDINARY ONE THE TOP SECRET OR BIGGER BUT I NEVER KNEW WHEN SAY CAPTAIN OWEN WAS WANTING ME TO DO SOMETHING AND HE SAID THAT 'LL BE BIGGER HOW HE KNEW IT HAD TO BE BIGGER NOW THAT WAS SOMETHING KNOWN TO HIM IS BIGGER ABOVE TOPSY YES HERE JUST DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR JOB WAS AND WHAT YOU RE ACTUALLY DOING A PREDOMINANT I WAS IN LONDON WITH A WELL MAINLY AM DOING THE ADMIRALS OR CAPTAIN ON WHICHEVER ONE WAS AROUND DOING THE THEIR POST AND AND TAKING DICTATION AND WHAT PLANNING THEY HAD TO DO IN TERMS OF POST OF MOST OF THE POST OPERATIVE STUFF WAS THE DIVISION OF THE GERMAN NAVY WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER YOU KNOW WHO WAS GOING TO HAVE WHAT AND THAT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE OF COURSE THE RUSSIANS WANTED EVERYTHING THIS WAS MUCH FURTHER ON WHEN WE WERE IN BERLIN BUT THE RUSSIANS ALWAYS WANTED ALL THE BIG STUFF YOU KNOW AND WE KNEW ALL THE BEST EQUIPMENT WAS IN THE SMALLER DESTROYERS THAN THING SO AND WE WENT FOR THOSE AND SO YOU KNOW THEY WERE WORKING OUT ALL THOSE SORT OF THINGS AND CAUSE IT ALL HAD TO GO UP THROUGH THE ADMIRALTY AND BACK AGAIN SO BUT TOOK TIME BUT IT WAS JUST STRAIGHT FORWARD SHORT AND REPORTING TO THE POST OPERATIVE PLANNING EVEN BEFORE DEDE YE DID YOU DO YOU EVER MEET ANY YOU KNOW WITH ANY OTHER NOT CHURCHILL ANY OF THE OTHER BIG WIGS BIBI NEVER SAW CHURCHILL AND MONTGOMERY AND WE WHEN WE WERE IN GERMANY IT WAS THE FASHION TO HAVE A DOG AND I NEVER HAD ONE BUT MY FRIEND HAD ONE WHICH HE CALLED FRAT CAUSE THAT OF COURSE WAS NO FRATILIZATION AND AND I REMEMBER WE WE HAD AN OFFICE WE WERE IN FRANKFORT AT THE TIME AND THE OFFICE THERE HAD A SORT OF STAIRCASE GOING UP AND PADDY ALWAYS TOOK FRAT TO WORK WITH NOBODY MIND BECAUSE THE WAR WAS OVER BUT BY THEN AND WE WERE GOING UP STAIRS ONE DAY AND AND SOMEBODY SAID WATCH OUT MONTGOMERY'S COMING AND HE WAS IN THE BUILDING AT SOME MEETING AND HE WAS COMING AGAIN WITH HIS ON TRADE DOWN STAIRS AS WE WERE GOING UP YOU SEE AND AN APPARENTLY I ARE HE DIDN'T DO IT IN FRONT OF US BUT WHEN HE GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE HE TOLD HIS ADJUTANT TO CONTACT WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REDS TO SAY THAT HE DIDN'T WANT DOGS IN THE BUILDING A LITTLE DIFFICULT SO IF YOU YOU WERE VERY PRIVY TO ALL THIS STUFF WHERE DID YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE JUNE DID THE FATHER SAID YOU KNOW THEM WELL YES BECAUSE YOU KNOW OF THE DELAY JUMA DEED A YES NOT OF THE DELAY BUT YOU KNOW THERE BUT YOU SEE YOU KNEW THAT THAT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE DAY THAT ME AND IS A HAPPY YOU EVER GET WELL IT WAS IT YOU DID AND YOU DIDN'T YOU KNOW THERE WERE ALWAYS THINGS BEING SAID TO PUT YOU OFF SO THAT YOU WENT A HUNDRED PERCENT SHORE BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYBODY WAS REALLY BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER AND THINGS BUT WE WERE WHEN I WAS AT CHATTOM AND THERE WASN'T YOU KNOW WE'D DONE ALL THE WORK WE HAD TO DO AND WE WERE WAITING AND WE WERE SENT TO CHERRY PICKING IN THE KENT ORCHARDS AND THAT WAS AMAZING BECAUSE THE OLDER LANES AND AND ROADS ALL ROUND SORT OF KENT AND AND THE SORT OF AREA GOING DOWN TO THE COAST WAS FULL OF ARMY VEHICLES AND MEN WAITING AND YOU KNEW THAT THEY WERE THERE READY TO GO BUT I THINK THAT'S HOW I LEARNED RATHER THAN THROUGH THE OFFICE SO AFTER BUSH GOT YOU WENT BACK TO SHATTER BACK IN BUSHY BAG GOT TO GET THIS BECAUSE I DETERMINED NOW THAT I AM FROM BUSHY PARK AM WE WERE MOVED BACK TO LONDON AND I WORKED IN PRINCE'S GARDENS THERE AND WE LIVED IN IN ENGLAND'S LANE IN IN SORT ENGLAND'S LANE IS SORT OF SWISS COTTAGE WAY AND THERE WAS A NURSES HOME NOW I THINK IT WAS A CHERRY CROSS NURSES HOME AND THEY USED THAT FOR REN BILLET USED TO TRAVEL BOTH TRAVELED TO A PRINCE'S GARDENS FROM THERE AND IT WAS FROM PRINCE'S GARDENS THAT I WAS DRAFTED OVER TO FRANCE CAN YOU MARRY A WHEN YOU FOUND A YOU BEGAN FOLLOWING THE EXPEDITION BUT I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED CAUSE I FELT THAT WHY I AM STILL THAT MY NAVAL LIFE WAS ANYTHING BUT NAVY YOU KNOW THOUGH IT WAS A TEASE I HAD GREAT GREAT IDEAS OF BEING BOAT SCREW AS I SAID AND GOING TO SEA WITH THE MAIL AND SO I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE INLAND AS IT WERE AM BUT ONCE I GOT USED TO IT AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN ADVENTURE AS WELL IN GOING OVER DID YOU SAIL TO FRANCE WE WENT OUT YOU KNOW THESE AND BOATS THEY TOOK THE TROOPS OVER IN THE WE WENT OVER BECAUSE ACTUALLY AM WHEN IT CAME TO IT THE WAR WAS THAT THE ARMY WAS ALMOST IN BERLIN BY THEN SO THEY FELT IT WAS SAFE TO PUT THE GIRLS OVER AM AND WE WENT ACROSS TO A LITTLE TOWN IN NORMANDY CALLED GRANVILLE ON THE WERE DUCKS WE CALLED THEM YOU KNOW DO KICK THOSE LIKE LANDING CRAFT AM AND I WAS TERRIBLY SICK I MAY SAY IT PROVED TO ME I WASN'T A SALE THEY WERE DESCRIBE THE SORT OF THE DAY THAT YOU WENT ON THE THE LANDING CRASS TO FRANCE AND JUST GOING BACK A LITTLE BIT ON A STORY IN AND WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF KNOW THAT DAY WHERE DID YOU SAIL FROM AND WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LIKE I SAID WE CAN REMEMBER IF THE WEATHER WASN'T TOO GOOD HENCE THE FACT THAT I WAS AND I SUPPOSE I THINK THERE WERE PROBABLY NEARLY BETWEEN FIFTY AND A HUNDRED OF US GOING NOT ONLY REINS BUT OTHERS AND TRYING TO THINK WE WENT FROM A ONE AT ONE OF THE LITTLE PORTS THEY WEREN'T REALLY PORTS THAT WERE AROUND THE BALI RIVER THAT THAT WAY AM WE WERE EXCITED WE DIDN'T YOU KNOW YOU YOU YOU HAD ALL SORTS OF IMAGINATIONS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN CROSSING THE CHANNEL MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO SWIM FAR ENOUGH AND THAT THE YOU KNOW THEY WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WATER WHEN WE GOT THE OTHER SIDE LIKE YOU SEE THE MEN AND YOU KNOW TRAILING OUT WITH ALL THEIR STUFF THROUGH WATER THEY MANAGED TO BEACH US SO WE WERE QUITE DRY WHEN WE GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU KNOW THE FRENCH ACTUALLY IN NORMANDY WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING THEY WERE VERY PLEASED TO SEE US THEY WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN MY VIEW TO THE ONES WE MET IN PARIS WHAT WAS IT OBVIOUSLY WATER ON OH YES YES YOU KNOW THE CAUSE IT WOULD BE AFTER D DAY OF COURSE THAT WE WENT ACROSS THOUGH THINGS WERE STILL PRETTY BROKEN YOU KNOW AND ALL THE SORT OF FRONT LINE HOUSES AND THINGS AND WE'RE ALL BASHED ABOUT CAUSE THEY'D BEEN BOMBARDED OF COURSE FROM THE SEA AND AND AND GRANVILLE WAS TO SET OUT THERE UNTIL YOU KNOW YOU SAID A WAR WAS A BASIC ONE IT WAS A WAR ZONE WELL IT WAS IT WAS JUST A SORT OF GETTING OFF POINT FOR MOVING PEOPLE ON BEHIND THE ARMY I THINK IT WAS FELT TO BE A REASONABLE PLACE TO START MOVING CAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF EQUIPMENT AS WELL WE DIDN'T BUT THE ARMY AND AND THE AIR FORCE AND THE NAVY FOR THAT MATTER THEY ALL HAD EQUIPMENT TO MOVE UP WITH US AM I THINK GRANVILLE PROBABLY AT AT A LITTLE TOWN WAS CONSIDERED YOU KNOW THEY HAD A GOOD ROAD NOT GOOD BUT THE TRANSPORT SITUATION MOVING STUFF WAS REASONABLE BUT VERY BASIC LIVING CONDITIONS YOU KNOW WE HAD NO WATER RUNNING WATER OR A WE HAD SORT OF THINGS LIKE YOUR TRIPOD WITH CANVAS BAGS IN THEM WHICH WE USED AS WASHING MACHINE FOR WASHING WHAT AGES THERE BUT IT WAS LIKE A CABIN PIG REALLY FROM A LIVING POINT OF VIEW AND VERY LITTLE WORK WE HAD AT THAT TIME WHAT WERE YOU JUST WRITING DID YOU HAVE TELLY PRINCES OR ANYTHING THAT WAS THERE ANY TECHNOLOGIES OH YES SIR THERE WAS A LOT OF IT BUT NOT IN THE GROUP I WAS WITH YOU KNOW THAT THAT ACTUALLY THE FIRST PEOPLE TO GO OVER WITH THE COMMUNICATORS AM THE TELEPHONE OPERATORS AND SO ON AM AND OF COURSE THEY WERE STILL THE ENGINEERS WERE STILL FITTING UP FIELD AM EQUIPMENT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND THERE WERE A LOT OF WRENS IN THAT GROUP TREMENDOUS LUMBER AND FROM GRAVEL AND YOU KNOW THEY FOUND THAT THE WORK THEY WANTED ME TO DO WAS MORE CENTERED BACK IN LONDON SO I WAS SHIPPED BACK TO THE LONDON AND TO WAIT UNTIL THEY'D PREPARED WHAT WE NEEDED AND I HAD TO HELP DO THAT AND WE WENT THEN TO PARIS BUT I WENT FROM LONDON FROM ENGLAND'S LANE THAT WAS TO PARIS ON MY OWN AND THEN I REALLY WAS I'D NOT BEEN ANYWHERE ON MY OWN BEFORE AND THEY I ONCE MET WHEN I GOT TO THE GARDENER CAUSE I WENT OVER ON THE TRAIN BY ANOTHER RAN WHO'D BEEN OVER AND THEN WE WERE I WAS BILLETED AND WORKED IN THE CHATEAU IN WELL IT'S A SUBURB OF PARIS ANYHOW CALM AND I WORKED THERE FOR A VERY SHORT TIME AND THEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP WERE FOLLOWING ON BEHIND THE ARMY AND WE WENT FROM PARIS TO FRANKFORT AND I DIDN'T ENJOY FRANKFORT VERY MUCH BECAUSE THERE WASN'T MUCH TO DO BY NOW YOU KNOW MOST OF THE PLANNING HAD BEEN DONE AND LIFE BECAME RATHER A SORT OF THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY POINT IN WHAT WE WERE DOING WE DONE IT ALL YOU KNOW AND SO IT WAS A BIT OF A PLAYGROUND IS AT THE END OF THIS AFTER THE WAR YES LAMY SAID THAT THE TROOPS THAT HAD ENTERED BERLIN AND AND WE WERE BACK IN PARIS SO IT WAS THOUGHT OF JUST AS THE WAR WAS ENDING AND YET IT HAD ENDED BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME IN IN PARIS AND WHAT WHAT WERE THE FASHION AS YOU KNOW THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HATS MADE OUT OF CELLOPHANE PAPER YOU KNOW SWEET PAPERS AND THINGS THAT THE WOMEN HAD MADE THEY SEEMED UNTOUCHED BY THE WAR IN PARIS THEY DIDN'T MUCH LIKE US I DON'T THINK I THINK THE GERMANS HAD GIVEN THEM QUITE A GOOD TIME YOU WILL HAVE NO PARRIES NO I MET ADMIRAL PARRY WHEN I GOT TO PARIS AND WITHDRAWING AS AS A PERSON VERY QUIET YOU'LL KNOW YOU YOU DIDN'T REALLY FEEL YOU KNOW HE COULD HIT ANYBODY LET ALONE KILL ANYBODY BUT A AND OR EVEN DISCIPLINE ANYBODY HE WAS ALWAYS VERY GENTLE AND VERY NICE TO WORK FOR A BUT VERY CLEVER OF COURSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WANTED AND WHAT JUST DESCRIBE THE SORT OF THE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WHAT ONE YOU DID FOR HIM AND WHAT WHAT THE PURPOSE OF YOUR BEING THERE WAS A JUBILEE BUT YOU SEE MOST OF THE GRA HE HE REALLY WOULD HAVE COMMUNICATED TO CAPTAIN OWEN MOST OF WHAT HE WANTED COULD HE'D BE OFF DOING SOMETHING ELSE AND BUT SO THAT CAPTAIN OWEN WAS REALLY THE PERSON WHO WAS GIVING ME WORK WHEN THERE WAS WORK TO BE DONE BUT AD ADMIRAL PARRY CERTAINLY AND WAS VERY APPROACHABLE YOU KNOW AND HE MIXED WITH US THERE WAS NO SORT OF OFFICERS AND OTHERS AND EVERYBODY MIXED AND A IS HE IS A DIFFICULT ONE TO DESCRIBE REALLY FOR THE WORKER AS HE MUST BE DESCRIBED IN HER YOU KNOW BUT THE WHEN WE WERE IN BERLIN DO YOU KNOW BERLIN AT ALL IN THE LAKES THAT THE THE FANCY THE THE LAKES THAT ARE ON THE OUTSKIRTS WERE WHEN WE WE WERE LIVING IN IN WHAT HAD BEEN THE JAPANESE EMBASSY IN BERLIN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AND IT WAS IN THAT DISTRICT WHERE THE LAKES WERE BUT I ALWAYS SAID THE FANCY LAKES AND THEY WOULD FREEZE OVER IN THE WINTER CASE WE HAD A WINTER THERE AND YOU YOU KNOW THE ADMIRAL WOULD ARRANGE SKATING PARTIES AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE ICE THERE SO THICK AS IT'S SO COLD THAT YOU COULD HAVE BARBECUES ON THE ICE AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE LIFE BECAME A BIT SUPERFICIAL AND LATTERLY WHEN THERE WASN'T MUCH WORK TO DO YOU KNOW YOU REALLY FELT YOU SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE DOING SOME WORK AND HOW DID YOU GET FROM PARIS INTO FRANKFORD IN YOUR RAILWAYS ARE IN VEHICLES OR ON NAVAL JEEPS MOST OF THE TRAVELLING WE HAD THE ONLY ONLY THING WHEN I WENT FROM FRANKFORT TO BERLIN I HAD BEEN HOME ON LEAVE AND WHEN I GOT BACK M IT WAS TO FIND THAT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY THEY COULDN'T NOTIFY ME THEY COULDN'T GET HOLD OF ME TO LET ME KNOW THAT THE MAIN PARTY HAD GONE ON TO BERLIN AND THAT WHEN I GOT BACK TO FRANKFORT I HAD TO GO AND REPORT TO ONE OF THE ARMY OFFICERS TO GET TRANSPORT AND WHEN I GOT THERE I FOUND A MESSAGE TO SAY THAT GENERAL EISENHOWER'S CHAUFFEUR HAD MARRIED ONE OF OUR FRIENDS ON THEY WERE VERY FRIENDLY BEFORE I WENT AND THAT HE LET THEM HAVE HIS HOUSE IN NEAR FRANKFORT AM FOR THEIR HONEYMOON AND THEY WERE BOTH DUE BACK IN BERLIN AND THEY WOULD GIVE ME A LIFT SO I WENT BREEZING UP THE AUTOBAHN FROM FRANKFORT TO BERLIN AND GENERALIZE THE HOUSE CAR MAKE WHAT WAS GOOD IN IT WAS THOSE WOMEN ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED HER THAT REALLY DID SHAKE ME WHEN I SAW IT YOU KNOW THESE ALMOST EVERY BUILDING WE SAW WAS AN DESTRUCT DESTROYED AND THERE WERE THESE AND THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY OLD WOMEN BUT THEY LOOKED OLD CAUSE THEY WERE ALL HUNCHED UP YOU KNOW IN DARK CLOTHES WITH WHEELBARROWS CLEARING THE STREETS AND WORKING SO HARD AND LITTLE FOOD YOU KNOW THEY WERE WORKING WITH VERY LITTLE STRENGTH AM I MUST GIVE THE GERMS THAT THEY DO THEY DID WORK HARD TO GET BERLIN BACK DID YOU GO TO THE BRAND BAD GAME OR THE BOY EARLY YEAH WELL THAT AGAIN WAS MORE LIKE A TOURIST TRIP YOU KNOW WE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO THINK WHAT OUR OFFICE IN BERLIN WAS LIKE AND YOU BY THEN OF COURSE IT WAS THE CONTROL COMMISSION AND AM I CAN'T VISUALIZE IT AT ALL IT'S AN ABSOLUTE BLANK IN MY MEMORY I CAN REMEMBER THE REGNERY THE JAPANESE EMBASSY AND I CAN REMEMBER GOING ON THE TRAM FROM THERE TO THE OFFICE BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OFFICE AT ALL AND I IT TILL I WAS THERE FOR NEARLY A YEAR THAT'S A WE WENT TO SEE THE BUNKER YOU KNOW WHERE HITLER WAS KILLED AND THAT WAS STILL IN IN YOU KNOW PRETTY ROUGH STATE YOU KNOW BITS OF FURNITURE WERE STILL THERE YOU KNOW IT HADN'T BEEN TIED UP AND WHAT WAS YOUR SENTIMENT TOWARD THE GERMAN CAPITAL WELL IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE I FOUND THEM VERY HELPFUL BUT THEN AND YOU KNOW I QUITE LIKE THEM BUT COURSE THEY THEY HAD A LOT TO GAIN FROM US IN THE WAY OF FOOD AND AND AND SO ON AND THE RUSSIANS OF COURSE WERE THE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE STORY GOES THAT THE MAIN RUSSIAN ARMY THAT TOOK BERLIN THEY PULLED THEM BACK AND THEY REPLACED THEM WITH THE SORT OF THIRD LINE WERE MONGOLIANS AND THEY WERE PRETTY ROUGH AND ON ONE OCCASION COMING HOME FROM THE OFFICE A COUPLE VERY LATE THEY USED TO DRINK AN AWFUL LOT ANY BOOTS THEY CAN HOLD A COUPLE OF VERY DRUNK RUSSIANS STARTED WE WERE WALKING HOME FROM THE OFFICE IN BERLIN TO OUR DIG AND THEY STARTED GETTING THEIR GUNS OUT AND SHOOTING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND WE HAD TO JUMP IN THE HEDGE AND AFTER THAT TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY AND AFTER THAT THEY PUT A FAIRLY STRONG MARINE PRESENCE ON THE YOU KNOW A SORT OF GUARD ON AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO TRAVEL ON OUR OWN AND SO WE WERE PRETTY OCA ON TRANSPORT WE GOT THE TRAM HOME OR AS IF YOU STARTED WALKING WE HAD A A GERMAN COOK IN THE RENERY AM AND HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO BE PLEASANT TO US BUT HE WAS BECAUSE OF COURSE HE HE USED TO COLLECT OUR USED TEA BAGS AND TAKE THEM HOME AND
