 what was some of the one can you remember the list of the first few journeys of what you did. a did you go to <LOC>norway<\LOC> quietly. on the first trip i took somers was detailed to carry out a anastic sweep whilst accompanying arms queen mary with churchill aboard are on route to a meeting with the roosevelt in <LOC>quebec<\LOC> or at <LOC>quebec<\LOC><PER>mary<\PER> with churchill aboard are on route to a meeting with the <PER>roosevelt<\PER> in quebec or at quebec but to due. to a typical atlantic storm gale force winds and mountainous seas we had to call it off after seventeen. hours because it was the conditions were so bad and resulted that we limped into saint john's newfoundland four days after queen mary's birth at <LOC>quebec<\LOC><PER>john<\PER>'s newfoundland four days after queen <PER>mary<\PER>'s birth at quebec so some baptism and my first trip to see how were you sea legs a i was i was never sea sick that was one thing i ought always boasted about others never seasick can you describe conditions in those seas well as i say as a biomountainous seas and of the ship would be it up and down. mainly he went going into the water and the water would cascade over the top of the bridge and roll down the a over the guns and all the rest of it a what was your you fiction station the time we on or off my watch i was as i say is on an erlicangun which was on a platform a posted just after the after the funnel drily want an alice when in these storms or you'd better as an elite are you thinking i wish i'd to had gone to the airport is never a never what was that we say that we came back from <LOC>canada<\LOC><PER>alice<\PER> when in these storms or you'd better as an elite are you thinking i wish i'd to had gone to the airport is never a never what was that we say that we came back from canada and then we were attached with her units of the fleet to carry out a bombardment of installations on the norwegian coast this is our first my first taste of the war as it were. and are a on retiring from lately action we were pursued by a enemy aircraft but fortunately they didn't press home they had too too too much so were we escaped unscathed as it were is that the first time you got to fire the alleges i didn't actually fire because the four sevens the bigger guns had kept the aircraft at bay you know but we were close up ready to fire but the my range was only a thousand yards you see so that i say it to though i was close up i didn't actually have to open fire at that at that time what what was it like to be you know although you'd done gunnery training how was it can you mail it felt like to be on board when the ship really opened up in terms. . of the full bombardment what what was the effect on the ship like it was obviously a loved noise from the from the four sevens and a but really i was a great deal because he was steaming and parry doing twenty twenty plus knots so that you got to did the judge from the the ships firing the big guns firing but as we were closed up of course concentrating on our own efforts didn't take too much notice of this yes so we can after the norwegian trip across a then it was her arctic calm voice.
 this was different as churchill described the worst journey in the world and it was pretty terrific not on occasions the ship could get in the bitterly cold conditions a covered with ice over the guns the deck and no reset which meant you had to chip it all off otherwise you were vulnerable and if it was not the icy conditions it was still bitterly cold but we ran into gale force winds and mountainous seas the sort that would take you the crest to the crest of a wave twenty thirty feet in the air and then drop me down into the trough and as you were going down a judderan shuddering and the pole ship would be shaking and then you become completely awash with a with the wave and you wondered whether or not you'd stay afloat did you add and sometimes it was so the conditions were so bad that i'm we could go off watch and go back to our aft after best deck and find it a wash with three or four inches of water the plates having sprung some of its ribbit and there was only one way to get rid of it and that was to put the water in the buckets and a hand it in a chain and pass it up the ladder through the hatch way and throw it over the side ramis it very very in and how very helpful having just come off watch when all you wanted to take sleep if you could you now i mean what you know the the the conditions the weather conditions are one thing obviously another big problem with the arts it was you either had you boats on you or you miss alias you don't remember any other very much as indeed we certainly the eu boats of times we did get what we call a ping on the aztec and i then you start or pursuing them and of times dropping depth charges but in our experience and we never actually encountered one on the surface we seemed to do this one neighbor under an underwater whether or not we scored any success it's hard to know because sometimes there was oil but the whether they were just releasing it was the road samaras you know what was your what was his duty on these russian convoys just talk about strategy and its positioning et cetera well we go because of the leek a dad get up to thirty two knots and therefore we were of times covering the perimeter guarding the other cruisers aircraft carriers or battleships if they were so that we were more or less scouting as it were and a viewing the the horizon to make sure the car lot of my job was on lookouts one making sure there was some no enemy aircraft enemy shipping or you boats all for that matter in the aircraft so this was our our role lily did you did you get ashore in the <PER>pollyanna<\PER> lemons certainly in the in <PER>pollyanna<\PER> in a year remember what it was like a bit desolate a we did manage to play football on some icy pitch there button there wasn't really much to recall the only people that would likely to speak to you would be er young children and though some of them could speak english some english but they seemed to be trained to ask about the radar to find out if the what they could about the radar course we were warned about this really what the the cause they didn't have it apparently
 marine john salter was an able seaman anti aircraft gunner i joined the royal navy in <DATE>nineteen forty two<\DATE><PER>john<\PER> salter was an able seaman anti aircraft <PER>gunner i<\PER> joined the royal navy in nineteen forty two at the age of eighteen and. trained at camus rally and asmus drake <PER>bevin<\PER> why did you why did you want to join the navy over in any other service is just a preference of the sea and what it offered or at least what i thought it offered a where are you from where were you living sort of early part of the war i was in a heat at the time but i was living in bath. at the time tell me a bit about that that process that you go through and where you you know the early stages of your training well as i say i joined it to h s rally ah and we did the usual things that of drilling et cetera a boat working whalers and that type of thing until then i switched to a m s drake and then i took up the the anti aircraft gunnery <DATE>yesterday<\DATE> are they really are there any memories any stories you can remember from your training at drake or rally well they were at a we were at saint budo and it was just a normal a normal trading the session it a that there was nothing outstanding at that time we spent one week end on the breakwater fort. and most of that time were peeling potatoes does about it as far as i know that's right when did you get your draughts and and what to tell me about how you felt about that way you went and when you saw the ship at the same or after training i was drafted to a games somers an s class destroyer which was commissioning at ebelentine and i say i joined her there well what do you remember seeing her for the first time can you remember that day well you know she s a sleek the lame destroyer and you just tell me a bit about somers what what your mess was like you know what life was like on board for you know a young sailor well i say it was an optimistic a where you went down stairs there were lockers a which we slept on mostly when we were on the the arctic convoys because we couldn't sling hammocks. we had the hammock storage down below there were two messes two or three messes about time ten fifteen in a mess we use to have to prepare our own name meals and this was taken up to the galley galley where they were good and i had to cook of the mess and immediately your turn came round probably every four or five days and i do now say we just off watch i just sat and chatted and looked at anything that was available you now that tubing and why why didn't use why didn't you sling your hook at your hammer sir i hammewhy did you sling your hammer away in the art a bit because the sea and that was a was not convenient to too much three and because we were too often have to prepare to to go on watch on action stay at action stations so i say a lot of the time we didn't a undress properly we're just waiting there all the time to to go and watch or go on a go to action stations.
