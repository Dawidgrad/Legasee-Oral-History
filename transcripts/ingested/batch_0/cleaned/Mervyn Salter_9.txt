did you like this chap this skipper we didn't get to know him too well because he was very detached the only thing to say in all honesty was that he was a good skipper he got us through these things that other men may not have done and as i say he maintained a very efficient ship so much so that on our return to the uk the war over and hes still carrying out night exercises torpedo attacks that sort of thing you know dummy ones to keep us on our toes what was his name manley power admiral manley power he finished his admiral of the dockyard at portsmouth and he lived on the isle of white i think just conclude by saying that sadly my ship was recommissioned in nineteen forty six and was mined in the corfu channel in october well after the end of the last war and subsequently had to be broken up being of no further use for service that was mines laid by the albanians whether you remember that incident but that was the end of the saumarez you weren't on board though were you no i'd left that was in october i left her in february before that did you feel for her when she went yes it was a happy ship absolutely yes indeed we maintained contact several reunions over the years but again as one would expect there are fewer and fewer of us left so no more reunions and how do you reflect on the war now something that must not be forgotten particularly from the angle of the japanese who were carried out some as you probably some horrific actions the germans were more disciplined and good seamen but er i think that they these things must never be forgotten i'd just hate to think what might happen if anything major turned up in the future
