DIFFERENT LENGTHS AND WE LEARNED MORSE CODE SEMIPHORE EM TO SIGNAL WITH FLAGS YOU KNOW LIKE THE OLD NELSON SIGNAL WHICH KEPT CHANGING LEARNING THE PHONETIC ALPHABET WHICH HALFWAY THROUGH OUR COURSE CHANGED SO THAT THE AMERICANS COULD UNDERSTAND IT WHICH ANNOYED US WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO CHANGE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS ANYWAY SO THE PHONETIC ALPHABET ERM EVERY CLASS WAS MANNED BY AN X SERVING MAN

WENT ON DUTY YOU KNOW AND I THOUGHT THIS IS CRAZY ALL THES SORT OF BUSINESS AT CABLA ALL THIS STRICT DISCIPLINE NAVAL DISCIPLINE NOBODY SEEMED TO BE BOTHERED OF O BUT IT I DON'T THINK OU THINK THAT THEY REALISED THERE WAS A WAR ON EXCEPT E COURSE THE CONVOYS COMING IN ERM I LIKED LIKED IT I LIKE SCOTLAND STEPHNEY DIDN'T LIKE IT IF YOU'RE READ IN HER BOOK IF YOU EVER READ IT ERM SHE JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO MIX IN VERY WELL WITH SCOTTISH PEOPLE BUT I HAD GOT A SCOTTISH GRANDFATHER PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT ISO I DID SORT OF ACCEPT IT MORE AND I REALISED THA YOU KNOW THEY ARE A BIT INSULAR AND THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO BE OFF PUTTING BUT THEY WERE OCOUSE THEY ITIS AN INSILAR LAND UP IN THE HIGHLANDS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THE HIGHLANDS VERY WELL THER ARE A THING NTO THEMSELVES OK WELL SO JUST DO ME A FAVOUR THEN JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT UM WHAT THE BASE WAS LIKE WHAT YOUR SURROUNDINGS LIKE WHERE YOU SLEPT ANDSHE E THIS IS OBEN A OBEN YE AN WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE WORK YES WELL OPEN FIRST OF ALL M I WAS STATIONED IN WHAT WAS CALLED THE STATION HOTEL AND THE SIGNAL STATION ON THE PEER WAS ONLY A SHORT WALK AWAY AND I MET UP WITH A GIRL WHO WAS GOING TO WORK WITH ME SHE'D BEEN THERE ABOUT A WEEK WE HADN'T YET STARTED REALLY GETTING THE CONVOYS IN SO WE WERE TOLD WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THAT ERM THE CONVOYS WOULD COME IN AND THEY'D BE IN THE BAY AND WE HAD TO MAN THEMANN THE SH MAN ALL THE TIME AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO ON ANY BOATS A THAT'S ANOTHER THE STORY ERM WE ERM HAD TO MMONITOR EVERYTHING COMING IN AND OUT WE ALSO HAD TO LOOK AFTER FUNNILY ENOUGH THE RM R A F HAD THEIR SUNDERLANDS AND CATALINAS UP THERE AND ERM THEY HAD A CALL SIGN WHICH CHANGED EVERY HOUR AND HALF OF THEM COULD NEVER EVER READ IT SO WE USED TO HAVE TO READ THEIR CO SIGNAL FOR THEM TO SEND THEIR PATROL BOLGOUT BUT THAT WAS UNBEKNOWN TO OUR BASE WHO NEVER HAD A CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON IT WAS A CRAZY SET UP REALLY AND ERM THE SUBMARINES ON PATROL DUTY USED TO COME IN ALONGSIDE THE PEER ANDWE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THEM THEIR SIGNALS ERM THEY WERE IMAGOUT ON PATROL THAT WAS MOSTLY WHAT WE WERE DOING AT THE PIER SIGNAL STATION ERM BUT THIS WASN'T ADEQUATE ENOUGH AN GANAVAN SIGNAL STATION WHICH WAS RIGHT ROUND THE CORNER FROM WHERE WE WERE WAS STILL MANNED BY THE MEN AND THEY ALSO HAD A NEW ASDIC CENTRE OPENING UP JUST BELOW WHICH WAS RADAR AN ALSDICK ERM IT WAS STILL DONE BY THE MEN AND THE MEN WERE GOING FROM GAGNAVON AND THEY WERE GOING OVER TO LISMORE THE WRENS WEREN'T ALLOWED UP THERE BECAUSE THERE WASNOIT WAS COMPLETELY ALONE OUT THERE YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO INHABITATION O SAKTWAS A FEW FA FEW SHEEP FARMERS SO THE WRENS WEREN'T ALLOWED T OUP IN LISMORE AND THAT'S WHERE THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN HAN'T BEEN KNOWING TO ANYBODY ERM SO THE GANGERVON SIGNAL STATION WAS GOING TO OPEN UP AND WE WERE GOING TO GO THERE WHICH MEANT VERY GREAT DIFFICULTY BECAUSE FROM THE STATION HOTEL TO GANNEVON IT WAS ABOUT A COUPLE OF THREE MILES TWO OR THREE MILES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT'S NO JOKE ERM SO EVENTUALLY I WAS THERE FOR ABOUT PER SIGNAL STATION FOR ABOUT I WOULD SAYABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE GANEVON WAS OPEN GANGEVAN SIGNAL STATION WAS THEN OPENED UP FOR THE WRENS AND WE TOOK OVER FROM THE MEN N WE HAD AN INTAKE THEN OF MORE VS WRENS SO THERE WERE NOW SIX OF US INSTEAD OF FOUR AND WE TOOK OVER GANEVAN FROM THE MEN VERY VERY SPARTAN WHEN WE WERE AT THE PEER SIGNAL STATION WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE MEALS WITH IN THE MESS PROPER MEALS ERM WHEN WE WERE ON NIGHT WATCH THEY WOULD DO US UP NICE SANDWICHES WHEN WE MOVED FROM PIER SIGNAL STATION TO THE GANEVIN SIGNAL STATION WE WERE STATIONED AT A PLACE CALLED RASEI LODGE WHICH WAS VERY TOUGH GOING ERM THEY DIDN'T LIKE WATCHKEEPERS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T HANDLE US NEARLY ALL NEARLY WHALE OF THE RM WRENNERY WAS WRITERS OR WT OPERATORS WHO WORKED PROPER WATCH OURS THEY WERED NINE TIL FIVE NOT US WE HAD YOU KNOW WE HAD TO DO I WATCH KEEPING HOURS SAME AS THE NAVY SO IF YOU WERE LUCKY YOU GET A HOT DINNER IF YOU DIDN'T YOU JUST HAD A SARDEE IN SANDWICH SO THE FOOD WAS PRETTY SPARSE IF YOU READ IN THE BOOK EOPLE MY FRIENDS WHO READ THE BOOK SAY WHY DID YOU STAND IT UI SAID BUT THERE WAS A WAR ON WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTI DIFFERENT WE HAD TO GO DO IT WAS OUR JOB THE MEN IT WAS IT WAS A VERY VERY SPARSE SIGNAL STATION ERM SHALL YOU WANT ME TO DESCRIBE IT TO A POTHE SIGNAL STATION ITSELF WAS RIGHT ON THE TOP OF OF GANAVAN ON JUST BY DONL DANOLEY HOUSE WHICH IS THE HOUSE OF THE ERM LOYALN LADY OF MDODL I THINK THEY WERE CAUGHT YES MCDOODAL AND IT WAS ON THEIR LAND AND IT HAD BEEN BUILT AS A LOOKOUT POST I THINK ORIGINALLY FOR THE COASTGUARDS IT WAS A VERY SPARSE IT WAST A TWO TIER PLACE YOU HAD TO REACH IT BUT TO GET TO IT IT WAS A CLIMB UP A CLIFF ALMOST A SHEER CLIFF THE ROAD WENT BELOW US AND THE SHEER CLIFF UP WHICH WE HAD TO CARRY THE OLDEST LAMP BATTERIES WHICH WAS VERY HEAVY AND THEN ERM WE HAD TO HAVE AFERM A COAL FIRE AY BECAUSE WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO BURN ANY CONFIDENTIAL BOOKS WHICH WE HAD IF ANYTHING IF WE HAD ANY KIND OF N INVASION ERM WE HAD TO PUT THE BOOKS O GOODNESS KNOWS HOW BECAUSE THEY WERE LEAD LINE THEY WERE STATE FROMBUT WE THATWHILE WE HAD THE FIE ERM WE HAD A BUNK DOWN BELOW E SIGNAL UP THE TOP AND IW TE BALCONY ALL AROUND WE HAD A BIG TEN INCH THREE AUDICE LAMPS ERM AN ARTY AN RT SET AND IT WAS REALLY JUST GO YOU KNOW THAT WAS IT WE JUST PUSHED IT AT THE DEEP END ERM AND HOW FAR COULD YOU SEE FROM THERE I MEAN WHAT WAS YOUR WECOULD SEE LITERALLY WHERE SHE GOT IT WE COULD SEE RIGHT FRO WE COULD SEE MUL RIGHT THE WAY DOWN TO MUL OVER TO LISMORE WELL WE HAD PERFECT VISION ERM OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS COMING AND GOING WHY WAS THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT STRETCH OF COASTLINE IN TERMS OF THE CONVOYS ANYOR E BE BECAUSE ERM IT WAS VERY SAFE ERM THOUGHT ERM THEY COULD COME IN IT WASIF YOU COULD HAVE A LOOK AT TE MAP ERM IRE WAS A COMPLETE BAY AND TOBER MORREY THE ESCORT SHIPS ERM USUALLY ABOUT TWO OR THREE DESTROYERS WOULD DROP THE CONVOY OFF AND GO UP TO TOBER MORREY ERM THEY WOULD GO UP UP THESOUND O MUL EM IF YOU COULD VISUALIZE THAT COASTLINE MUL ALMOST PROTECTS THE BAY SO ANY SHIPS PASSING HAVE TO GO ROUND BEHIND TE MUL THEY DON'T REALIZE YOU KNOW IAS COMING IN THAT'S ANOTHER STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK ERM I THINK IT WAS A VERY SAFE HAVEN ERM THEY THEY CAME IN ERM THEY WERE ESCORTED OFF FROM US PROBABLY DOWN TO EM GIRLOCK WOULD GO INTO THE CLYDE FOR UNLOADING OR THEY WOULD MASS UP READY TO GO OUT EWA EITHER ANE ETA OF ARRIVAL OR AN EXPECTED TIME OF DISPATCH THEY WERE EITHER COMING OR GOING AND WHAT WAS THE MOST SHIPS YOU THINK YOU EVER SAW THEM I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE HARBOUR WOULD BE FULL I WOULD SAY THIRTY MORE THAN THAT YES THIRTY MOST LIKELY AND OF COURSE YOU'D HAD YOU HAVE A LIST AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW YOU THINKO THEY MIGHT BE A STRAGGLER BUT THEY WEREN'T THEY NEVER CAME YOU KNOW YOU'D HAV THAT WAS THE TERRIBLE THING YOU THINK E WONDERED WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ONE EM WE HAD QUITE A LOT OF LOSSES UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN ENOT IN THE BAY BUT YOU KNOW COMING AND GOING YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE THE E YE BECAUSE WE HAVE WE' HAVE A LIST SENT TO US WHICH WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL LIST AN EXPECTED TIME OF ARRIVAL AND YOU'D GIVE THEM ABOUT TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT NEVER CAME YOU KNOW YOU JUST WONDER WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WERE ALL MANNED BY ERM MOSTLY MERCHANT MERCHANTMEN SO THEIR MORSE WASN'T VERY GOOD BUT NOW AND AGAIN YOU'D GET A A SHIP WHICH HAD A FEW NAVE KS ERM UNITED STATES WHEN WHEN AMERICA CAME IN IT WAS BETTER PLANNED YOU KNOW THE LIBERTY SHIPS CAME THEN AND THEY WERE ER RBETTER MANNED THEY WERE ERM A LITTLE BIT OVERPOWERING REALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO SHALL I SAY THIS OVER CLEVER THEY USED TO SEND MOR AT THE RATE OF KNOTS THINKING THAT WE COULDN'T ANSWER IT ANDTHEN WE WOULD SEND BACK AT THE SAME RATE ERM THIS IS WHY WE DIDN'T LIKE THE AMERICANS VERY MUCH I'M AFRAID ERM THEY TRIED ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY TRED TO COME UP UP TO OUR SIGNAL STATION AND WE COULDN'T HAVE THEM INWERE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM IN WE HAD ONE OR TWO PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE COMING UP ERM ONE SHALL I GO ON YEH ONE NIGHT ERM I COULD HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE THING AND A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW THIS VOICE I DIDN'T UNDERKN WHO IT WAS T WAS A MAN'S VOICE WE ALREADY HAD M A WREN MURDERED IN VERARI A VS WREN MURDERED IN VERARI ON NIGHT WATCH SO WE WERE ALL VERY WARM OH BYWHICH INAN INTERSPE WE ALL WERE TAUGHT HOW TO HANDLE A PISTOL WE HAD TO GO ON THE RANGE WHICH WAS ERM THE RAF HAD A RANGE AND WE WERE TAKEN ONTO THE RANGE BY AN INSTRUCTOR AND TALK TO FIRE PISTOL AND ICAME T VERY SMALL RISKS AND I WAS TAUGHT TO FIRE HOLDING MY WRIST SO I COULD FIRE IT MY WRIST WE ALSO HAD A RIFLE UP IN THE SIGNAL STATIONIT WASN'T LOADED THERE WAS NO AMMUNITION IN IT BUT THE PISTOLS WERE AT THATBUT THIS RIFLE WASN'T LOADED IT WAS JUST THERE AS AS A WARNING I HEARD THISE FOOTSTEPSN THIS IS PERFECTLY TRUE I HEARD THISE FOOTSTEPS COMING UP AND I SAID TO MY OPO I DON'T LIKE THIS VERY MUCH SO THIS B KEPT KNOCKING ON THE DOOR IN THE END II CUGHT THIS RIFLE AND I THOUGHT NO I CAN'T I KNEW IT WAS UNLOADED AND I THOUGHT NO WHAT AM I GOING TO DO SO I PUT IT SIT UP THE OTHER WAY AND AS THIS VOICE CAME THROUGH THE THING I LIFTED IT UP AND WAS GOING TO CLOGG HIM ON THE HEAD WITH IT HE SAID IT'S ALRIGHT JONE IT'S ONLY ME AND IT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNALMEN FROM DOWN BELOW STUPID WHO'D GOT A DATE I HAD CHANGED WATCHES WITH A GIRL I SHOULDN'T TEL TO TELL E THIS REALLY HE OBVIOUSLY USED TO COME UP FOR A CUP OF TEA AT THIS TIME AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH HER AND HE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON WATCH AND HE NEARLY GOT HIMSELF KILLED AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE IN MY RIGHTS BECAUSE WEN NOBODY HAD GOT A GREAT BIG PROHIBITIVE NISANCE UP ON THE DOOR BUT IM YOU KNOW IT NEVE NEVER EVER CAME TO ANYTHING AND I NEVER EVER REPORTED IT BECAUSE I WE I GOT HIM INTO TERRIBLE TROUBLE BUT WE WERE ARMED BUT ONLY WITH A PISTOL AND HD A RIFLE WITH NO AMMUNITION BECAUSE WED HAD A A WRENT IN INVORARI WHAT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T KNOW I'M AFRAID ALL THAT IS A NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WE WERE JUST TOLD TO BE VERY AWARE AND ITOULD TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS AND I THINK M STEPHNEY MENTIONS THIS IN OUR BOOK AS WELL WE NEVER EVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED MEAN WE HAD WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A SPY O A MAN USED TO COME DOWN IT WAS ALL PROHIBITED LAND FOR CIVILIANS BUT THIS MAN USED TO COME DOWN SIT ON THE ROCKS WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS AND HE HAD BANOCLAS AND A CAMERA WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CONVOYS WE COULD TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AROUND THE CABIN AND AROUND THE THING BUT NOT A CONVOYS NOT ALLOWED TO AND SO WE REPORTED THIS MAN TO OUR HEADQUARTERS O NOW SIGNALBACK IN THE STATION HOTEL NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ABOUT IT SO HE JUST DISAPPEARED NO WE NEVER EVER HEARD WHETHER IT WAS JUST A LOCAL NEWSPAPER MAN OR WHETHER HE WAS AGON KIND OF A SPY OR WHETHER HE WAS JUST INTERESTED IN SHIPS WE NEVER HEARD I'M AFRAID IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS ALL NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD AND JUST YOU KNOW JUST PICKING UP ALL THE AMERICANS WHAT YOE YOU WERE SORT OF TALKING ABOUT STORY BECAUSE THE AMERICANS GAVE YOU SOME HASSLE ERM YES WELL THEY WOULD TRYING TO BRIBE US THEY WANTED TO COME UP THE SIGNAL STATION ERM LOOK EN HOW LOOK HONNEY WE'VE GOT SOME NILONS OR HONEY WE'VE GOT BANANAS ON BOARD YOU KNOW THEY I MEAN SO STUPID AND SO CHILDISH WE TOOK A DISLIKE TO THEM WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE WAS THE WAY THEY USED TO TREAT THEIR OFFICERS COMPLETE DISRESPECT THEY WOULD CALL THEM BY THEIR FIRST NAMES WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS TERRIBLE AND THE CAPTAINS AND ALL THE E OFFICERS NEVER SEEMED TO TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THEM WE WERE IN URBORN ONE DAY SHOPPING AND THE AMERICANS CAME ON BOARDCAME ON POVERCY SHOPPING AS WELL AND ERM WE HAD TO TAKE US FOR A CUP OF COFFEE OK FINE WHICH THEY DID WE TOOK THEM TO THE Y MC A AND WE HAD A CUP OF COFFEE GOING BACK SOME OF THEIR OFFICERS WERE COMING THE OTHER WAY WE WERE APPALLED THE WAY THEY SPOKE NO SALUTING HI P HIA CAP I THOUGHT THIS IS TERRIBLE I MEAN I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT IT WAS JUST ANOTHER WORLD AWAY AND THEY WERE TRYING TO BRIBE US WITH BANANAS AND ENILOMS AND WEJUST DIDN'T YOU KNOW DIDNT AN TRENO WE THOUGHT IT WAS TOO CHILDISH WIT ALL THIS VERY FAST FLASHING MORCE YOU TOUCHED ON THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF ERM YOU KNOW COMMUNICATION YOU HAD THE SEMAFOR YOU HADYOU TALKED ABOUT THE LAMPS THERE YEH ALLIT WER THER SO JUST WHEN DID YOU USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNICATION YEIS IT ONE SPECIFIC TYPE INOBA IN THE STATION YE ALWAYS BY MORCE BY LIGHT OR SOMETIMES BY RT ERM NEARLY ALWAYS THE ART WE WE REALLY ONLY USED FOR THE ASDECK STATION ERM LAMP MOSTLY THE OLDEST AND ALL THE BIG TEN INCH WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT OF COURSE TO HANDLE YOU HAD TO GO OUT ON THE BOW AND OF COURSE UP THERE THE WINDS WERE ALWAYS AT GALE FORCE AND WE ALWAYS HAD TO HOIST TETHE CONES FOR TE FOR THE WEATHER EVERY DAY WE HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOR THE CONVOYS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER WAS WHAT WERE THE CONES THE CONES WERE Y THE COME WAS A SHAPE LIKE THAT AND YOU HOISTED IT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH WAY NOW UPWARDS FOR UPWARDS FOR THE NORTH WIND AND DOWNFWARDS FROR THE SOUTH WIND VERY PRIMITIVE BUT IT GAVE THEM SOME IDEA OF THE WAV THE WIND I MEAN ITANOTHER THING O MEAN YOU COULD TELL THE WAY THE WIND WAS BLOWIN JUST LOOK AT THE ENSRIM WHICH WE ALWAYS HAD TO FLY THE WHITE ENSRIM AND WE HAD TO BIDE BY THE COLOURS OF THE WHITE ENSIM PUT IT UP AT SUNRISE AND DOWN AT SUNSET SO THE ENSRIM WAS ALWAYS FLYING SO YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHICH WAY THE WIND WAS GBLOWING WITHOUT THE CONE BUT IT WAS A GALE FORCE WIND BUT WE USED TO PUT THE CON UP WHICH SOMETIMES MEANT THE COME WAS UP FOR DAYS CAUSE THE GALES WOULD BLOW UP THERE VERY VERY VERY WINDY AND SOMETIMES WE WOULD HAVE TO BE LASHED ONTO THE TEN INCH QI BY OUR OPO BECAUSE IT WAS SO WINDY YOU KEPT BEING BLOWN AWAY IT WAS IT WAS VERY VERY COLD AND WEVERY VERY WE WERE ALWAYS WET BUT WE DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER DIDYOU HAVE DID YOU HAVE A BATH OR A SHOWER UP THERE OH WHEN WE WENT BACK TO THE ERM HOW LONG WOULD YOU BE SSITUATED UP THERE THEN WELL THE NIGHT WATCH WAS A LONG ONE WE'D GO ON SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT O'CLOCK ANDCOME OFF AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING THAT WAS A VERY LONG ONE ERM THE OTHER WATCHS WERE PRETTY WELL FOUR HOURS ON AND FOUR HOURS OFF BUT THE NIGHT WATCH WA WAS A TOUGH ONE BUT YOUAND YOU HAD TO WALK THERE AND BACK FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO WALK WE COULDN'T BE OBJECTED BECAUSE THE MAN MEN IN THE ESDIC STATION DOWN BELOW US GOT TRANSPORT THEY WERE WORKING IN THE SAME WATCHES OH WELL YES OK THEN THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD ISSUE US WITH BICYCLES WHICH THEY DID ERM WE HAD A WREN OFFICER CAME UP TO SEE US AND SHE SAID THIS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND THEN THEY SUPPLIED TRANSPORT FOR US SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK THE NIGHT WATCH BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS OF THREE OR FOUR MILES IN THE PITCH DARK ALONG ALL THE COAST ROAD BUT FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO BEFORE THEY REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING E THAT'S AMAZING E A STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK TEYES THE DUKE OF YORK WE NEVER HAD THE VERY BIG SHIPS THE BIGGEST SHIP ERM ESCORT SHIP THAT EVER REALLY CAME INTO US WEERE DESTROYERS OR OR OVCOWETTS ERM BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS USED TO GO INTO MAL TO WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS TO GO BACK OUT SO WE NEVER REALLY HAD ANYTHING WHAT I WOULD CALL VERY LARGE I WAS ON WATCH WITH STEPHNEY ERM ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION AND IF YOU CAN PICTURE THE ISLANDS AND THE SEA AND SOME OF THERE YOU SEE A GREAT BIG CROSS ANCHOR CROSS MAST COMING ACTU THINKING WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE DWE HAD NO ETA FOR ANYTHING WE HAD NOTHING WHATEVER IS IN E WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLYYOU KNOW IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT OFCOURSE WE CALLED IT UP DNO REPLY DOF COURSE THAT WAS WORRYING NO REPLY BECAURSE IT WAS A SPECIAL EVERY HOUR IT CHANGED THE CALL UP SIGN CHANGED ON A CODE BOOK SO YOU WOULD CALL THEM UP BY THE CODE WHICH IT WAR FOR THE DAY AND NO REPLY SO WE HAD A LITTLE SHIP WE HAD TWO SHIPS ACTUALLY ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN STAR ANONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN WAVE AND THEY WERE PATROL SHIPS WHICH USED TO PATROL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AMONG THE CONVOYS ALL THE TIME THEY WERE OLD WHAT I WOULD CALL SOMETHING LIKE A CORVETTE EM I THINK THEY WERE OLD TRAWLERS BUT THEY WERE MANNED BY ERM NAVY AND THEY WERE IF ANY TROUBLE WE CALL THEM UP IMMEDIATELY AND THEN WE CALLED UP THE SOUTHERN STAR SHE WAS WAY OUT OVER A MILE AND ASKED HER WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHE SAID I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING FROM HERE BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE IN A WAY WAY BUT SHE SAID I'LL GO AND INVESTIGATE SHE SAID IF IT'S ANYTHING TROUBLE I'LL PUT A SHOT ACROSS ITS BOWS THAT WAS THAT ANYWAY THIS THING GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER EVENTUALLY I MANAGED TO CALL UP OBVIOUSLY THE BUNTING TOSSER THAT'S WHAT VISUAL SIGNALS A'RE CALLED BUNTING TOSSERS WAS ASLEEP I SHOULD THINK HE THOUGHT OH WEL WE'RE ONLY CARISING ROUND THESE ISLANDS AND HE CAME BACK QUICKLY WITH D OF Y INSTEAD OF A PENNENT NUMBER BECAUSE ALL SHIPS HAVE PENECK NUMBERS EITHER THE PENNENT NUMBER OF THE SHIP OR THE COD WE CAME BACK WITH NOTHING QUICKLY D OF WHY AND I SAID TO STEPHNEY D OF WHY DUKE OF YORK SAID GOSH IT'S A BATTLESHIP I SAID BASE DON'T KNOW SO WE QUICKLY PHONED OUR BASE ND THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE US CAUS NOBODY HAD GOT ON ETA ANYWAY THE CAPTAIN OF THE OUR CAPTAIN THE BASE CAME RUSHING DOWN TOOK HIM ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO GET TO US BY WHICH TIME SHE WAS IN FULL VIEW MASSY F IT JUST FILLED UP THE WHOLE OF THE BAY I'V NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT AND OF COURSE IT WAS A GREAT BIG HUHAR ABOUT THIS WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW OF COURSE SHE WAS ON SHE WAS ON PILGRIMAGE UP TO NORWAY AFTER THE ERMASHARNHOIST AND SHE WAS DOING THIS TO EMI SUPPOSE SHE THOUGHT OH WEVE GOT CHIME TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DID IT THEY WERE WAY OFF COURSE I MEAN IT BE NOTHING W EVER SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN THE IT WAS WAY VERY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS OUT THERE BUT SHE DID SHE CAME RIGHT PAST US SAILING JUST OFF MULL I MEAN I COULD SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE SHE WAS IT WAS THAN THAT ERM SHE JUST APPEARED BEING THE ISLAND AS IF IT WAS ON SOME KIND OF A FILM IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND IT WAS SORT OF THING YOU DREAM ABOUT LOVELY STORY LOVELY STORY BUT NOBODY EVER REALLY AGAIN O NEED TO KNOW WE NEVER REALLY FOUND OUT WE REALISED AFTERWARDS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHE WERE ON HER WAY UP TO THE BATTLE IN YOUR WAY DRINK OF TEA PLEASE ER D DAY O YES ERMWEN D DA CAME WE HAD ALL TE SHIPS WE HAD WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT WHY THEY LOOKED SO DREADFUL THEY WERE ALL SORT OF BATTERED SHIPS WE THOUGHT WELL WEED SEEN SOME AWFUL SIGHTS BUT ETHEYE WERE ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY OF THEM I SHOULD THINK WITH TWO DESTROYERS DURBAN AND SOMETHING ELSE NONE WAS THE DURBAN SOMTHING MAYBE I'VE WRITTEN MAYBE SHE MENTIONED THEM IN THE BOOK ANYWAY AND WE THOUGHT GOS I DESTROYER DOESN'T THINK WE O AS A TERRIBLE STATE SURELY THE NAVY KNOW THEYWERE I WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE THEY CAME IN I SUPPOSE THEY WERE IN ABOUT A WEEK OR MORE THAN THAT TEN DAYS ENOUGH TIME FOR STEPHNEY TO GET TO KNOW THIS SIGNAL AN AND THEY SAIDW MUST BE TEN DAYS ERM WE STILL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WERE IN SUCH AND WHY THEY DIDN'T BECAUSE THEY ONLY EVER STAYED FO TWO OR THREE DAYS BUT THEYS SEEMED TO BE A LONG TIME AND WE THOUGHT HELLOW SOMETHINGS SOMETHINGS GOING ON THEN ALL OUR WE WERE TOLD WEWERE NOT ALLOWED TO POST ANY MORE LETTERS ALL HOUR LETTERS WERE TO BE CANCE ALL THOUR POSTAGE OUT WAS TO BE CANCELLED EVERYTHING GOING OUT FROM THE BASE WAS TO BE STOPPED AND WE ALL LEAVE WAS STOPPED AND WE THOUGHT SOMETHING'S IN THE AIR YOU KNOW YOU GET THAT FEELINGERM WE THOUGHT WLL WHERE ARE THEY GOING WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO OF COURSE THEY WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS URM ONE NIGHT BEFORE D DAY THE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT OR SO THEY SET ERM THE NIGHT BEFORE ERMHEWE ALL SEEMED TO BE GETTING READY THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG SHIP CAME ALONGSIDE SOME OF THEM AND TOOK OF A LOT OF STUFF ADWE THOUGHT THEY DON'T USUALLY UNLOAD HERE IT GOES TO GOROCK AND GREANOCK WHERE THEY WERE UNLOADING ALL SORTS OF STUFF AWE WATCHED THEM THROUGH THE TELESCOPE YOU KNOW CHAIRS AND TABLES AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS WERE COMING UP WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS KNO NO NEXT DAY WEEWHEN WE CAME UP ON WATCH THEY WERE ALL BUSY GETTING READY TO GO OUT ANDWE HAD NO EXPECTED TIME OF DEPARTURE AT ALL THEY ALL JUST SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR OUR TWO PATROL SHIPS HAD NO IDEA THEY SAID WHAT DO WE DO WHER THEY'RE GOING WHEWHAT WE D WE HAD WE COULDN'T TELL THEM OF COURSE IT WAS SO SECRET AND THAT'S THE END OF THE D DAY THAT WAS ALL THE BLOCK SHIPS GOING DOWN THEY WERE ALL ROTTEN OLD SHIPS AT NOBODY WANTED THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD BEEN SO BATTLED SCARRED THAT THEY WERE ALMOST UNSINKABLE TINKABL SO THEY WERE THE TWO BIG BLOCK SHIPS AND THESE WERE SENT JOHN TO HELP OUT AND WE NEVER EVER HEARD UNTIL THE END OF THE WAR WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT ADTHESE OBVIOUSLY THE WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS THING HA YOU TOUCHED ON EARLIER BUT I'D LIKE MORE CLARIFICATION ON IS IS THE CONVOYS ESSENTIALLY YOU DID TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTATION SO CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN AGAIN FOR ME YOU KNOW HOW THE PROCESS A DISPATCH RIDER WOULD ARRIVE FROM BASE FOR THE STATION HOTEL WHICH IS THEIR BASE STHATCH BRIDER WOULD ARRIVE WITH A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH WOULD CONTAIN ET A OF THE NEXT CONVOY COMING IN AND RIGHT SO YOU THEN GET IT OUT PUT IT IN FRONT OF YOU PUT IT UP AND WAIT FOR THE FIRST ONE LITERALLY TO COME IN ET EG O NINE HUNDRED YOU KNO PERHAPS THEY WOULDN'T START TO COME INTI O NINE THREE HUNDRED THEY'D OBVIOUSLY BEEN MARKED I SUPPOSE I THINK FROM IRELAND THEY WERE THEN SORT OF ERM MARKED ACROSS THEY WOULD GET THE ETA OF THEM COMING ACROSS E THAT WAS LITERALLY HOW WE GOT THEETAS FROM A DISPATCH WRIDERA CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WOULD COME ERM I SUPPOSE THEY AD ABOUT EVERY THE CONVOYS WERE COMING IN QUITE REGULARLY AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH COMING IN BY THE TIME THEY'D GONE OUT AGAIN THE BAY WAS ALWAYS REALLYNEW ALWAYS CHOCABLOK THEN OF COURSE YOU GOT ALSO GOT THE R A F BOATS GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WATH ER SUNDERLAND AND THEYER ERM
