what did you do to keep yourself happy i mean how how easy was it to be a happy sailor when you are in in these situations or is it do you do you get tough to it well it bends abut you want to do i mean we we were for as a cadets we were faring together when i was third officer i had my own cabin and then i used to i took a portable type write and then had to type you know and write letters and things like that and then we had the library on board you read books and the you couldn't get the radio and you couldn't transmit but the am the in the radio cabin they had one on the radio they could listening to news we got and yes sometimes we didn't always get it but you couldn't listen in and we had no tape we call us in those days we the gramophones were the all wind up ones you know every people used to play cards and things like that you know and sit on deck in a nice day and read a book that was very very wonderful you know when the weather was fine did i ask you about burial at sea ask about burial say did you ever have any yes we did yet and we were we were actually we were scared of yellow fever and so before we left port we were given in injections against yellow fever but am one of the people got it was a cocatually he got yellow fever from the injection and we had no doctor on board and there's no one else we could go and he died so we had the we're on our own we did we went in combo then say we had the burial and it was very impressive the ship was stopped now traditionally the corpse was put in canvas and you put weights in the bottom and the old iron bars or cold or something like that and you sowed the corpse up and this job was done by the the boson and the carpenter that was the petitioners well and the last stitch was taken through the nose to make sure he was really dead and then the there was a hatch board on the boat bunkers of the ship with a flag over it and the body was underneath it was called the snatching back of the ensin then the captain would come down and the crew would assemble and we had prayers and committals and there was a proper sort of form for this and and then at the appropriate moment the captain would give the signal and the seamen would hold out to the flag lift up the hatch board and the body would slide out into the sea very nice and that was a burial at sea the only one we had but that was one the other one was in the life boat we didn't have any we just said pressed me but the body over we couldn't sew it up or anything i mean are there any other stories that you want to share about your your naval time am as well it's rather an amusing one and now when we were cadets there were four cadets and the the senior one and now the third officer got sick so we had to leave him ashore and the senior cadet was promoted acting third officer it was a good friend of mine so we were then three in our cabin and he had a special cabin on his own but a on one particular occasion i was painting outside you had a paint the ship every three months and i was painting around there and he had his feet sticking out of the port hole you see i couldn't resist the temptation so i painted his feet gray i got he very serious to me was a good friend of mine so he rushed out and with a paint pot and the people between we both covered and great painted now his wife got in touch with me and she remembered that incident because he told her he he died a few years ago but she's been in touch with me as well through this a broadcast and she remembered that that was a very amusing incident her she was actually in in detroit by then she was a passenger we had from malta to united states and he was quite young and i used to chat with her she was quite alone and i went to see her family in detroit member new york and we kept up a correspondence so we did we read very close but it was the sort of know that kind of relationship and i remember in new york another rather interesting observation am we were invited to the stork club which is very famous in those days for actors and people like that you know and a several members of the crew went in and there we were given a standing welcome by the the people there and they were singing robert and you and so you know it was very very nice to find that and then one of the guys said that he'd take us to meet shirley temple but he never did but so now we were given no quite a lot of amos if you like one of the other rather sad ones was so a young man named gilchrist who was with me on one of my trips and the next trip he went on a different ship and nothing was heard of it and it had was torpedoed and it was in a storm and eventually died and i forgot the details in my memoirs but i i went to see his family in in ireland they lived in a ad glass hatchly to make my him in commiserations you know because it was very very sad when you know somebody and you know the people there am so that was another incident actually but that was completely different a funny one when when do you remember the end of the war did you know the end of the war was humming did you sense it well you see we had very little news and we were in the indian ocean when final finally ended the war against japan and then i we had about it on the radio then but you know we didn't know much what was going on in north africa or in germany and so we didn't get much news and we were a long way away and then i want some trips were very long nine in ten months sometimes you know you'd be away all that time and you and letters the the people you couldn't just letters would be censored you couldn't say where you were and you had to send until they a main post office you see and they would forward them and then letters that we had received we had to be sent to the main g p office and they would put them to the admiralty to know where the ship wilson and send them out you know so is hidden miss to lord's extent you didn't get much information was there a celebration on board yeah we had a celebration then we had some wine and things like that you know we usually had a bit of a christmas party on ships as well if we could we had christmas pudding and things like that you know but the a there were limits on drink i mean they were very very strict on drink but fortunately you didn't want people to be drunk after i am so you had a bar but you couldn't you couldn't get unlimited supplies but cigarettes were dead cheap of course so everybody was smoking so i had to give that up later on
