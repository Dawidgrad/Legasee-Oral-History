MY NAME IS JOHN DOUGLAS WOODWOOD IAM EIGHTY NINE YEARS OLD I WAS BORN ON THE SEVENTH OF APRIL NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR WHEN IN THE SERVICE I HAD ORIGINALLY JOINED TO BE A SIGNALER AND THEY FOUND OUT I WAS COLOR BLIND SO I WAS AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE STEWARDING BRANCH WHICH I DIDN'T WANT BUT YOU HAD NO CHOICE YOU DID WHAT YOU WERE TOLD AND I GOT TRANSFERRED TO MINE SWEEPERS AND E I WAS BASED ON THE ISLAN SHIP HERE AT QUEENSBOROGH QUEENSLAND QUEENBOROGH PEER AND WE HAD ABOUT A TEN MINS FEBER THERE AND WE WENT OUT EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS TO SWEEP ANY MINDS THAT HAD BEEN DROPPED BY THE BOATS IN THE HOPE OF SINKING OUR SUPPLY SHIPS COT WHY DID YOU JOIN THE NAVY BECAUSE I WANTED TO GIV EM THE FIGHT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND AT THE TIME I WAS A WHAT THEY CALLD IN A RESERVED OCCUPATION I WAS AN APPRENTICE AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER AND MY DAD DIDN'T WANT ME TO DO EM TO JOIN UP EPERS IN THE LAST WAR AND HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED ME TO LEARN A GOOD STEADY TRADE BUT I WANTED TO GO SO AS SOON AS I WAS EIGHTEEN I WENT OVER FROM MAIDSTONE WHERE OUR HOME WAS I CAME OVER TO CHATTAM TO PEMBROKE BARROCKS AND A SIGNED UP I SAID I WAS NINETEEN BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE I JUST ACCEPTED YOU IF YOU COULD A BREATHE IN OUT AND MOVE YOUR ARMS YOU ERE PHYSICALLY FIT I WAS TOLD TO GO HOME AND WAIT AND I'D BE CONTACTED AND ABOUT A WEEK LATER THE ONVELOPE CAME REPORTS AT CHATAMN BARRACKS ON SUCH AND SUCH A DAY I WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE WAR WITHOUT ACTUALLY SEEING A GERMAN WE HAD A LONG RAGED FIGHTS WITH THEM BUT I NEVER ACTUALLY SAW A GERMAN BUT JOK WHAT WHY DYOU KNOW YOU WANTED TO DO YOUR BIT BUT WHY DID YOU NOT JOIN THE ARMY OR THE ARIE NOT INTERESTED IN EITHER TS A TRADITIONAL FAMILY MY FATHER WAS IN THE NAVY SO WAS MY GRANDFATHER AND AN UNCLE MY GRANDFATHER WAS ON BEATING HIS FLAGSHIP THE LIN AT THE BATTLE OF JATLAND AND HE DIDN'T COME ON DECK FOR THREE DAYS HE WAS IN THE ENGINEERING BRANCH BUT A THAT'S THE SERVICE I WANTED TO JOIN SO I DID AD WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF YOUR TRAINING AH RATHE IT'S RATHER CONFUSED WHEN YOUARE YOUNG AND YOU DON'T AM TAKE THINGS IN SO EASILY BUT FROM A PEMBROKE HOUSE PEMBROKE BARRACKS WE WERE ALL MARCHED DOWN TO THE A FURTHER DOWN THE YARD WERE WE GOT FITTED OUT AND AT THAT TIME EEVERYONE A LESSOF AN OFFICER WARE THE SAME FOR AN ALFT WRIG WITH BELL BOTTOMS THE SCARF AND THE AN THE A THE HAT SENT UP TO SCAGNESS WITH ANOTHER BUNCH TO BUTLIN'S HOLIDY CAMP AND THAT BECAME ACH AM S ROYAL ARTHUR AND I WAS TO START AM TRAINING TO THE TELEGRAPHIST SIGNALLER AD I' BEEN DOING MORS CODE STARTED ON THE MORS COADE FOR ABOUT A FORTNIGHT THEN SOMEBODY SAID IL THIS THIS LOT HAVEN'T HAD A A COLOTIST THEY'D BETTER HAVE IT MOST OF EM PASSED BUT TWO OTHERS AND ME WE'RE ALL STRONGLY COLORE BLIND SO YOU'RE OUT IF YOU SEND THE WRONG COLORS WHEN YOU'RE SIGNALLING IT COULD BE A DISASTER SO THAT'S WHEN I WAS TRANSFERRED ON TO MINE SWEEPERS ON THE STEWARDING BRANCH WERE YOU DISAPPOINTED YES NOBODY LIKED BEING ON MINDS FEVERS WE ALL KEPT PUTTING IN FOR TRANSFER TO SOMETHING MORE GLAMOROUS DESTROYERS SUBMARINES M T BS M G BS BUT ALWAYS GOT TURNED DOWN YOU'LL DO AN IMPORTANT JOB T YOU WILL STAY PUT AND THAT WAS IT HOW MANY PEOPLE ONE OF THESE MIND SWEEPERS A WHAT WAS THE SHIP IF THE BOAT LIKE A FIVE OFFICERS ANDE ABOUT E TWELVE FIFTEEN CREW THAT INCLUDES THE THE ENGINEERS OR THE STOKERS BRANCH THEY CALLE IT SIGNALLING AND A AND THOSE DOING THE ACTUAL MIND DETECTING WHEN WE FIRST STARTED WENT OUT MIND SWEEPING IT WAS A THREE DAYS ON ONE DAY OFF AND WE HAD TWO SEAMEN STANDING IN THE BOWS WITH RIFLES WHEN THEY SAW A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING BY THEY'D SHOOT AT IT HIT THE HORNS AND BLOW IT UP BUT THAT WAS WHEN THEY AM STARTED THE MINE SWEEPING CAMPAIGN AND THEY GERMANS WHEN THEY DROPPED THEM HAD LONG WEIGHTS ON WIRES SO THEY JUST FLOATED BELOW THE SURFACE TO HIT THE SHIP IF ONE OF THOSE WIRES CAME LOOSE THE MINE WOULD BOB ON THE SURFACE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOKED FOR EACH TIME WE WENT OUT WHEN THE GERMANS OCCUPIED FRANCE A COURSE GOT RIGHT ON THE COAST LINE AND THEY HAD BIG GUNS AT CAP GRINAY AND HE USED TO POP AWAY AT US EVERY TIME WE CAME OUT UNFORTUNATELY WE NEVER GOT HIT THERE WAS ONE AM AMUSING ANECDOTE OUR COMMODOR HAD BEEN A A SENIOR CAPTAIN BEFORE THE WAR AND HEHE RETIRED OF COURSE AND HE WAS BROUGHT BACK IN AND MADE COMMODOR OF THE MINE SWEEPING FLEET HE HAD HIS TWELVE MINE SWEEPERS AND WE USED O OT AND DO THE SAME THING EVERY DAY THE GERMAN'S BEING VERY MATICULOUS WOULD COME OUT WE'LL SAY FRIDAYS AND TUESDAYS NOT ONLY THE SAME DAY BUT THE SAME TIME TO LAY THEIR MINDS AND THEN DASHED BACK IN AND WE WENT OUT THE FOLLOWING MORNING EACH TIME TO PICK EM UP AND THE SKIPPER GOT A BIT FED UP WITH THIS AND AM HE TOLD THE CONFERENCE OF HIS CAPTAINS ONE DAY IS THE NEXT TIME WE GO SWEEPING RUN YOUR TROLLS OUT BUT DON'T DROP AT YOUR WIRES WHICH IS OF COURSE CONTRARY TO ALL NAVAL INSTRUCTIONS THAT E COULD HAVE GOT CAUGHT MARSAL IF ANY AMED BUT WE WENT THROUGH THE GERMAN MINEFIELD AS THEY'D LAID IT AND WE GOT AWAY WITH IT SO THE GERMANS CAME OUT AGAIN TO REPLACE THE MINES THEY THOUGHT WE'D PICKED UP AND THEY LOST FOUR OF THEIR OWN BOATS ON THEIR OWN MINEDS AND I DON'T THINK THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY SPORTING IS THAT DOCUMENTED COMMENTED SOMEWHERE IN THE ADMIRALTY ARCHIVES E ATHA GOOD IDEA HE COULD HAVE GOT INTO A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR THAT WHAT WAS YOUR ROLL WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN WE WENT OUT I WAS A DU TO REPORT WITH SIX OTHER STEWARDS WE REPORTED TO THE FIRST LIEUTENANT WER DAMAGED CONTROL PARTY IF THE SHIP GOT HIT WE HAD TO CLEAR THE DAMAGE AWAY PUT OUT ANY FIRES AND PULL THE WOUNDED INTO THE WARROOM WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS WAITING TO DO WHAT HE COULD BUT FORTUNATELY IT NEVER HAPPENED BUT THAT WAS MY OFFICIAL STATION AND WHAT ABOUT BAD WEATHER AND A STORMS AND STUFF DO YOU EVER ENCOUNTER ANY DANGERS WHEN YOU HAD WHAT ANY STORMS BAD WEATHER BIG SEAS OH WE HAD SOME YES BUT WE STILL WENT OUT YOU JUST PUT ON YOUR SOUTHWESTER AND AN THAT WAS IT WEU HAD SAFETY LINES RIGGED FOREAN ALPS SO YOU YOU HOLD ON TO THOSE YOU WOULDN'T GET WASHED OVERBOARD WHAT ABOUT WITITUDE WAS IT WS IT WHAT WAS IT LIKE WATCHING THE PLAINES TAKING GOING OVER YOU AND STUFF DID YOU SEE MUCH ACTIVITY IN THE AIR WE WENT FORTUNATLY NEVER GOT ATTACK FROM THE AIR I DON THIN TEY THE GERMANS THOUGHT OUR LITTLE BOATS WERE WORTH WASTING A BOMON THEY WANTED HIM FOR THE CAPITAL CITIES OR THE AIR FIELDS WERE YOU INVOLVED IN DEDAATALL YES NOW A WEEK BEFORE DEDAY THE BASE WAS SHUT DOWN LIKE AN OYSTER NOBODY COULD GO OFF DUY NOW ONE WAS ALLOWED IN FOR SECURITY REASONS OBVIOUSLY YOU COULDN'T GET ANY POST YOU COULDN'T MAKE ANY PHONE CALLS BECAUSE IT WAS COMING UP ALTHOUGH OFFICIALLY WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS BEFORE DI DEY ON ABLETO INSTRUCTIONS T BRIGE STARTED NIGHT SWEEPING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DAY SHIFT SO THE GERMANS WOURD GETTN USED TO THE IDEA OF AS POPPING ALONG THE COAST DURING THE HOURS OF DARKNESS THEY WOULDN'T THINK ANY OF IT SO THE EARLY MORNING OF D DAY WE WENT OUT AT MIDNIGHT AND WE WERE SWEEPING RIGHT UP TO THE LINE WHERE THE BATTLESHIPS WERE WAITING TO BOMBARD THE COAST WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE STATIONED AND WE SWEPT THAT MOST CAREFULLY AND THEN WE AS THEY STARTED COMING UP OUT OF THE DARKNESS FROM TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WAITING AND WE RETIRED BEHIND THEM THERE WASN'T ANTHING ELSE FOR US TO DO WE GOT SENT BACK HERE TO THE ISLE OF SHEVY WHEN THE TROOPS WENT ASHORE WE WERE A BIT ANNOYED CAUSE WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING AND THEN AM ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE DAYS LATER E SKIPPER GOT THE ORDERS TO POTROL THE DUTCH COAST ON THE SHELT AND PICK UP ALL THE MINES WHICH THE GERMANS HAD SOWN LIBERALLY ROUND ALL THE COAST THERE SO THAT KEPT US BUSY FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS AND A WE WERE STATIONED AT A LITTLE TOWN CALLED TERNUZEN A VERY SMALL PORT BUT THERE WAS A ALONG JETTY SO WE COULD MOORE ALONGSIDE THERE AND IN THE EVENINGS LATE AFTERNOON YOU GOT SHORE LEAVE UNTIL YOU WERE GOING OFF AGAIN NEXT MORNING AND I'D NEVER FORGOTTEN THE THINGS WE SAW WE WENT ASHORE THE GERMANS HAD GOT OUT IN A HURRY AND THAT THEIR SIGNS WERE EVERYWHERE ON THAT HOTEL LOUNGED UT BED BEN AN OFFICER'S MESS AND THE SIGNS WERE STILL UP AND THEY BLEW SOME OF THE BRIDGES OVER THE CANALS AS THEY LEFT AND THE DUTCH FLOODED SOME OF THE DIKHES TO STOP THEIR HEAVY TRAFFIC GETTIN AWAY AND I REMEMBER ONCE WE WENT ASHORE WE ALL CARRIED THE NAVY RAINCOAT DRAPED OVER YOUR ARM FOLDED IN A CERTAIN WAY AND THE OFFICER WATCH KNEW VERY WELL WE HAD THINGS IN THER POCKETS CIGARETTES PACKET OF BISCUITS A TILLER JAM OR WHATEVER WHICH WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN OFF THE SHIP AND WE WERE GIVING IT TO THE DUTCH CAVILIANS CAUSE THEY WERE AS STARVED AS HELL AND LOOKED VERY ILL AND ON THIS OCCASION WE GOT ASHORE AND I SAW A VERY THIN AGG LOOKING WOMAN COMING UP THE STREET PUSHING HER BATTERD PRAM AND SHE GOT TWO LITTLE KIDS IN THERE ABOUT THREE OR A BIT LESS I SUPPOSE AND ONE BLANKET COVERED TEM AND I DOFF MYHATS GOOD DAY AND SHE GAVE ME A SMILE SHE COULDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH AND I COULDN'T SPEAK DUTCH BUT I TOOK OUT WHAT I HAD AND I PUT IT IN HER PRAM YOU SHOUD SEEN THE LOOK ON HER FACE SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS COME TWICE ITWAS WHAT THEY DIDN'T EAT THEY COULD ALWAYS TRADE FOR SOMETHING ELSE COLD AE GONE BACK WITH MORE BUT TEM IT WASN'T TO BE AFTER WE GOT RID OF MOST OF THE MINS OFF THE DUTCH COAST WE HAD A A A WEEK'S LEAVE DOU WELL OBVOSELY WE WEREN'T COMING BACK HERE FOR IT IT WOULD BE ON THE DUTCH COAST AND I HAD A ANOTHER FELLOW WE GOT ON TO THE MAIN ROAD WHICH WAS TO THE BRUSSELS ROAD LEADING INTO INTO BELGIUM AND THUMB LIFS FROM E ARMY LOYS WHICH ARE ALWAYS GOING UP AND DOWN AND WE GOT INTO EM ABOUT THREE THREE HOURS NO A BIT LESS INTO BROUGE WHICH IS ONE OF THAWAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITIES I'VE SEEN CH GOT A TWO CATHEDRALS AND THE OPERA HOUSE AND THE TOWN HALL ROUND TE FOUR SIDES OF THE MAIN SQUARE AND ONE OF THE HOTELS HAD BEEN TAKEN OVER AS A NAPPY FOR THE TROOPS BED AN BREAKFAST SO WE STAYED THERE AND WE ENJOYED OURSELVES THEN WHEN WE CAME BACK WE GOT ORDERED BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AND WE WERE STILL LOOKING FOR MINDS WHICH MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED DETECTION GOING UP AND DOWN BUT THERE WASN'T A MUCH URGENCY IN IT ANY MORE AND E I DID PUT IN APPLICATION TO SIT FOR LEADING STEWARD BUT BEFORE THAT COULD TAKE PLACE MY DISCHARGE PAPERS CAME THROUGH AND THAT WAS IN THE ER EARLY EARLY NINETEEN SIXFORTY NINETEEN FORTY SIX NINETY NINE AN FORTY SIX YEARS AFTER THE WAR YEAR BUT UNLIKE THE ARMY OR THE AIRFORTE WE GOT PLENTY OF NOTICE WHEN IT WAS COMING I KNOW PEOPLE IN THE AIRFORCE AND THEY WERE GIVEN THREE DAYS NOTICE THOU AN THEY WERE OUT BUT IN THE NAVY WE HAD TIME YOU TOLD YOU GOT TO BE DEMOBBED IN THREE MONTHS WEL THEY GIVES YOU TIME TO START LOOKING ROUND FOR A CIVILIAN JOB OR SOMEWHERE TO LIVE IF YOU'RE MARRIED WITH KIDS SO I THINK WE HAD A BETTER DEAL CAN YOU EXPLAIN OYOU TALK ABOUT THIS MIND SWEEPING JUST EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WERE DOING AND IN WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MINES WELL TE LOOKED LIKE YARDS FROM THE MAIN MAST STRETCHED OUT EITHER SIDE ABOUT FIFTY FEET AND FROM THESE ARE DEPENDING VERY SHARP CUTTING WIRES WITH WEIHTS ON THE END AND AS YOU GO TO THE WATER THE IDEA IS TO YOUR CUTTING WIRES TO CATCH THE MORI WIRES FOR A MINE AND CUT IT THE MINE COMES TO THE SURFACE AND YOU DISPOSE OF IT HOW MANY MINES WOULD YOU FIND ON A AN AVERAGE DAY ON AVRE AAM POSSIBLY A DOZEN POSSIBLY ONLY TWO IT VARIED AND THE DISPOSAL WOULD BE A SHOT WIT IL THAT'S WHAT IT STAREE WI TIS THEN THE GERMANS EVENTLY AM ACCUSTIC MINE WHICH AM WASN'T MOD I WAS JUST DROPPED IN THE CHANNEL HOPEFULLY IN THE PATH OF ONCOMING SHIPS AND IT EMITTED A MAGNETIC FIELD FROM AM BATTERIES THAT WERE INSIDE AND EVERY SHIP AS IT GOES ALSO MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD AND WHEN THE TWO COLLIDE THE MUN GOES UP SO WE HAD TO HAVE WHAT WAS CALLED DEGAUSING EQUIPMENT A SPECIAL COIL FITTED RIGHT ROUND THE SHIP AND THE CURRENT IS PASSED THROUGH THAT ANTICLOCKWISE AND THAT NULLIFIES THE EFFECT OF THE ELECTRONIC FIELD AND YOU COULD GO OVER MINES AND YOU'D BE ALL RIGHT COULD YOU FIND THOSE MINES WE FOUND IM YES OU SOMETIMES THE GERMANS GOT CRAFFTED AND THEY DROPPED SOME OF THESE MINES THAT NIGHT FROM LOW FLYING PLAINS AND WE GOT BACK I WASN'T THAT I WAS ON A COUPLE O DAYS LEAVE AND I WENT HOME TO MAIDSTONE BUT EM I WAS TOLD AS OUR SQUADRON CAME BACK FROM PATROL AND THE LAST SHIP IN SLID INTO ITS PLACE ON THE JETTY AND PROMPTLY BLEW UP BECAUSE THERE WAS A MINE UNDERN EACH BEING DROPPED BY A PLANE AND THE SKIPPER OF THIS LAST BOAT AS HE WAS ONLY SIX FEET FROM THE JETTY HE GOT HIS DEGAUSY EQUIPMENT SWITCHED OFF I THINK THERE WAS TWO SURVIVORS BUT WHO THEY WERE I DON'T KNOW BUT HOW WOULD YOU FIND I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD FIND A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING IN THE WATER YOU CUT IT AND IT FLOATS ESO HOW DID YOU FIND THESE MAGNETIC MINES WERE THEY ON THE BOTTOM OR THEY'RE ON ON THE BOTTOM YES HOW WOULD YOU FIND THAT WELL WITH A LIKE A SONARD DEVICE IT PICKS UP THE HE RADIATIONS FROM THE MINE AND YOU CAL SEE EXACTLY WHERE IT IS THEY CAN DROP A DEB CHARGE ON IT YOU SET THE DEB CHARGE FOR TWENTY FEET OR THIRTY WHATEVER IT IS AND JUST TEM POTE THEM OVERS ASIDE ON A WY GUN IN HOLLAND WHEN YOU GOT TO HOLLAND YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMORIES OF JUST A DEVASTATION WHEN THE GERMANS GOT OUT IN HURRY THEY TOOK EVERYONE WITH THEM ALIVE OR DEAD AND BLEW A COUPLE OF BRIDGES AND THEN RETREATED TOWARD BELGIUM DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE WINNING THE WAR AT THAT STAGE YES THE GREAT DAY HAD COME THE INVASION HAD STARTED AND WE WERE PUSHING IN LAND FROM THE BEACHES WE HADN'T BEEN SHOVED BACK OFF AGAIN AND E WERE STARTING TO TO TO BITE WHEN YOU WERE PULLED OUT OF DEDAY DID YOU WERE YOU WERE YOU ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WAS GOING ON ON DEDAY AFTER THE BATTLE SHIPS HAV ARRIVED YOU'VE COME BACK TO BAIS DO KNOW WERE YOU AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR THE BUT THE GUNS GOING ON TTHE WHEN THE MAN BROADSIDE STARTED YES I THINK THAT WAS AQUARTER TO SIX AND EIGHT MILES OF SHIPS ALL OPENED UP AT THE SAME TIME AND WE ALREADY GOT INFORMATION FROM THE UNDERGROUND AND RESISTANCE WORKERS WHERE THE GERMAN STRONG POINTS WERE ALL ALONG THE CLIFF TOPS HEAVY GUN IMPLACEMENTS BUNKERS FOR TROOPS AND SO ON AND THEY GOT CONTINUOUS PLASTERING AND THEY HADN'T QUITE FINISHED IT WAS A TWO HOUR BOMBARDMENT AND BOUT HALF AN HOUR FOR IC STOPPED THE BOATS WERE GOING ASHORE WITH THE TROOPS DID YOU HEAR IT WE WERE ON THE MOMENT WE WAS BEHIND HEM WE HEARD IT ALL RIGHT IT WAS SUCH A DEAFENING CRUCENDO OF NOISE HERE'S NOT NOTHING LIKE IT WE WEREN'T EVEN NEAR IT NO WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER VEN EDAY OH THAT WAS AGAIN MARVELLOUS I WAS AWAITING THE MOB AND BECOUSE WE GOT RATHER MORE LEAVE ONCE PEACE WAS DECLARED AND I'D GOT EM I THINK IT WAS A FORDAY PASS TO GO HOME TO MADSTONE AND WE CAME UP ON THE TRAIN TO VICTORIA AND E THE PLACE WAR JUST ONE SEETHING MASS OF PEOPLE EVERY COLOR EVERY UNIFORM EVERY THING YOU COULD THINK OF EVERYONE WAS SINGING DANCING LAUGHING AND WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS ECAUSE THEYL LET THE HAIR DOWN AND IN FRONT OF BUCKIN AND PALACE YOU COULDN'A GOT A SHOE OWN IN THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS STRETCHING BACK DOWN THEM ALL WAITING FOR THE KING AND QUEEN AND WINSTON TO COME ON THE BALCONY AND THE ROAR THAT WENT UP MUST HAVE GONE ON FOR ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES NON STOP AY REFLECT ON YOUR NAVY SERVICE NOW I'M I'M GLAD I WENT MEANS I AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS DON'T HAVE TO READ ABOUT HISTORY WE WERE MAKING IT WE WERE PART OF THAT HISTORY AND I THINK ITS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF ARE THERE ANY OTHER STORIES YOU WANT TO SHARE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY KNOW AS I SAY IMINDSFEVEN AS A VERY DULL OCCUPATION WITH OCCASIONAL SHORT PERIODS OF ACTIVITY BUT AR UNLIKE DESTROYERS OR BATTLESHIPS YOU YOU'RE NOT ENENGAGED PERMANENTLY WITH WITH THE OPPOSITE NUMBER WERE THERE ANY OCCASIONS WHERE YOU WERE ENGAGED NO WE WERE NEVER ATTACKED BY PLANS AS I SAID AND E WE DIDN'T SEE ANY GERMAN TROOPS THE ONLY CONTACT WE HAD WAS WHEN THEIR LONG RANGE GUNS ON THE FRENCH COAST TRIED TO GET US WHILE WE WERE MIN SWEEPING BUT THE THEY DIDN'T
