by the time they'd gone into sicily which was that was the action we did on the romeo by the time that was well under way then really speaking it was a matter of form escorting and so the wolborough we didn't actually see much at all did it become a almost a bit too routine you were asdic operators were no you still watched if you were on watch you watched you didn't relax you did when the war finished you know we were bringing convoy down from gib down to alex and half way down and you'd see ships with lights on you know it was something that quiet and then the next convoy up we met the italian navy going towards alex complete italian navy was going into alex and we on a return trip as you were always short of water and food fuel and we couldn't get anything they were serving the italian navy was awful time to get what we wanted we weren't happy again did you stay together pretty much as a crew throughout your time on romeo and then wolborough and how many of the crew from romeo actually ended up on wolborough none so you were split all over the place we went into prometheus barracks and we fiddled about there i got fed up i don't like barracks all that much and there is one session they were asking for volunteers they didn't say what for and nobody i mean you don't do you you don't volunteer but then they said if we don't get any volunteers we're going to just pick and that would mean married men will go so that spurred us youngsters we volunteered i think about five ten eleven twelve i have a funny feeling there was about twelve of us and the first thing we went up into alex into a gents tailors and they said take what you want' and well you can imagine to our mines what have we done and then we went from there next day i think just basic kit khaki shirts with these civvie suits in our pack and got to haifa nobody knew what we were we were hungry we were tired we were given a tent nothing else just a tent and eventually they did come along with a bully beef sandwich and a mug of tea which is really good then of course we were tired we got down to it and nobody woke in the morning so we missed breakfast but they did once again came along with a bacon sandwich and a mug of tea and eventually we got down to the harbour and we went on an ml this was about evening time and luckily i managed to get hold of a bottle of brandy which sort of went around and we were deck cargo we were not down below we were on deck an this ml took us to famagusta cyprus truck over the mountains and actually we stopped at the top and there was a place on top where you could get brandy again and we couldn't understand why the driver wouldn't let us give him a drink but we did on the way to the other side you were looking straight down you know really way up and so we realised why he didn't want to take a drink sharp corners and it wasn't a road way it was a track we finished up the other side and near camp and we didn't mind anyway the indians killed this goat and we were given some of the meat we had to keep out of the way because our shadows mustn't fall on the goat or they couldn't eat it because it was tainted they gave us this meat we had one of these caldron things and some coal and a shovel and that was it apart from our own billy cans and cutlery and we sorted out this meat into the pot with the vegetables we had given us and then we had nothing to stir it with only the shovel all this hair floating on the top we were hungry i'll tell you that it got scraped off and then when it went in your billy can you scraped a bit more of but didn't we enjoy that stew oo we did really did you know it was beautiful you know anyway we went ashore one night there and there men came ashore and we were in the bar and somebody must of said something wrong because i have no idea what had happened a fight broke out have you seen on television fights where a chair is flung and it goes through the drum and things like that chairs flying bottles flying it was one of them that's the absolute truth what a fight i got away with it i was in the middle but i got away with it a lot of them finished up anyway the pickers were called and they separated us one on one so we're on another the other truck back to camp and they didn't even give us time for breakfast next morning in a truck and half of them hadn't washed disheveled you know with blood all over their face and we got on this destroyer once again as people were going past looked at us so where did you end up i don't know we were then transferred to a scooner it took us to one of the islands quite close to the coast and we were there to man these scooners five crew and a leading seaman you see but we never did we never did whoever sent us there changed their minds or maybe the war developed i don't know but we never did we stayed on this island even that wasn't good because there wasn't no cookhouse of food hall nowhere really you fend for yourself and scrounge what you could the wolborough was the best ship she was a wonderful ship to serve on and was that partly as a consequence of the other members of the crew the people you were serving yes the ship itself and the company you know the first lieutenant was a great chap and the skipper was wonderful and thing you remember most was the comradeship you know your mate was your mate and the royal navy patrol service did you feel that you were a very special little band of pirates oh yes yes and still do yeah yes yes we were the only branch of the navy who could wear that badge no other branch in the navy could wear that you know we're quite proud of it actually when i was in lowestoft when we were being demobbed i signed on to stay in but then just after that i got married and i signed off we had the choice you could do it and i seen so many dear john letters there was no way i was going to be married and in the service you can't blame the women you can't blame the men i mean a marriage is to be together isn't it so if you're away from home say three or four years things happen you hadn't or didn't it effect people i seen it you'll see it on the smaller ships so much more than on a big one and the personalities on that changed completely you know nice good humored easy going people and their nature changed completely it was quite sad
