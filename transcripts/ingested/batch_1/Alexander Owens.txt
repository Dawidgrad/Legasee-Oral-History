norman alexander owens that's my name i was on hms savage and my rating was able seaman as i finished i was ordinary seaman and able seaman and i was chatham barracks rating where do you hail from why did you want to join the navy i came from birkenhead originally and i joined the navy i don't know it just seemed the way things were at the time that people joined the different forces they fancied and i fancied the navy and so that was it where was that well i went to liverpool renshaw st i first went before i was eighteen and they wouldn't accept me so they said 'come back again' and i went back and i joined then and everything was alright then and i went down to hms ganges and we done all our training there it was very strict down there we used to have to go swimming early morning before breakfast we had to go and climb over the mast there was a great big mast there we climbed over it every morning before breakfast in our shorts and then we went to breakfast then and got whatever we could and then it was training all day then where is ganges in ipswich had you ever been out of birkenhead at that time no how was all that transition from being a boy to being a sailor i don't know really i think that we just accepted it going out of birkenhead was a big thing to me because nobody ever went travelled far in those days so to travel to ipswich and it took all day i think it was about nine o'clock in the morning to i think it was eleven o'clock at night when we got there because the train was putting into different stations and we tried to keep out of the way there was air raids going on sometimes during the travelling yeah we just accepted things i think in those days and got on with whatever you had to do when did you get to port division well you leave the ganges and then you go to they transfer you to various depots seaman's depots what we were in we went to chatham barracks then as a seaman what was chatham like oh they were very strict there oh that was a terrible place you couldn't walk across the parade ground at any time you had to walk around it to get to the other side you had to walk around if you walked across somebody'd shout to you and then you'd be on jankers then i can remember one time a petty officer was marching all the crew around the outside and he didn't salute this gunnery officer that was passing he should have said eyes left ' or 'right' or whatever it was and saluted him and he didn't and this gunnery officer stopped him and he said you'll report with your crew he said after four o'clock in the gymnasium and you'll be rigged out with they'll all have twenty eight lbs of sand on their backs and they'll be marching for two hours and that's what he done with us he had us running and marching for two hrs with twenty eight lbs of sand on our backs that was the punishment for that just for not saluting what was the barracks like as a place was it neat and tidy was it busy oh it was a tidy place yeah and if there was any air raids you had to go and sleep under tunnels which we did at times there was big tunnels dug in the side and we just used to go in there and sleep wherever you could i can't remember an awful lot about chatham barracks in a way how did you feel about being a chatham port division rating i suppose i was proud in one way to be included in it i suppose now we are but at the time it was difficult with all the disciplines we weren't used to that kind of discipline we were only used to household discipline type of thing how long were you at chatham before being given your ticket well i should have gone to this ship that we were going on and i was stopped because before i went in the navy i'd had erm pneumonia so when i went in they'd found this mark on my lungs and that held me back for a while so i was kept in i was at chatham barracks for a while until eventually i got this ship then and then i was sent up to newcastle on my own i had to find my way with a great big kit bag and a hammock i had to carry these on and off trains to get to newcastle and then i had to find my way to heburn dock yard which was further down again on the tyne and i found my way down there and it was an engineer officer in charge at the time there because i was one of the first ones to go and report and he said leave your stuff here he said and go find yourself a digs and then come back and take your stuff there i had to walk around and try and find digs while we were standing by the ship what they call victling' it's taking stores on and just generally tidying the ship getting ready for the main crew what did you think when you saw the savage i don't know really i suppose i was amazed at the size of it it wasn't very big but to me it was a big ship like you know i didn't realize just how big ships could get until i went on i just went aboard one of the big ships somewhere i think that was in russia and erm oh that's right we were going to look for bread in russia nd went on i can't remember the name of the ship but it was a cruiser we got lost on it trying to find our way to the galley on it because they promised to give us a couple of sacks of loaves which we couldn't get ours had all gone mouldy so you were basically one of the first people on this ship the savage i wouldn't say the first we i can't remember the name of what we were called we were like the first party to go waiting for the main party to come and we had to get all the stores on and get everywhere ready cleaned down ready for the crew to come and that was our main job really as just because at the time i was doing the butchering for them me and the petty officer i think he was called the victling officer that meant getting all the stores on and that was what our job was supplying and then i went being an ordinary seaman when the main crew came i was put with the main crew then just on ordinary jobs same as anybody else and what was it like setting sail for the first time can you remember that we went out and it wasn't very rough and i was sea sick then and that's a terrible thing that is to be sea sick for yourself i mean you couldn't care less what happened to the ship it was that bad then after about a fortnight i got over that then it was ok then you could stand anything after that because we did have some really bad gales on the way to russia can you remember the chronology what was the first thing you did the first tour the first operation on savage do you remember what as the first thing you did my first job was in a magazine then which you went down in the magazine and they'd batten the hatch down on you and you'd supply the gun with the ammunition then from there that was my first job and then after that i was also a searchlight manipulator and then i went on a four five gun on a turret gun it was and i was a loader on that and er you just accepted everything i suppose as things went did you know anything about the russian convoys at this time you'd hear little things but you don't imagine it's as bad as it is until you get there and then when we did finally did go on one we went to pick up some empties what they called empty ships' but they were full of wood i think as far as i know there was plenty of wood in russia then because there was loads of woods there trees and that i believe they used to cut those down to build the ships with them and we brought them back any adventures on that trip do you remember i don't remember much the only thing that i remember going in there it didn't look very nice from the start it looked a desolate place course there's a war on there and that had a lot to do with it did you ever get ashore did you go into murmansk no we didn't get to murmansk we went to poliana and erm archangel just little places we went to did you get to shore we got ashore there but you couldn't go far they wouldn't let you go far anyway you always had to be standing by the ship really in case of air raids because the german airfields weren't far away then in those days i think they said they were about twenty miles away then which wasn't far do you remember any air raids not really not a lot it was the u boats that was our main distraction' they were the worse things the u boats when you were doing the convoys you did twenty tell us a little about what it was like to sail in twenty four hour darkness twenty four hour sunshine and stuff we didn't seem to get much sunshine it always seemed to be dark to me whether that's just the way it was i don't know but if there was any sunshine i think it was caused by the northern lights which used to light the convoy up and that was a bit terrifying because the u boats could see us better then and that's when they used to do their attacking then when it as nice and light for them i suppose what was the role of savage within the convoy what was its job well our job was to go up and down the convoy trying to keep the u boats down and generally just escorting the ships one particular convoy we were escorting this merchant ship it was ss penelope barker it was called and we used to go along beside each day and shout instructions to it to get a move on because it was always lagging behind and they said they had somebody onboard who was ill so our doctor was shouting instructions across the tannoy asking questions what it was and he found out that he must have had appendicitis so he's shouting instructions what to do and then we carry on and eventually this ship got sunk and we went in to pick the survivors up and you throw scrambling nets over the side it's pretty dark but you had a little light on you red light and people'd go down the scrambling net to try and help them get in as quick as you can to get away and they're helping them all up as quick as they can and this one one fellow came up and said where's your sick bay and someone told him where it was i'm the one with appendicitis and he's been swimming from his ship to us and just casually i'm the one with appendicitis' and went on his way and then another one another survivor he got hold of the netting and he wouldn't let go of it but by then we'd picked up as many as we could and we had to go because we got a ping on the asdic to say there's a u boat about so we had to go and he wouldn't let go of this scrambling net and he started singing and of course the speed of us going and he's just swinging with it banging and singing and eventually he went and then we came back later on to try and pick more survivors up but we didn't find any but the cold's so severe you don't last long anyway were you actually involved in helping them as many as you can you always keep one side of the erm erm of the things and the other parties go and try and help to do what they can how long are you allowed to do this kind of rescue well you do it as quickly as you can actually the quicker you can get them on board the better because the quicker you can get away then because the u boats sometimes would hang about knowing that someone would come to pick them up and they'd sink the ship that's come to pick them up when this penelope is being hit did you see her go down was it an explosion it's just a big light and all on fire and she went down and the water's on fire because the oil's on fire and these men are trying to swim through it oh it's a terrible sight to see it it's still in my mind now and sometimes you get very upset when you think of it you know i suppose it was just a job and you just get on with it you're with all your mates and you're just trying to push it out of your mind and go on what was savage like was it a like a happy ship did you have a good time well it was quite a good ship i found and a good crew i never wanted to leave it i would be asked to go on a course but then if you went on a course you would leave the ship completely and i didn't want to leave it really but you don't know you're going to do all these convoys then you just go where the ship goes that's all you're doing is following the ship i guess one of the big moments in the savage's convoy experience was the sinking of the scharnhorst can you remember what you did personally on that day what happened was we were escorting the duke of york and a cruiser and we were told that the scharnhorst was coming out we'd had reports to say off the norwegian coast that she was coming out and she did come out then and when you say we were told' was your captain telling you this yeah we get reports of what's happening he said the scharnhorst is out with four destroyers and we're on the look out for her the scharnhorst is attacking the convoy but the crews with the convoy are keeping the scharnhorst away from them and they're reporting to the duke of york who's in charge of the whole operation of what's happening and eventually we're coming up to attack the scharnhorst then but she's getting away from the escorts of the convoy and she's getting away from them and so we're trying to pull her into a trap where the duke of york would be able to fire on it which did happen eventually and the duke of york sent us to tea early because she said we'd be approaching the scharnhorst at a certain time i think it was six o'clock i'm not sure or eighteen hundred hours like as they say then so we had our tea and then we went to action stations then and we stopped at action stations until the duke of york got the scharnhorst on the radar and she fired the firsts salvo then at the scharnhorst and i didn't know whether she hit it at first or whether she straddled it and then the scharnhorst started firing back and my mate on the range finder said have a look at this' so i looked through and i could see the scharnhorst but there was star shell above it which was lighting it up and so then the duke of york said she's getting away from us' so she sent the four destroyers which was us and the stored and the stormrays and the scorpion and we went in to attack it then and two destroyers went down each side of her firing torpedoes at it and we fired our torpedoes and as we're going in to fire our torpedoes the scharnhorst is firing at us and you could hear the shrapnel on the gun turret and we went in and fired our torpedoes and we came out and as we were coming out we went to attack a destroyer which we thought was a german destroyer and it happened to be the stormrays which had been hit the scharnhorst had hit her with some fire and we went to attack it but then we realized what it was and we helped her to get back then into russia we escorted her back into russia then what's that noise you talk about you're in the turret and obviously you can't see anything except through the finders but you could hear the shell breaking above you could hear one of the after guns that was an open gun and they were firing and one of their crew had his helmet blown off which he didn't know at the time it just came off and after we'd finished and come out he went to look for his tin hat and there was a big hole in it something like that i think it was and i believe he kept that as a souvenir because the shrapnel must have gone through it and missed his head and just knocked helmet off and he was alright did you see the scharnhorst go down no i didn't see that by then it was all lit up it was all on fire and lit up and gone down and we came out i've got all the survivors names there weren't many were there no i can't remember how many i've got them there anyway what's the feeling on the ship like after such a big battle like that oh it was a big relief well i don't think we realized what we had done actually i think you think oh we've sunk a ship and that's it but it was a big thing and you just feel a big sense of relief that she's gone because they only had the tapit after that which was a menace to the convoys once the scharnhorst had gone of course we think there's destroyers about' but there weren't they'd gone back in what were you doing you talk about the view finder what was your role in all this what can you hear and whats being told to you as you're going in to fire your torpedoes they're telling you the range the range is coming down all the time three thousand yds two thousand five hundred two thousand yds or whatever it was i can't remember the exact words now it's coming over all the time and we'd stopped firing because we'd given our position away you know you just go in and fire our torpedoes i suppose the men in the torpedo firing parts were the worse because they were all in the open we were not so bad we were in turrets are you firing a gun or a torpedo we were firing the guns four five guns we had my job was to load it with cordite i'd put the cordite in and the next one to me he'd turn round and put the shell in and then we'd push the tray over and just fire it then what's the noise and the impact like then it was just all excitement to do when you're waiting to fire that is the worse part you're all tensed up and your nerves are going everything's going until you fire and its not too bad after that you just keep going is it loud no it's not too bad actually i suppose it was loud but we didn't realize me being deaf now i don't know that maybe to do with the guns have you got any particular memories of the cold the snow the ice one particular time i had two pairs of gloves on and we dashed to action stations and as we go to fire my hand got trapped because my hand was that cold and these gloves on and the pressure was pulling my glove off and i thought it was pulling my hand off because it was that cold and i as screaming my head offfrightened scared stiff anyway it pulled the glove off and i was all right then it just damaged my hand a bit but the cold was terrific up there you couldn't touch anything metal you always had to wear gloves really and the seas you can talk about seas all day but you can't you can't imagine what it's like to climb up a wave like that like you're going up a hill and you see all the convoy and you go down and you can't see a thing just like climbing up i don't know like mt everest i think oh they were terrible seas there the people that's been there will be able to tell you this i'm not exaggerating at all on that but the cold and the ice you had to go chipping ice every half hour everything that was movable had to be chipped and when the bow went down into the wave like that and the spray had come up and if you were on the bridge it hit you like a little piece of the spray would hit you like a little piece of ice that's how cold it was by the time it's left the sea come up on the bridge and hit you it's a piece of ice that's how cold it was and you go down into your mess deck to get a warm and we had a little one bar fire like that an electric fire that had to heat a big area and all the deck head was covered in ice and all along the sides were all wet with the damp all your clothes were always wet i don't know how we survived really how did you stay warm you didn't take your clothes off when you come off watch you just flopped down on the deck in the water anywhere if there was a table free you lay down on the table or the long stools you lay on them some people said they used to sling hammocks but we didn't becausehammocks really then were made for shoring up holes if you were holed the hammocks were a help because the way they were strung the way you tied your hammock up that was the reason for it really was to plug a hole in the ship's side and the cold though i just can't get over it now how we survived it were the heads warm you'd get washed off those if you weren't careful you had to hang on you'd get washed through the because there wasn't much stopping you it was all open all your toilets were all open then in the after deck so in big seas you had to be very careful yeah the water would come over the toilet and wash you off i suppose it was the first jacuzzi bidet bidet you talk about being washed off did any of your crew mates ever get washed off yeah there's one there actually he was washed overboard there was two two of them washed overboard they tried to make a dash for it from the after end forward their duty was up on the bridge they made a dash for it but they got washed under the guard rail and one of them hung on to the guard rail and the other one went he managed to get up and get up onto the bridge and shout man overboard' but by the time we'd turned around it was pitch dark anyway by the time we'd turned around and went back there's no sign of him so that's his memorial card over there how does that affect the ship oh it does affect you it sets you back a bit everyone's a bit down for a while was he a mate of yours not a mate i knew him like but not an actual mate what was your skipper like oh we had a good skipper well we had a few skippers but this one during the scharnhorst battle he was very good some of them was what's the word for it now knowing what crew needs whereas some of them would be in pre war days still in discipline you know the discipline was very strict on some ships we weren't too bad at sea we could wear anything which you did you wore any old clothes at sea as you can tell from some of the photographs i've got at sea actually our main thing was a boilersuit that seemed to keep you warm because you were wrapped up in it the first trip i made though we didn't have any warm clothing i just had my ordinary dress coat which we used to go ashore with that's all i wore until i got a duffle coat then which we used to pass around as you come off watch you swapped it with someone else to go on watch with and then eventually we got duffel coats then when you're doing these legs obviously your sailing into russia then you've got to do the return leg did you have a preference going east or west erm not really no we just didn't think much about it at the time you just done what came your way type of thing we just brought empties back sometimes we didn't bring any empties back we just dashed back again and picked another convoy up because sometimes they used to run three convoys all the escort would be with the first one and get that into russia and then they'd all come out and meet the second one which was already on its way and then get that in and that's how we done it one after the other that was near the end of the convoys did you ever see any u boats sink a u boat no we didn't see any we'd go in to attack u boat many a time we'd attack them which we thought were u boats drop depth charges no we didn't see any but one of the trips we done was two destroyers like us and another one went dropping depth charges every so often we dropped depth charges and the convoy turned off so the u boat followed our depth charge noise for so long we done this for so many hours and then we we had the speed so we had to dash away then and catch up with the convoy hoping the u boats had followed us away and that was one one good thing we done i suppose what about stukka bombers we weren't too bad really we always had the the aircraft used to fly round us giving they used to give out signals to the u boats as to where we were they were signaling all the time to them and they were signaling the convoy and we couldn't do much about it until one time we had a carrier with us and they sent all the planes off and as soon as they see the planes coming off they'd go up into the clouds and go away and all the aircraft then come and land back on the aircraft carrier except two and they kept out of the way then as soon as this german plane came back in they attacked him and shot him down so that was one good did you watch it you can't really see much it's too dark even in the daylight its dark there how did you find that sort of twenty four hr darkness funnily enough we used to keep to the time as well can't remember what you call it now when you go over the time you'd have to put if the time is going ahead one hour we'd have to do half hour on extra and the other crew would do half hour coming on so that's how we used to catch our hour up by doing extra time on the watch we didn't think much about it really the time limit we just seemed to accept things i think we were disciplined that much in those days you just carried on did you find that towards the end of the war the convoys got easier oh yeah they definitely got easier the first convoys to go must have been really bad especially that pq seventeeen one jeremy clarkson was telling me about that i just met him at that do' there he was telling me about what he'd done so you didn't do any of the pq's then no no the jws and ras we didn't know what they were called then they were just convoys to us the morrassa she got sunk a destroyer with us we picked up some survivors up off that one the hardy was another one she got sunk we didn't pick survivors up off her somebody else done that the lapwing we picked survivors up off that one and she got sunk did you remember any of these people were you involved in some of this work not really no we'd be at action stations and other people would be doing that end of films
