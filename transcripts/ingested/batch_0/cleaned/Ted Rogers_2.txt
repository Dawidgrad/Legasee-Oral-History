what was your first ship and what was it like setting sail from liverpool was it from liverpool yes i sailed on the alfred jones this was my first trip from liverpool in may nineteen forty one and we went out into the irish sea and then we went round the north part of ireland to keep away from france and so on when the germans occupied it and out into the atlantic and then the convoy broke up mid atlantic and then we went individually then and we went to west africa what was it like setting sail for that first time do you remember it well you know you get a bit sea sick on your first voyage understandable there were four cadets there was always four cadets and some of them were second or third year you see so they helped you to realise what was going on and then you had a special cabin for the cadets or midshipman the two different names the same people and we eat with the officers we were classified as officers and the food was very good actually and we had passengers on the ship too and so you would be with the passengers there weren't many passengers but there were passengers there so it was much better than eating in england war time england and it was quite hard work though you had to do sort of four hours on and four hours off and during the war in danger zones you had what they called double watches and you had to spend hardly any time to sleep the most time you got was four hours and by the time you got into bed and had a sleep and woken up again you got about three hours sleep you know that was on what they called double watches normally it was four hours on and eight hours off but during the war in these areas which was difficult then it was to get more people on deck for look outs and manning the guns it was four off and four on you see tell me about the outfit what was it like as a ship the size your mess et cetera well we had on that ship we had about seventy people as we were commodore's ship as well and we had the commodore a retired vice admiral and his staff and then we had twelve passengers and then we had our own crew and in those days the crews were much bigger than they are today and because the ship didn't have such a quick turnaround you had to do a lot of work on the ship painting and so on you know and so i quite enjoyed it in a way and once you got into the tropics it was beautiful you had a calm sea beautiful nights you know the stars and so on and the dolphins jumping up and down ahead of the bows that was very beautiful why did the outfit the convoy split then well the ships went to different places you see the whole convoy couldn't go to one place because some ships were going to america some were going to south america some were going to the mediterranean some to south africa some to west africa the idea was to take the ships through the most difficult part of the voyage where there were german submarines and also german aircraft that could sort of reach them you see and that was why we went out straight out into the atlantic to get out of the range of the german bombers before we split up but then later on the submarines adapted a different tactic instead of lone submarines and lone ships you know that looked for they had convoys attacks convoys with wolf packs i remember one particular convoy we were in we got a message from we were commodore's ship again we got a message from the atlanta expect attack developing from ahead by twelve submarines in fact there were more we could see them during the day they were cruising along at the stern of the convoy on the surface and then at night they'd come on the surface again and would have a better speed than most of the escorts that we had corvettes couldn't keep up with them they'd come round ahead go down torpedo the leading ships go down through the lines and out the stern although we had an anti submarine gun we couldn't really fire at them there because you might hit another ship on the other side you see so they were very clever in their tactics so that was very difficult sometimes that would happen for days on end and it would only stop when you got air cover to spot them you know but when we were actually torpedoed that was a lone submarine by a submarine ace hessler and he was lurking around west africa to get the ships out of convoy because free town was an assembly point for convoys going up to england but the ships came in on their own and so they were waiting outside a hundred miles hundred and fifty miles outside for lone ships to blow up
