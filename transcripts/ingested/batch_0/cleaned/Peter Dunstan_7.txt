ok so finally on land anyway as a royal marine in singapore what do you remember now at this point getting a little bit rough the army were fighting a retreat down malaysia and the retreat was such that they got of the causeway big causeway that joins malaysia to singapore and the argyll and sutherland highlanders were the last british troops across the causeway before it was blown blown they dynamited it within twenty four hours the japs were crossing the gap which was blown it was more or less like a little swimming pool but it was decided that the royal marines would join the argyll and sutherland highlanders who had been cut up very badly in malaya and we were ordered to join the argyll's and we fought in the final stages of singapore island with the argyll's and we became known which is one of the honours in the royal marines today are the plymouth argyll's all the royal marines came from plymouth argyll and sutherland highlanders so they couldn't rename them anything else and there was about equal number the royal marines and the argyll's so we were called the plymouth argyll's and it's down in history the battalion of the plymouth argyll's fighting in singapore and i mean you fire huge guns on a ship and you probably trained with some machine guns but what was it like when you started actually fighting all i can remember about that it was pouring down with bloody rain we were moved up with the argyll's up into the more or less jungle rubber plantation sorry not jungle rubber plantation in the north east corner of singapore island and i can remember sort of roughly recall staying under a palm tree pouring down with bloody rain and the next thing we knew was being shot at by the japs and retreating back and getting back finally into the argyll's barracks in singapore and told we had to surrender that was about it what was that like can you remember i can't really i can't really remember just the fact that oh well that's it were prisoners of war and what was it like when you came face to face with the japanese then and they started moving you about we didn't funny enough the japs ordered all prisoners of war oh before that when we got back to tysal park which was the argyll's headquarters in the fighting i got a mortar bomb splinter in my left hand the scars still there and i was sent down to singapore general hospital because in the tropics if you ever go in the tropics and you cut yourself that will turn poison within hours and of course with that on my knuckle it blew up and i was sent down to singapore general hospital and that was more or less were i was well taken prisoner the japanese i didn't see many japanese any japanese at all they come in and ordered everybody out of singapore general hospital because they wanted it for their own troops and i was moved with a number of other allied servicemen who were also there to a small school which was a first aid post and from there up into changi village which was were the japanese they cordoned off the northnortheast corner i think it is of singapore island it's now occupied by the singapore airport and we were moved up there and i joined the argyll's and the marines that were there and that part of it regimental doctor of course wanted some help and my pal who was a corporal on the repulse and myself and a argyll volunteered to act as orderlies for the doctor and so we had a special little place in one of the shops in singapore in changi village which was the medical room and we had we lived in the navy quarters in the back the three of us so we were separated a little bit but we did alright when did you move out of singapore when were you herded out i can't give you exact date but the nineteen thirty six fact is something i'm doing upstairs at the moment there was a scheme to connect the thai railway to the burmese railway and the japanese had got the plans for this in fact i found two of the plans that are in existence in the royal geographical society in london i'd been up there and traced them and in nineteen thirty six there were two british one american and one other attempt or idea to join the railway of thailand to burma and the japs got hold of these and this is why you got the river kwai railway today because they used one of the plans but they were shipping us prisoners up to build the thailand railway and six hundred of us crowded into cattle trucks for about three day journey from singapore up to ban pong in thailand which was the village where really the whole thing started can you remember much about what that journey was like and what were your feelings at this point well you had no feelings you just accepted what was carrying on the journey itself was pretty horrendous because with twenty thirty i can't remember now exactly men crowded into an ordinary goods truck not the big long ones short ones and you used to take turns to sit by the door you organised it and sit by the door and on the way i can't remember how many stops there were and the japanese gave you rice and vegetable soup the rice was what you see as rice is polished rice but you get a lot of broken rice pieces of rice which are broken during the process and course that is virtually fed to cattle in malaysia and thailand and that and of course that being virtually free japanese fed that to us fortunately unpolished rice has a certain amount of vitamin in it and it did help us quite a bit but we were pretty well starving by the time we got towards ban pong
