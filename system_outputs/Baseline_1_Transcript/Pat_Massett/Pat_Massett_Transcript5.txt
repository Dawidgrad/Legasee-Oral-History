so do you remember that do you remember the sort of the beginning of june and the asculation in the amount of boats you must have seen a huge number of craft coming in near you walter there were a craft coming and going it with more lads so coming and going more than anything else that wasn't really until we did have the hospital ships in for a couple of days and we thought right that something was going on but we never knew the actual date and then as tom went home we were told it was more less on a han and we were more less told the non of the days and then all of a sudden we did hear thought it had been delayed for twenty four hours but there was nothing rely there wasn't a great build up of ships not actually in case only the usual ships the usual moorings and everything the ships that were usually there and i think there were well more as everywhere else until the d day started and then we saw the ships go out the whole of the day the whole day the ships were going out and it was it was our local padre as well as the padres and they went out with some of the ships as well so it was it was it was sad it was sad in one way because nobody knew how it would end nobody knew how it would end and every ship that went out that had were able to send us messages and there was anybody on board were you sent messages to everybody good bye and good luck hope to see you soon you know it was very sort of you know poignant it was it was sad in one way very it was funny feelings it was or odd feelings yes and how many you mean how many buts are you thinking you're sitting here the work there were other must have been thousands and thousands of boats because they are all different sizes all different sizes small boats big boats we never had any aircraft carriers or anything like that but there were destroyers and and all sorts of boats landing craft and lots and lots of landing craft lots of landing craft that it was mostly landing craft that went out the cars rows most ya did you see that could you see the man in the boat sato you could see the men were very close we were right there in the front very close to the wall sir it was very very close we were on the front right across the front you know that we were very very close and we would wait and and everything you know was it was i could you hear could you hear gunfire anything never hear gunfire we didn't hear any gunfire at all it was after everybody went out it was very odd because slip it i don't think there was a ship left in cos routes it was terrible everything was dead everything was dead that am you know everything was dead for about two or three days until the that a date hospital ships came back and that was awful we have about six hospital ships come into cars roads and more with all the wounded on board when can we the cap to bring send him messages when can we go up to southampton because they had the wounded on board so there must have been a big build up in southampton when you think of it they didn't realize that somebody wounded would go there they cut the just could not cope with it they couldn't cope with it and they were there may be three or four days before they could go up to southampton yes and that was that was very sad it was sad it was sad and after that it must have been about a month after that we were demobbed we were one of the first to get demobbed why so why did you not why wouldn't you just have posted somewhere else well because that we were taken on and we were moor less if i'd still been a messenger yes i probably would have been kept on but because that was just that was used that station was used just completely for d day then our job was finished and just it was this at all finished and we just when we just had our discharge papers whither i could have stayed on i don't know but we were discharged then and the boat's crew they were discharged at the same time probably some people were kept on but we were told we never had we weren't even asked if we wanted to stay on at the time well i never thought of it stayed on to me the put the that that the war was coming to an end and i joined up for the war and that was it as far as i was concerned that's what i wanted to do do my bit oh yes that was an that that what that was about i think that was about three o'clock in the morning and the detroit destroyers came along and i sent a signal we used to send two as in morse to say who are you sort of that men who are you two as in morse who are you and it came back to say it was a mess offer and that that's what he was on board a mess offer so i said we welcome at a safe and give my love to and i gave his name and number that tom and and that was that was really something and i was hoping to see him the next day but i never saw him but that that was really something special you now to see him archly go through cos an yes
