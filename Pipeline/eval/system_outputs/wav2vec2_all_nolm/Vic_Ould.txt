ALL YOU DO IS WALK ABOUT THE BARRACKS HAVE JOBS LIKE PAINTING COAL WHITE OR SWEEPAND UP OL ALL DIFFERENT PLACES AND YOU GO DOWN EVERY EVENING IN YOUR OWN TIME TO WHAT I BELIEVE WAS CALLED THE OLD BAR BIG BARN AND THER HAVE LISTS OF URM PEOPLE TO GO ON DRAFT EM FOR A SHIP WELL THE FIRST ONE I CAME ACROSS OFROF GOING DOWN THERE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS I HAD MY NAME ON THERE WAS QUITE A LOT ON THIS DRAFT SO WE HAD TO GO FOR SOME REASON TO HAVE A MEDICAL EVERYBODY HAD TO PASS THROUGH A MEDICAL THAT WAS ON THAT DRAFT WHERE IT WAS WHAT IT WAS FOR THEY'L NEVER TELL YOU THEY NEVER TELL YOU INTO THE NAVY IT'S KNOWN AS THE SILENT SERVICE THEY NEVER TOLD ANYTHING SO ANYWAY E WENT THROUGH THIS MEDICAL EXAMINATION AS IT CAME TO MY TURN TO SEE THE MEDICAL OFFICER HE SAID OUT WHAT OUT SO I STAND OUT ON ONE SIDE I HAD T WAIT UNTIL SOME TIME CAME ACROSS AND I SAID WHAT'S WRONG I FEEL ALRIGHT HE SAID YOU'VE GOT GERMAN MEETLS WELL MY GOODNESS GERMAN MEZLS AND YOU'RE FIGHTING THE GERMANS SAID I'M NOT HAVING BEEN ANYWHERE NEAR GERMANY HE SAID DON'T BE FUNNY I DOUBT ERM I SPENT A FEW WEEKS IN SIGBAY I'VE GOT NO MEMORY AT ALL OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE I DON'T THINK ANYTHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED BUT IF YOU'RE GOING ON THE DRAFT AND E GON ON THE SHIP OBVIOUSLY TWO HUNDRED MEN UPWARD ON THE SHIP YOU COULD PASS IT ON SO FEW WEEKS TIME SO MY NAME WAS AMANOTHER DRAFT AND THIS WAS FOR HMMSCARAN AND RM WE 'RE NOT TOLD WE JUST EM TOLD WEERE GOING ON A DRAFT AND YOU HAVIG A NUMBER OF OF DRAFT SO WHEN THE TIME CAME THERE WAS ABOUT O HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED OF US ERM FROM CHATHAM WE WERE PUT ON ER NAVY TRUCKS OPEN BACK HE TRAV WELL OVER BACK U OPEN BACKAT COVEARD TRUCK TAKEN DOWN TO THE LONDON TATION I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IT WAS NOW BUT ALL OF US P ON ER ONE TRAIN I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY OTHER CUSANY OTHER PEOPLE ON THAT TRAIN EVERYONE UNDER THE DOORS WERE LOCKED WE WERE LOCKED IN AND YOUNG LAD BY THE SIDE OF ME SAID NO WAT THAT'S FOR I SAD YEAH STOP US GETTING OUT NAVISH NIGHT STOPPE THE GIRLS GETTING TO US WHEN YOU GET TO A STATION THAT STARTED THE CHAT WE GOT FRIENDLY NONE OF US EVER KNEW EACH OTHER W WECOME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE ANYWAY THAT WAS A LONG TRIP UP TO GLASGOW GLASGOW W STOPPED QUITE A FEW TIMES EM I THINK FOR AIR RAG AND FOR NO REASON I BELIEVE WE STOPPED AT CARLYSLE AND M THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED A THE CARRIAGES LOVELY CUPS OF TEA AND SANDWICHES PASSED ACROSS FROM THE WV S OR WHOEVER NOW ANYWAY AFTER A LITTLE REST ON STARTED THE TRAIN AGAIN AS WE DREW OUT THE STATION I REMEMBERD THERE WAS BIG FACTORY BY THE SIDE OF THE STATION RIGHT ON A TRACK I AN OLD MILL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND OUT OF THESE WINDOWS THERE WAS BALLOONS AND GIRLS WAVING THE BALLOONS WERE NOT SOME OF THE BALLOONS I CAN REMEMBER I THINK THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OF ANOTHER TYPE WHICH I WON'T MENTION EM BUT ANYWAY THAT WAS NICE WE LOVED THAT THE FACT OF ER BEING YOU KNOW CHEERED ON OUR WAY WE EVENTUALLY ARRIVED IN IN GLASGO AND THE TRAIN CHANGED STRAIGHT AWAY OVER TO MUST HAVE BEEN A LOCAL TRAIN THAT TRAIN TOOK US TO GREENOCK E GREENOUTH WAS OUR DESTINATION AND WE WERE THEN PUT INTO ERM IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE YMC A A BIG BUILDING AND WE WERE THEN TOLD THAT WE WERE DUE TO ERM HAVE B SHIPS COMPANY OF A BRAND NEW SHIP BEING BUILT IN THE SHIPYARD WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO WIAMIS HAVORITWYMA REALLY NOW IT WASN'T READY UM WE COULD GO AND LOOK OVER THE SHIP ER ANY TIME WE LIKED A MASS OF WIRES AN ERM PEOPLE WELLED IN ERM AND E II CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT WE DID WE MUST HAVE WALKED ABOUT GREENOK ER ANYWAY IN A FEW WEEKS THE SHIP WAS READY ALL THE OLD WIRES AND BITS AND PIECES HAD BEEN REMOVED AND WE WERE SH GIVEN OUR PLACES I WAS ON THE FOREHEAD MESS DECK WE WERE POINTED OUT WHERE WE EHAD OUR LOCKER WHERE WE P NEW CLOTHES WERE IN UNIFORM NOW OF COURSE ALL OUR CIVILIAN CLOTHES HAD GONE SO WE JUST HAD OAL NAVAL CLOTHES THE FIRST THINGS WE HAD TO DO GO THROUGH IALS THE TRIALS WERE TAKEN UP THE CLYDE YOU HAD TO DO THIS SPEED WHATEVER DETERMINED AND EA FEW GUNNERY TIRTRIALED ANYWAY WHEN WHEN WE FINISHED THE TRIALS AND THE SHIP WAS COMMISSIONED THEN INTO THE ROYAL NAVY AND THAT WAS HE TIME WE WERE GOING TO BE OFF NONE OF US WAD EVER WAS TOLD THA WE WERE GOING O GO ON A CERTAIN DAY SO IF WE HAPPENED TO BE HAVING SHORE LEAVE WE COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY BUT THEN ONE DARK NIGHT SHORTLY AFTER WE FINISHED OUR TRIALS WE SLIPPED FROM THE DOCK DOCKSIDE THE URM OF THE ERM THE YARD THE OTHER YARD AND M EDGED OUR WAY UP THROUGH THE CLYDE NO LIGHTS OF COURSE WE CLOSED ALL THE WATER TYHP DOORS ALL THE SCUTTLES ALL THE DEAD LIGHTS AND WE WERE GIVEN OUR POSITIONS THAT WE WE'RE ON WATCH THEN WE WERE REAL SAILORS THEN SO I WAS STARBOARD WATCH SO THEREFORE I WOULD OV BE UP ON THE ER HALF AN HOUR FF ON THE SARBOARD LOOKOUT WE WE NEVER HAD ANY ACTUAL TRAINING FOR THIS IF WE JUST WER TOLD TO DO WAT WO WERE TOLD SO ANYWAY WE EISED OUT OF THE CLYDE YOU HAVE TO GO PAST THE BOOM WHICH LET YOU OUT O THE TIDE CLIDE AND I REMEMBER I CAME OFF WATCH OR I HADN'T GONE ON WATCH I CAN'T REMEMBER AT THI STAGE BUT I'D HAD REASON TO GO TO THE HEDE WHICH I THE TOILETS I SIT DOWN JUST SITTING DOWN AND EREAS AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION BANG A ORS RATTLED PULLED MY TROUSERD UP QUICKLY RUSHED OUT OF THE DOOR INTO THE EM WHAT THEY CALLED THE RM CANTEEN FLAT THAT'S JUST ERM PASSAGE WAY AND BUMPED INTO EM ONE OF THE OTHER SAILORS WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERIENCE THAN ME I SAID AVE YOU BEEN TORPEDOED AN OUR FIRST NIGHT OUT NO IT'S ONLY THE TORPEDO AND TRYAND TO DEPTH JARDIT OUT BUT SHAME FACED I DIDN'T GO BACK HE SAID WELL YOU WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE THERE OR ANYWAY SO WE HAD A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT THAT ANYWAY FROM THERE UM AS I SAY IT WAS A DARK NIGHT WHY WAS IT ALL ERM SO CLANDESTINE WHEN YOU LEFT WELL THITHIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THE ENEMY ERM KNEW THAT THERE WAS SHIPS BEING BUILT NEARLY ALL THE TIME AND THEY WOULD COME OUT OF RM THE CLYDE OR COME OUT OF THE TINE OR C PERHAPS COME OUT OF RMER IRELAND AND IF IF YOU CAN VISUALIZE IRELAND AND SCOTLAND AND THERES IT NARROWS IT'S REALLY WIDE NIT'S A LONG DISTANCE BUT IT NARROWS AS AS A CONTINENT AND THEREFORE SHIPS HAD TO COME IN AND OUT OF THAT AREA WELL THIS WAS ALWAYS THE PLACE WHERE YOU'D HAVE TWO OR THREE U BOATS JUST LURKING HOPING FOR A GOOD KILL AND WHETHER THEY WERE EVER FOUND OUT THAT A SHIP FROM ANY SPYES OR ANYTHING WAS COMING OUT AT THAT TIME IWAV NO IDEA BUT THAT WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS PARTPIRAT NONE OF US HAD WORKED TOGETHER WE'D ALL COME OUT OF TRAINING WE'D HAD GOOD TRAINING IN OUR OWN JOBS BUT OF COURSE NOT A DERTALN BECAUSE WE WERE NOT WITH THE SAME PEOPLE WE WERE TRAINING WITH SO FROM THERE ONWARDS YOU WERE UPFORD HEBIDAS IT WAS REALLY ERM THE THE FEW SAILORS THATEXPERIENCED AND THE OFFICERS OF COURSE WHOU WERE EXPERIENCED THE OUTH HAD TO HAVE ALL THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO DO WHAT YOU WERE DOING BECAUSE YOU'D GET NO ESCORT YOUR SHIP COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN WITH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CREW THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TO SEA BEFORE NEVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP BEFORE VERY OFTEN SO IF WE'D BEEN ATTACKED AT THAT TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SETTING DUCK WHEN WE ARRIVED AT SCAPAFLOW WHICH IS RELATIVELY SAFE WE ERM GO THROUGH THE BOOM AGAIN TO GET INTO THE FLOW AND FROM THEN ONWARD YOU DO OUR TRAINING THE TRAINING AT SCAPAFLOW REALLY IS TO GET YOU WORKING AS A TEAM THE WHOLE SHIP HAS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING A GUN CREW FOUR OR FIVE HAD TO KNOW HOW TO WORK TO GETHER A YOUERE IN THE M ER TRANSMITTING STATION WHICH IS THE ONE OF THE NERVE CENTRES LIKE WE WERE S GUNNERY CONTROL YOUWO'LD HAVE ERM ABOUT TEN PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM WIT AS ONLY INTHE SIZE OF AN ORDINARY N SITTING ROOM AND RMEACH ONE OF THOSE HAD A JOB TO DO BECAUSE ON A DESTROYER WHICH WE WERE MSCARO WAS A DESTROYER E A BRAND NEW RUN AS WELL SO NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT ERM SO WE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE FIRE CONTROL TABLE AS IT WAS WHERE YOU GOT EIGHT PEOPLE ON IT AND ALL THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THEY'D TRAINED ON SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THE TRAINING THEY STILL HAD TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT IF THE SHIPS ATTACKED OR IF WE SHD ATTACK ANOTHER SHIP SO THAT WAS WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF US IN THE FLOW THAT TIME WE WERE SO SHORT OF DESTROYERS IN PARTICULAR AND OTHER ESCORT SHIPS SO NOT ONLY WERE WE STAYING IN AN ICE SAFE AREA TO DO OUR TRAINING WE WERE SENT OUT EIN HARNESS AS IT WAS CALLED WITH ANOTHER SHIP TAT MIGHT BE MORE EXPERIENCE BUT THEN THE CA OF COURSE THERE'S ONLY ONE OF YOU THIT S EXPERIENCE AND ONE WHICH IS TRAINING WHICH HID US SO EM WE WE LEARNT IT THE HARDWAY ALL OUR REAL FIGHTING UM WAS AROUND THAT TIME ERM AT THE END OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH WAS ERM ER OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER E WAS AROUND THAT AREA SO THEYO'LD SEND US OUT WITH ANOTHER SHIP AND THIS IS IN ONE CASE WE WERE THE ONLY SHIPS THAT WERE IN THE FLOW DESTROYERS AND WE WERE OF COURSE DUTY DESTROYER AND HMS BULLON WHICH WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AT THAT TIME E WAS A SHIP THAT W GT SUNK SO WE WERE SENT OUT ER WITH NO N NO BASIC TRAINING ON THIS WE HAD A CALL TO GO TO A SHIP OFF CAPE ROT THAT HAD BEEN SUNK DIDN'T KNOW WEREIHAD BEN TORPEDOED TE DIDN'T ACTUALLY OUR MESSAGE WAS NOT THAT IT HAD BEEN SUNK THAT A SHIP HAD BEEN TORPEDOED AND TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO GO OUT TO TRY AND HELP TO CATCH THE U BOAT THAT HAD SUNK OUT AND TO PICK UP SURVIVORS IF THERE WERE ANY THERE SO THERE WAS TWO OF US AND IT SEEMED MFROM THE RECORDS I LOOKED UP THE OTHER SHIP THAT WENT OUT WITH US WAS ANOTHER SHIP THAT WAS ALSO WORKING OUT SO THIS TWO DESTROYERS WE ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL EM HAD TO GO OUT TO THI SHIP I FOUND OUT LATER IN LIFE IT WAS HMS BULLON WHICH WAS A ESCORT VESSEL AND THEY AD BEEN LOOKING FOR A U BOAT THE VERY U BOAT THEY'D BEEN LOOKING FOR HIT ONE OF OUR SHIPS FIRST SO HMS BULLEN HAD HAD BEEN SUNK AND ER THE OTHER SHIPS THAT WERE WITH US WERE STILL LOOKING FOR THETHE U BOAT WELL ERM THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS ERM OUR SKIPPER WAS VERY KNOWLEDGEIBLE VERY EXPERIENCED AND HE WENT TO THE POSITION WHERE TE UB WHERE THE U BOAT HAD SUNK HMS ERM BUTEGMS BULLEN NOBODY WAS TOLD ANYTHING HE KNEW IT AS GHMISSIBLE AND NONE OF US WERE TOLD SO THE FIRST THING YOU DO YOU GO ROUND CDEPTH CHARGE IN THE WHOLE OF THE AREA IN CASE THE U BOAT IS STILL THERE WELL WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH TOLD OUR ASDICA OPERATOR THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DOWN THERE WHICH COULD BE THE U BOAT SO WE DEPTH CHARGED THAT AREA AND APPARENTLY THE ERM ECHO WE GOT DIDN'T MOVE IT STAYED THERE SO WE ASSUMED THAT THAT WAS A U BOAT AND M ENEVER CAME UP NEVER GOT IN THE OIL NEVER GOT ANYTHING SO M AT THAT TIME OF THE WAR THE ERM SNORKE HAD ONLY JUST STARTED SO WHICH HELPED THEM LATER ON IN THE WAR NOW THIS U BOAT IF IT DIDN'T COME UP WITHIN TWELVE HOURS THEN IT WAS A DEAD DUCK SO WE WAITED AROUND THERE ALL NIGHT WITH A BOARDING PARTY READY TO GO ONTO THE U BOAT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME UP FWER IF IT HADN'T BEEN AND THEN IT SEEMED WE HAD TO GO ON ANOTHER JOB I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE UT WE HAD TO GO ON AN ESCORT JOB SO WE STOOD DOWN THE WHOLE TEAM I WAS LOOKING THIS IF THE NEXT MORNING WE STOOD DOWN THE ERM TEAM OF THE BOARDING PARTY AND I WAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE OF THE SHIP I HAD NO WORK TO DO I WAS OFF WATCH AND I COULD SEE IN A NEAR DISTANCE A MAGNETIC MINE FLOAT PAST BUT NOBODY SHOT AT IT WHICH THEY MIGHT AV DONEUSUALLY JUST IN CASE THERE WAS A NEW BOAT DOWN THER WOULD KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL THERE WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE ALL NIGHT YOU NEVER STARTED YOUR ENGINES BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT U BOAT IF YOU WER STILL ALIVE THER DOWN THERE TO KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL UP THERE WAITING SO IN THE END WE ERM WENT BACK TO CAPAFLO AND CARRIED ON WITH OUR RM LEARNING TO FIGHT A WAR TELL ME ABOUT CHRISTMAS IN SCAPAM WELL ERM THIS WAS THIS I TOLD YOU ABOUT WAS THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER OR THEN E SMALL JOBS WE MIGHT HAVE DONE THERE I'M NOT SURE BUT THE NEXT IMPORTANT THING I CAN REMEMBER IS TAT WE WERE ERM NOT REQUIRED FOR WORK AROUND THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD SO WE WERE BACK IN SCAPAFLOW AND IT WAS QUIET AND WE WERE SAFE BUT NONE OF US HAD HAD A CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME BEFORE THIS AND THERE WE ALL WERE IN A DEAD PLACE SCAPLO SCAPAFLOW WAS A TERRIBLE PLACE BETTES ANYTHING AND WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS THERE'S TWO HUNDRED ON THIS SHIP ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED SHIPS COMPLIMENT AND LUCKILY WE HAD A FEW AMONGST US THAT WER EXPERIENCED AND THERE WE WERE COOKS AN THE MESS WERE MAKING CHRISTMAS CAKES WIT WHATEVER STUFF WE COULD GET HOLD OF YOU ALSO MANAGED TO GET I'M NOT SURE WHERE FROM A CHRISTMAS TREE FOR SOMEWHERE AND THAT IS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE MAST ON THE TOP OF EVERY SHIP AT CHRISTMAS TIME IF THEY'RE IN HARBOUR THEY HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE WHICH AS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE SHIP AND RM WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED I THINK BY THE OFFICERS BEING CHRISTMAS BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER YOU WERE OR NOT AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE DRINK ON BOARD IT'S A DRY SHIP AT SOME OF THE OLD STAGES AHAD SAVED SOME OF THEIR RUM RATION WHICH YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO BECAUSE THE VERY BAD VERY HIGH CHARGE AF YOU WERE CAUGHT BUT THE OFFICERS NORMALLY ON A ON A SMALL SHIP LIKE A DESTROYER CLOSED THEIR EYES TO LOTS OF HE THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO IF THEY WERE ON A BIG SHIP THAT WE CALL A PUSSER SHIP SO MANY OF THE LADS THAT WERE ALLOWED O RUM I WASN'T BECAUSE YOUERE NOT ALLOWED TO RUM UNTIL YOUWERE TWENTY AND I WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN ERM BUT OUT CAME THE RUM RUSION HORRIBLE I HATE IT EM AND URM PEOPLE MADE UP THINGS OUT OF PAPER EM I THINK SOME E PACKAGEIN PAPER RED GREEN AND BLUE CAME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES OUT OF HIDY HOL AND MADE INTO DECORATIONS AND E WE WERE MORED AT A BOY THERE AF THE TIME AND W SINGING CHRISTMAS SONGS EM SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAD INSTRUMENTS ERWE HAD A SMALL BAND ON BOARD AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE I SUPPOSE CAMSOME OF OUR LADS WHO COME FROM HOMES THAT NEVER HAD IT BAD I THINK IT WAS VERY CHEERFUL FOR HEM E I CAME FROM ER A HOME THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY SO CHRISTMAS WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FOR ME SO ANYWAY WE ALL ENJOYED OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME AND EN A PLACE LIKE SKIPAFLOW SO THAT'S QUITE GOOD ERM COMMANDER WILKINSON E WAS OUR AR CAPTAIN AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A LIFE FOR HIM REALLY AFTER WE'D BEEN WITH HIM FOR A TIME BECAUSE ALTHOUGH HE WAS VERY STRICT ERM HE WAS QUITE HAPPY TO TURN HIS LE HE WAS ALAWD THE SAME WATH US EM LATER ON ER IN THE STORY WHEN WE GOT UT FA EST ERM I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT BUT HE WE HAD ERM MULTIPOLO TEAMS AND HE WAS ON THE TEAM WITH THE LADS AGAINST THE OFFICERS AND E THAT WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON HE WOULD BE AND E HE WAS I THINK BOXING CHAMPION OF ER OF THE FLEET OR PART OF THE FLEET AND E YE HE WAS SUCH A NICE PERSON YOU KNOW AND THERE IS ANOTHER CASE I'L TAKE IT TELL YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE WHEN I GO ASHORE SO ERM BUT THE NEXT THING WE WE WENT ON REALLY AFTER CHRISTMAS AFTER CHRISTMAS WAS WHEN WE REALLY STARTED URM LEARNING THAT THERE WAS A WAR ON WE WOULD STILL GO OUT AN WOU'D STILL GO OUT AS A SHIP WORKING UP TOGETHER BUT THE FIRST ONE EWHEN W WEN WE WENT OUT WITH I BELIEVE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND THIS WAS TO BE A STRIKE AGAINST NORWAY WE DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL WE WERE AT SEA WE WERE DOING THIS BUT THERE WAS THESE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS SOME MORE DESTROYERS I THINK AND RM SOME OTHER SHIPS NOW OUR AIR JOB WAS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT THE ERM ONE OF THE CARRIERS BUT IT WAS ALSO TO ACT AS ERM A LIFEBOAT REALLY WHEN THE ERM AIRCRAFT TOOK OFF AND I THINK A COUPLE OF THESE WERE ER OLD TYPE AIRCRAFT ERM I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF BUT THEY WERE BYPLANES NOW THIS WAS A REALLY ROUGH DAY AND THEY TOOK OFF I WATCHED THEM I WASN'T ON WATCH ALL THE TIME AND I WATCHED THEM FROM THE DECK AND THE CARRIER WAS BOLANCING UP AND DOWN BUT THEY TOOK OFF AND I THINK THEY CARRIED OUT OR TRIED TO CARRY OUT THEIR TASK BUT THE TWO ISOR COME BACK DIDN'T MAKE IT CAUSE THEY THE SHIP WAS DANCING UP AND DOWN THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER DANCING UP AND DOWN AND I BELIEVE ONE OF THEM HIT THE DECK WAS PUSHED OVERBOARD THAT'S WITH THE PEOPLE IN IT THEY CAN'T TAKE THEM OUT PUSHED THEM OVERBOARD TO MAKE WAY FOR ANOTHER ONE LANDING AND THE OTHER ONE DISAPPEARED I THINK HE WAS GIVEN ORDERS TO TRY AND FLY BACK TO HIS BASE OR A BASE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH TO LAND ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER WE I THINK ITD BEIN CRASH BOAT A WAS CALLED WE ERMWENT TO TRY AND FIND THE AIRCRAFT THAT HAD DITCHED SADLY NO AIRCRAFT SO ANYWAY I THINK THEY HAD TO CALL OFF TESTRIKE CAUSE IT WAS JUST TOO TOO DANGEROUS TO DO ANY MORE EM FLYING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO THAT WAS REALLY A BAD BEGINNING TO MY WAR ERWE WENT BACK TO SCARPA YOUTALK ABOUT IT BEING ROUGH HOW ERE YOUR SEA LEGS TERRIBLE I WAS SEASICK MOST TIMES I WENT TO SEA BUT E WHEN YOUR WHEN YOU'RE ON LOOKOUT OR WHEN YOU'RE IN THE TS WHICH IS IN CAMP THE TS IS DOWN BELOW M AND THAT IS THE TRANSMITTING STATION THAT TAKES THEA THAT'S LIKE A RELAY FROM THE DIRECTOR TOWER WHICH IS RIGHT UP THE TOP OF THE SHIP THROUGH YOU IN A TS TO THE MAIN ARMAMENT WHICH IS FOUR FOUR INCH GUNS SO ERM IWAS THE COMMUNICATION NUMBER SO THE DIRECTOR WOULD SPEAK TO ME THE OFFICER TWO OFFICERS IN THE DIRECTOR WOULD BE SPEAKING TO ME AND I WOULD BE SPEAKING TO THE GUNS BUT APART FROM THAT EM THE DIRECTOR WOULD HAD INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD ERM SEND SIGNALS DOWN TO OUR BIG COMPUTER THE ORIGINAL ERMMECHANICAL COMPUTER THE MECHANICAL COMPUTER WOULD SEND THAT INFORMATION MECHANICALLY TO THE GUNS ERM BUT ONCE I GOT INTO A POSITION WHERE THERE WAS EXCITEMENT I FORGOT ALL ABOUT SEA SICKNESS I WAS OK SO THAT WAS A GOOD THING BUT NORMALLY IF I WASN'T ERM ON ONE WATCH I SANDING I'D BE STANDING ON THE UPPER DECK WATCHING THE SEA HEAVING UP AND DOWN AND PROBABLY BEING SICK THE ONLY TIME YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS IS WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING ACTION YOU KNOW ERM LATER ON N I TALK ABOUT THE MINE LAYING WE WERE AT ACTION STATIONS ALL THE TIME BUT IF YOU'RE DOING A JOB JUST ESCORTING THEN YOU'RE AT CRUISING STATIONS AND UNTIL SOME TROUBLE POPS UP UM DEPTH CHARGING U BOATS IS NOT A CASE OUF GOING TO ACTION STATIONS IT'S ONLY IF THE E U BOAT FIGHTS BACK N THEN YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS SO ANYWAY ERM WE WENT FROM THERE BACK TO SCAPAFLOW ERM I THINK WE DID ONE OR TWO JOURNEYS LIKE THIS M OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND EVENTUALLY EM WE SUPPOSEDLY FINISHED OUR TRAINING OF WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM MIND YOU ALL THIS TIME I'M ER TALKING TO YOU ABOUT NOW WE WERE STILL LEARNING BECAUSE WE WERE STILL TEAMING UP WITH PEOPLE THAT WE NEVER WORKED WITH BEFORE SO IF WE'D RUN INTO ANY REAL TROUBLE AT THAT TIME WE WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD A LOT OF CHANCE IT WASN'T NTIL LATER ON WHEN WE HAD LEARNT THESE THINGS SO ERM THE NEXT ONE I THINK ERM IS AN IMPORTANT ONE THIS IS IN ABOUT FEBRUARY I BELIEVE WE WERE JUST TOLD WE WERE GOING OUT I THINK THAT NIGHT M WE WERE NOT GIVING ANY REAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE WE WERE GOING ON WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO BUT IT WAS A VERY BIG DO THERE WAS A VERY LARGE FORCE EM IT WAS WE LEFT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT I BELIEVE IS THIS OUT E FIR SCAPPER THIS IS OUT AF SCAPPER AND TH IS THIS IS WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE MINE LANE EM OPERATION ERM IT IT WAS A VERY IT WAS AVER ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO MOON IT WAS ALL STARLIGHT SO IT WAS VERY GOOD VISIBILITY AND IT WAS A VERY CALM NIGHT STRANGELY ENOUGH HARDLY ANY ROUGH SEA OR ANYTHING EM WE SET OUT AND OF COURSE YOU SELDOM KNOW WHO'S WITH YOU YOU IT'S HE SILENT SERVICE YOU'RE NOT TOLD ANYTHING AND WE'D BEEN ABOUT OUT ABOUT AN HOUR I BELIEVE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AND THE SKIPPER THEN SET OVER TO TUNOY WHAT WE WAS GOING TO DO ID OPENED HIS ORDERS ANDHE TOLD US THAT WE R WE WERE A BIG FORCE ONE OF THE LARGE FORCE WERE GOING ERDOWN THE SOUTHERN PART OF NORWAY TO EGASUND AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY WE WERE JUST ONE OF TWO SHIPS EM THE OTHER ONE WAS EZILIUS SAME SIDE OF THE SAME DESTROYER AS WE WERE AND OUR MAIN ERM TASK WWE HAD TO ESCORT THIS ERM MINE LAYER AMS OPOLLO ERM FIRST OF ALL BOTH FORCES WORKING TOGETHER HAD TO PASS THROUGH A BIG MNE FIELD THTHERE'S A BIG MINE FIELD THAT WAS LAID I THINK BY US ERM AND EM WE HAD TO GO THROUGH ONE PATH FOR IT WHICH WIS THE ONLY PASTH THROUGH IT BUT WE KNEW WHERE THE OPENING WAS SO IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE ENOUGH BUT YOU DO GET LOOSE MINES SO OUR ASDEC OPERATOR HAD TO ERM PICK OUT THE MINES THE MAN AND I WAS ON WATCH AT ONE TIME AND I COULD HEAR HEAR HIM SAYING ERM THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE PORT SIDE AND THE CAPTAIN WOULD MOVE THE SHIP OVER A BIT SO ANYWAY WE GOT THROUGH THE MINEFIELDALL OF US HAD NO REAL PROBLEM AND M THEN WE SPLIT UP WE WERE TO WAIT TIL TWELVE O'CLOCK AND AT THAT TIME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE OTHER BIG FORCE WE WE WERE BY THE WAY UP THERE TO DAVAA AT THAT POINT AND THE OTHER BIG FORCE WAS TWO CRUISERS I THINK AND AND NO AIRCRAFTS CARRIED AT THAT POINT AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY GERMAN CONVOY THAT WAS GOING TO LEAVE EGASUND AND WAS GOING INTO HUNGERD COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO ERM STEVANGA WHERE WE WERE WE ETHE OTHER FORCE WAS TO STOP THEM GETTING THERE SO DAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK THE ERM THE OTHER FORCE WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE CONVOY AND THEY WERE HOPING IN THAT SWHEN THAT STARTED THERE WOUD BE LOTS OF FIREWORKS DOWN FURTHER ALONG THE COAST IT WAS QUITE A FEW HUNDRED MILES BUT THAT WOULD TAKE THE HEAT OFF WHAT WE WERE DOING WE WERE A CLANDESTIN OPERATION THE WE WERE TO ESCORT THE APOLLO TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WERE GOING TO START LAYING MINES DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK AND WE WERE TO BE BETWEEN HER AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND IF IF SHE WAS SIGHTED ON BY THE GERMANS EM OR PICKED UP BY RADAR BY THE GERMANS AND THEY WERE TO START FIRING WE WERE TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS WE COULD AND TEAR UP AND DOWN THE BIT OF SEA BETWEEN US AND BETWEEN THE APOLLO AND THE M NORWEGIAN COAST AND USE ALL THE GUNS AND FLARES AND EVERYTHING YOU COULD TO TAKE THE HEAT OFF HER SO THAT 'D ATTACK US ERM SO THE APOLLO ERM WOULD HAVE EITHER FLUSHED US O INDICATED TO US OR NOT ON THE SHORE BECAUSE YOU COULD GIVE EVERYBODY HAD TO KEEP RADIO SILENCE AND RM ND WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO SMOKE SHOW ANYTHING YOU WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO THE BANG BECAUSE THE NOISE URM WE WERE NOT FAR AWAY FROM THE COAST HOW TO AND URM BUT THE SHIPS BOTH US AND THE OTHER ESCORT DESTROYED ES LIOS HAD TO KEEP UP AS MUCH STEAM AS WE COULD BECAUSE IF THE FIREWORKS STARTED WE WERE TO HAVE TO AT FULL SPEED RUSH UP AND DOWN THIS BIT OF COAST FIRING WHATEVER WE COULD PREVENT THEM TO THE OPOLLO WELL I COULD HEAR FROM THE GUNS BECAUSE I WAS IN THE ERM ER TS AND FROM THE DIRECTOR UMD BEFORE WE STARTED DOING ANYTHING AND I COULD HEAR THE PEOPLE IT THE GUN SAYING WELL I CAN SEE THE HEADLIGHTS THERE THEY'RE JUST JUST OVER THERE A LITTLE BIT TE CAR COMING DOWN GOING FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT AND I COULD HEAR ALL THIS THEYRE SAYIG I HOPE THEY CAN'T SEE US FROM WHER THEY ARE AND THEN HE SAID RIGHT THEY'VE STARTED DOWN THE OTHER END AND THEY STARTED FIRING DOWN AT THE OTHER END THEY ATTACKED HIS CONVOY AND MTHEY WERE BN YOU COULDN'T SEE THOTHER WEL YOU COULDN'T I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING ANYWAY CAUSE I WAS DOWN IN THE TS BUT I WAS GETTING ALL THE MESSAGES FROM E NOT THE TWO OFFICERS UP IN THE ER IRECTOR TOWER BUT FROM MY MATES ON A GUN B GUN X GUN AND Y GUN THEY WERE FUNDLING INN ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE MATE THAYD LOOK I THINK THAT BLOODY SMOKING OVER THERE YOU KNOW ON ET HOY CAN'T SEE US ANYWAY APPARENTLY THETHEY DIDN'T WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO MUCH SO WE WERE SLOWLY CRUISING UP AND DOWN AND THE EM OPOLLO STARTED LOWERING AUR MINES DEAD ON TIME DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK THE THE MINE LAYER IT'S A BIG MINE LAYER CARRIED A LOT OF MINE A BIG CRUISER THEY ARE AND ONCE THEY START LAYING THE MINE AND THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME IN THEY CAN'T STOP THEY'VE GOT TO DO THE WHOLE OF THEIR MINE LAYING BECAUSE THE MINEFIELD WAS BEING LAID SO THEY CAN'T TURN BACK THEY COULD ONLY GO ON AND CARRY ON LAYING THEIR MIND SO ANYWAY WEW'RE JUST GOING SLOWLY UP AND DOWN AND AND BECAUSE OUR SHIP WAS KEEPING STEAM UP READY FOR A QUICK DASH UP AND DOWN THE VALVE BLEW SO YOU GOT A NORMAL IS A WELL KNOWN DESTROYER WHOOT WHOP WHOO WHOOP WHICH WE DO EVERY TIME YOU COME IN AND OUT OF HARBOUR JUST TO SIGNAL AND APPARENTLY EVERYBODY WENT MAD THE CRUISER WENT MAD THEY WERE ING SILENT ROUTINE YOU KNOW AND M THE FACT THAT WE WERE NEVER SUSED OUT NOT TO THE VERY END AND I THINK IT MIGHT EVEN BE IF ANYBODY AD HEARD THAT WHOOP WHICH IS A WELL KNOWN BRITISH DESTROYER SIGNALLED TO SAY YOU KNOW I'M COMING INTO HARBOUR OR SOMEWHERE THEYD THOUGHT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T BE A BRITISH DESTROYER NOT BEING AS DAFT ENOUGH TO DO A THING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW SO ANYWAY ERM THEY LAID THEY LAID THE MINES AND THEN WE KNEW I DON'T KNOW BY SIGNAL OR WHAT SHE SAID ALL DONE YOU KNOW WE CARRIED OUT OUR MISSION SEE YOU BACK IN PORT AND I WAS AT THAT TIME LISTENING TO SOME OF THE ER MINER AND THEY WERE SAYING LOOK AT HE MOVE AND SHE WAS DOING FORTY KNOTS SHE WAS RUN OF THE FASTEST SHIPS THERE WERE AND THEY COULD SEE THE BOW WAVE MIND I ITIT IS NIGHT BUT ERM IT WAS STARLIGHT AND YOU COULD SEE YOU COULD SEE THE SHORE YOU COULD SEE THE PLACE WHERE THE GUNS WERE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A CRACK AT US AS THEY'D KNOWN AND ERM AWAY WENT THE ERM OPOLO AND RM AT SPEED N ERM WE TURNED AROUND BUT WE WE WENT AS FAR AAS WE COULD BUT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO AT A GOOD SPEED BECAUSE WEU GOT A SIGNAL THAT THE GERMANS HAD SUSED OUT THAT THEY WERE BEING ATTACKED ESPECIALLY FROM EGASUND WITH THE BATTLE WE HAD ON DOWN NOW AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE AFTERWARDS ON THE OPOLLO WHEN I CAPCHUE THEM THEY SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD AND THEY WERE IN THE ERM ERM WALESTER TELEGRAPHYES OFFICE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT WE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED ALTHOUGH FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BECAUSE THEY HAD PICKED US UP ON RADAR THE FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED AND HE THINKS THAT THE ERM APOLLO WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF COURSE HAD GIVEN THE RIGHT CHALLENGE ER ANSWER BUT THEN THEY CHALLENGED AGAIN LATER ON AND DIDN'T BECAUSE THE APOLLO HAD STARTED DISAPPEARING SO THEY SENT TORPEDO BOMBERS AFTER US AND RM THEY NEVER FOUND US SO WE GOT BACK OK SO THE MIADE WAS SUCCESSFUL OUR FORCE DOWN M FURTHER ININGASAND EEGASAND AND STOPPED THE CONVOY GOING UP TE ERMHAD THE GERMAN CONVOY THEYAD ERM SUNK ONE OR TWO OF THE SHIPS AND ONE OR TWO OF OUR SHIPS THA HAD INJURED PEOPLE BUT EM THE WHOLE MISSION WAS SUCCESSFUL IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU WERE EXPENDABLE WHEN YOU WERE OUT THEREOH YEAH WITH THE APPOINTMEN YOU ARE WHY IS I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A DESTROYER WAS A VALUABLE BIT OF KIT TALK A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF DESTROYER AND IT'S CONFERABLES YEAH BECAUSE I WHY SHOULD WHAT I SHALL BRING IN IS BECAUSE LATER ON ERM WE WHEN TOWARDS THE END OF THE WAR WHICH WON'T BE IN THAT ONE IS WHEN WE WERE A BIG FORCE ESCORTING ER SOME OF THE CRUISERS OUT TO THE FAR EAST WE ONLY TOOK THEM AS FAR AS GIBRALTAR YOU SEE AND THEN ANOTHER FORCE TAKES OVER BUT WE WERE ESCORTING HA BATTLESHIP THE RENOWN AND WE WERE THE CLOSE ESCORT ONE DESTROYER EACH SIDE FAIRLY CLOSE WHEREAS OTHERS WERE FURTHER OUT AND ITAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY LIKE THIS AND I WASN'T ON WATCH IWA JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE BUT WE WERE QUITE CLOSE BECAUSE FTHE CLOSE ESCORT YOU SEE AND I'M JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE AND OVER THE TUNNOY COMES THE VOICE FROM THE CAPTAIN WE'RE NOW REACHING A DANGEROUS AREA AND THERE MIGHT BE U BOATS AROUND IF A U BOAT AS FIRED A TORPEDOE AND THAT IS ERMYOU KNOW AND WHAT E E WE SEE THAT TO TRACK OF THAT TORPEDOE HEADING TOWARDS BIG SISTER WHICH THEY CALLE THE RENOWN THEN WE STOP IT YOU KNOW WHAT WE MEAN YOU STOP IT AND THERE'S ME LOOKING OVER THE SIDE LOOKING AT THE TORPEDO BOLGE ON THE RENOWN AND THINKING TO YOURSELF YES YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE TWO HUNDRED MEN JUST A TOP A TORPEDO BENDING THE TORPEDO BOLDE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF A DESTROYER WELL R ROLE OF MOST DESTROYERS IS THEY'RE FAST THE MANEUVERABLE AND THEY'RE LIKE A SMALLER VERSION OF A CRUISER THEY HAVE ALLDE GUNNERY BUT SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'VE GOT FOUR BIG GUNS FOUR POINT FIVE BIG GUNS AND OTHER SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'VE GOT ALL THOSE THE ONE THING THEY'VE GOT EXTRA EM APART FROM THE SMALLER SIDE SCALE DOWN ER THE BIG SHIPS HAVE NOT GOT ANTI SUBMARINE EQUIPMENT THEY'VE GOT TORPEDOES AND THINGS BUT UNLESS THEY'RE SUBMARINES ON THE SURFACE THEY'VE GOT NO DEPTH CHARGES SO ERM A DESTROYER HAS DEPTH CHARGES SO WEWE'RE THERE TO BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIFFERENCE THE REASON WHY YOU GOT A DESTROYER AS WELL IS JUST AS I SAID IF THE ERM CAPITAL SHIP OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU'R GUARDING IS TORPEDOED THE LAST RESULT IS YOU GETTING E WAY OF THE TORPEDOE THEY'D RATHER LOSE A SHIP THATS ONLY GOT TWO H TWO HUNDRED MEN ON BOARD THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MEN ON THE BATTLESHIP REMOTE AS IT MIGHT BE IF ITD GOT A TORPEDO BOLGE AND THIS IS WHY WE SHORT A OF SHORT OF DESTROYERS BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM GET GET LOST BECAUSE THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN A TORPEDO IS SIGHTED IS TO GO TO ATTACK THE SUBMARINE THAT FIRED IT YOU SHOULD BE NEAR ENOUGH TO GET IN THE WAY OF TE TORPEDO IF IT HAPPENS TO BE HEADING YOUR WAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALKED A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WEREN'T ATIN YOU WERE VERY YOUNG CREW WAS THERE A MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE ON BOARD WHERE YOU THOUGHT WEERE WORKING BRILLIANTLY NOW WELL NOT REALLY YOU JUST SORT OF FIT IN UM PART OF LIFE IS YOU MANAGED TO FIT INTO EVERY SITUATION IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH AND M I I WAS NEVER WORRIED UM YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD SWIMMER ER YOU MUST BE ALRIGHT EVEN IF THE SHIP SINKS BUT THEN WHEOWHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU SPEAK TO OTHER PEOPLE ER YOU'VE GOT SEA BOOTS ON AT THE TIME ER YOU HAVE A BELT WHICH ERM SHOULD SAVE YOU WHICH YOU WEAR ALL THE TIME AT SEA BUT YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT BELT BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT GETS IN THE WAY OF YOUR ARMS AND EVERYTHING SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU HAVE TO JUMP INTO THE HOGIN AS THEY CALL IT THE SEA THAT BELT MUSTN'T BE BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT MIGHT BREAK YOUR ARMS SO YOU'RE EXPECTED TO BLOW THAT UP WHEN YOU HIT THE SEA AND M I CAN'T SEE HOW YOU GET LUCKILY I NEVER HAD TO BUT I HAVE A SURVIVORS THAT HAVE TOLD ME YES I HAD TO BLOW IT UP AS SOON AS I HIT THE WATER AND I HAD NO BREATH AT ALL LEFT SO I COULDN'T BLOW IT UP BUT THE SEA BOATS DRAGG YOU DOWT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE WEARING SO IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THING WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG EVENT YOU RECALL THEM ERM WELL IT WAS REALLY MUNDANE MOST OF THE THING EVEN M ER AS ESCORT TO THE MONSTERS THAT WE DID YOUR ENEMY IN MOST CASES WAS ASEA GOT BATTERED LEFT RIGHT ANTH CENTRE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE CREEN MARY AND QUEEN ELIZABETH BECAUSE AS WE TOOK THEM OUT OF THE CLYDE WE ZIGJAGGED ALL THE WAY WITH THEM AND WE KEPT UP WITH THEM NTIL THEY REACHED HEIR TOP SPEED WHICH ERM WAS TE DISTANCE ABOUT FURTHER OF THE WAY ACROSS AND THEN WE LEFT THEM AND WE EITHER WAITED AROUND FOR THE NEXT ONE COMING IN FOINSTANCE WE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE QUEEN MARY OUT AND WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO WAIT JUST A FEW HOURS FOR THE QUEEN ELIZABETH TO COME IN AND ERM ALL THE TIME ONE OF YOU MIGHT PICK UP ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU AT THO QUEEN MARY WOULD HAVE ITS OWN ASDIC BESIDES ITS OWN RADAR AND WE OF COURSE WWERE AT THE ASDIC AND THE RADR AND OUR COHAK PERHAPS TE CAVALIER WOULD BE THE SAME WELL WHEN WE'D STEAM OUT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE APART HAT THE EXTREMES OF YOUR ASDIC CIRCLE YOU RADAR CIRCLE SO THAT YOU DIDN'T INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHER'S RECEIT OF THE WAVE AND IF WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUBMARINE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A WRECK WELL IMMEDIATELYWE'D RUN UP A BLACK FLAG ON OUR FLAG DECK SO THE QUEEN MARY WOULD KNOW AND THEY'LL SHOW TO THE CAVALIER WOULD KNOW THAT WE' PICKED UP AN ECHO IMMEDIATELY WE'D HIVE OFF TO ATTACK THAT ECHO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE IN TROUBLE IF IT IS IF THAT'S A U BOAT IT MIGHT HAVE ALREADY FIRED ITS TORPEDOE AND THIS IS WHERE YOU TURN OFF SWIFTLY AT FULL SPEED IF YOU CAN IF YOU GOT BEM C AF YOU CA TURN OFF LEFT OR RIGHT YOU HIT WITH A BEM C THE DESTROYER YOU GOT HARDLY ANY DRAFT YOU'LD TURN OVER STRAIGHT AWAY SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY VERYGELL YOU NEVER DID WHETHEVER ITIS LUCK OR IS BY JUDGMENT I DON'T KNOW BUT ANYWAY THEN IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HIT BY A TORPEDO THEN YOU'D FIND YOUR WAY TO WHEREVER THAT ERM ECHO WAS AND YOU WOULD ATTACK THE ECHO SO YOU'D LOOSE OFF ABOUT TWO DEPTH CHARGES FROM ONE SIDE TO FROM THE OTHER AND ROLL OFF OFF THE TRU RACKS FROM THE REAR SO HE'S PATTERN OF ABOUT TEN CHARGES WELL IF THE U BOAT IS A VERY EXPERIENCED ONE AND HE WAS WATCHING YOU ON THE PERISCOPE THE WOULDN'T BE THERE WHEN YOU ARRIVED HE WOULD EITHER HAVE GONE DOWN LOW OR HE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED IN E OTHER DIRECTION BUT AT LEAST YOU KEPT HIM DOWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM HITTING YOUR CHARGE AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO TRY TO CATCH IT UP TAK ABOUT HALF A DAY BECAUSE TE THEY'RE KEEPING THE SAME SPEED EVEN AFTER TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO LEAVE TO QUEEN MARY OR THO QUEEN ELIZABETH THE QUEEN MARY WOULD CARRY ON IT WOULDN'T STOP AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS TAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY'D ACTUALLY TORPEDOED TO QUEEN MARY THEN THEY WOULD HAVE LOST A LOT OF LIVES BECAUSE WHILE YOUR THE QUEEN MARY IF IT'S COMING BACK IN YOU'LD HAVE A FULL COMPLIMENT OF AMERICAN GIS AND THATWOULD BE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND BE CARRYING NOW THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TIGHTEN UP THEIR WATERTIGHT DOORS BECAUSE THEY'D GO IN FROM THE DIFFERENT DECKS ALL THE TIME IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF WE GO INTO ACTION STATIONS THEN WE'D CLOSE OUR WATERTIGHT DOORS WHICH MEANSIF YOU'R TORPEDO YOUR MIND IT WILL ONLY DAMAGE THE COMPARTMENT WHERE YOU'RE WITHIN SO THE SHIP MOST LIKELY WON'T SINK BUT IF IT'S ON THE QUEEN MARY THEN THEY'VE GOT NO CHANCE OF ANY OF THEIR WATERTIT DOORS BEING CLOSED BECAUSE THEY'RE TRAVELLING BETWEEN THE DIFFERENTDI DECKS THEY'RE PERHAPS SLEEPING ON ONE DECK TRAVELLING UP THE NEXT DECK TO EAT FOOD ANOTHER DECK FOR EXERCISE THE TOP DECK IS ALWAYS EXERCISE SO TOU COULDN'T HAVE CLOSED THE CREW WATERFIT DOORS SO ANY OF THOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISASTERS YOU WOULD FIND WHAT WAS IT LIKE SEEING H THE QUEEN MARY THE QUEEN ELIZABETH THE SAILING ONE DID YOU HAVE ANY FRIDAY WOULD THEY MEA WERE THESE SHIPS THAT YOU KNEW OF AND WERE PROUD OF ANYWHERE WELL ERM ALL ALL WE REALLY KNEW WAS THAT WE WUR GOING TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS OR BRING ONE OF THE MONSTERS IN OR O IF IT WAS THE QUEEN MARY AND WE WERE IN GREENOCK THEN WE WOULD KNOW ITS THE GTHE COME IN WHERE WOU WERE TAKEN OUT AND THAT'S ALYS GOT THREE FUNNELS ANYWAY IF WE PICKED UP IF YHEU'S GOT THREE FUNNELS IT'S T QUEEN MARY AND SH GOT TWO FUNNELS IT'S QUEEN ELIZABETH AND SO ON YOU GOT FOUR MFOUR FUNNELS WITH YHE AQUITANIA AND SO IT WENT ON BUT YOU WERE NEVER TOLD YOU WOUL JUST SAIL OUT AND EM GO TO A RENDEVOO WHERE YOU WOULD WAIT AROUND OR YOU'VE ALREADY CONTACTED THAT SHIP TO SAY YOU'RE THERE HAND YOUD BRING IT IN VERY OFTEN E EVEN WE TWO WERE ESCORTS ONE WOULD BE AT GREENOKE AT THE CLYDE AND THE OTHER WOULDB DOWN AT LIVERPOOL AND WE WOULD REACH A POINT OF RENDEVOO GOING OUT OF THE CLYDE AND THE OTHER ONE THE CAVALIRE PERHAPS COME OUT OF LIVERPOOL ANTHEN WE'D STEAM UP TOGETHER TO THE ERM E RONDEVOO POINT FOR THE EM THE MONSTER DID THIS HAPPENED ALMOST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK OR ERM ONE OR OTHER US WE NEVER HAD THE SAME COHALT ERM BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T ALWAYS BE IN THE SAME AREA THEY'D BEE DOING SOMETHING ELSE AND BETWEEN THAT IF YOU'RE DUTY SHIP IF ERM THERE WAS AIRCRAFT CARRIER WHICH HAPPENED IN ONE CASE EM A BEN TORPEDOD WE'D JUST COME DOWN FROM SCAPPA TO ER TO GREENOCK AND WE'D JUST ARRIVED EAT THE HARBOUR ENTRANCE WE WENT STRAIGHT TO AN OILER BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO FILL UP WITH OIL BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO OUT AND JUST AS WE ERE AT THE OILER WE GOT AN EMERGENCY CALL TO SAY THAT RM AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER HAD BEEN TORPEDOED JUST OUT IN THE ERM ER CLYDE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CLYDE SO WE ERM JUST LET GO FROM THE OILER AND WE WENT STRAIGHT OUT TO ER TO TTHE THANE IT WAS E AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND STRANGELY ENOUGH SHE WAS ON HER OWN SHE 'D COME FROM LONDONDERRY SHE'D HAD NO ESCORT M LUCKILY SHE DIDN'T HAVE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF ER OF SEAMAN AND SO FORTH AND SHE WOUD COME INTO ERM TO THE CLYDE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY TORPEDOED THAT THEY TORPEDOED ERM A MERCHANT SHIP AT THE SAME TIME AND THE U BOAT GOT AWAY ALTHOUGH WE WENT TO ATTACK IT IT WAS DARK AND ER T THE OTHERS I THINK LOOKING FOR THE U BOAT AFTERWARDS WHERE WE CAGOING BACK INTO HARBOUR HO HOW LONG ARE YOU AT SEA WHEN YOUERE OUT IN THE ATLANTIC OHOW OFTEN ARE YOU GOING BACK TO BASE AND GETTING LAND LOS IN A DESTROYER NOT VERY LONG BECAUSE YOU YOU HADN'T GOT THAT MUCH FUEL AND THERE'S ALWAYS USING YOUR STOP SPEED ALWAYS MANEUVERING YOUR ONLY WAY OF GETTING FUEL IF YOU'RE OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS FOR FROM ONE OF THE BIGGER SHIPS EITHER FROM AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER OR SOMETHING THATAS BIG AS A BELFA A CRUISER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ALSO FOOD YOUR FOOD RUNS OUT AFTER A SHORT WHILE SO THE ONLY TIME WEWERE REALLY OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS WHEN WE WRE UP AT SCAPA WHEN YOUW'RE EM WORKING UP WHEN WEWARE GOING OUT ON ERM FOUR AYS TO ER TO HELP TO SINK THE TIP TURPITS O DOING OTHER JOBS E MOST OF THE OTHERS IT WAS A CASE OF GOING OUT JUST FOR A DAY OR TWO TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS AND THEN COME BACK WITH THE MONSTER OR TAKE ONE OUT AND LEAVE IT IN WHICH CASE YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO TO LONDON DERRY PERHAPS AND THEN WE'D COME OUT OF LONDON DERRY AGAIN AND YOU KNOW GO OUT ON THAT SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT RESPECT THAT ER U KNOW WE WERE NOT OUP FOR VERY LONG THERE WAS ONLY ERM ONE OCCASION WHEN E WE WAS OUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME IT MUST HAVE BEEN OVER TE FIVE DAYS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE OCCASION WAS BUT WE HAD RUN OUT OF FOOD AND WE WAS FURTHER UP IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND OUR CAPTAIN WAS A X FISHERY FLEET MAN HE HAD HIS OWN FISHERY FLEET THEN SO WHAT HE DECIDED TO DO AS WE WUD RUN OUT OF FOOD HE SAID I KNOW WHERE THE FISH EM ARE SO HE GUIDED THE SHIP UP TO WHERE HE KNEW THEY WERE PICKED UP A SHOL ON THE RADAR ON THE ASDECK DROPPED AT IT STEP SHIRGE LOWERED THE BOAT PICKED UP ALL WATE FISH THAT CAME UP THAT WAS STUNNED HE STOOD ON THE FOLKSILL WE SAW HIM STAND ON THE FOLKSILL AND SAID UT MY MIND PICKED TE FIGURES ONE WE LIVED ON FISH FOR A FUMERAL DAYS AFTER THAT SO THE ONE VERY GOOD BUT OUR RUNS WERE MOSTLY EM JUST ABOUT FIVE DAYS AT THE TIME BUT THAT MEANT THAT EVERY TIME WE CAME INTO THE ER ER EITHER SCAPPER OR IF WE WERE IN LIVERPOOL OR TO THEDECLIDE WE HAD TO ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF FUEL ON BOARD BECAUSE ER IF YOU'RE A IF YOUR E DUTY DESTROYER AND THEN IF SOMETHING COMES UP WHERE A SHIPS BEEN SUNK YOU HAD TO GO OUT STRAIGHT AWAY AND YOU MIGHT BE OUT FOR A LONG TIME LOOKING FOR A SUBMARINE OR MORE THAN ON SUBMARINE SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THE FACT THAT E WE NEVER WENT OUT FOR A LONG TIME OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OILING AT SEA WHICH IS A DANGEROUS PRACTICE ANYWAY AND ER PICKING UP FOOD AND EVERYTHING FOR FROM IT CAN YOU DESCRIBE RADIAR YES RM THE JOB YOU WERE DOING RADIAR YESRADAR YOU DO WELL FIRST OF ALL WHEN I WAS ON THE RADOFF SET IT WAS ONLY A SMALL SET AND ER IT DIFFERENT TYPES THE TWO NINE THREE THAT IS HIGH UP ON THE MAST AND THAT ESPECIALLY FOR PICKING UP URM AIRCRAFT OR SURFACE SHIPS REALLY ANY ANY DISTANCE I CAN'T I CAN'T THINK OF THE RANGERANGE OF IT BUT IT SENDS OUT A SIGNAL FROM THERE WHICH OF COURSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT ANYTHING YOU DON'T GET IT BACK BUT IF IT HITS ANYTHING EVEN CLIFFS OR AN AIRCRAFT OR SURFACE SHIP THEN IT BALANCES BACK AND ON THE SCREEN YOU ERM WHICH IS A AROUND SCREEN AND THE ER THE CURSER IS GOING ROUND ALL THE TIME THAT WILL SHOW A BLEP AND THAT BLEP YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S EM A CLOUD WHICH IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE DEPENDING ON YOUR RADAR WHETHER IT'S DOING ER VERTICAL OR ANGLAR AND YOU WILL THEN READ OFF THE DISTANCE AN ANGLE OF EVERYTHING IF THIS IS MOSTLY ONON A LEVEL BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER SCREAM WHICH GIVES YOU THE HEIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT SO YOU USE ONE WITH THE OTHER THAT T RM WHEN THAT ERM SIGNAL ELECTRONIC SIGNAL HITS ANYTHING THEN IT RETURNS AND THEN YOU READ OFF THE DISTANCE OF IT BUT IS IT EASY TO USE IT NOT IT'S EASIER TO USE ERM WE WHERE YOU FIND THE DIFFIICULTY IS BY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT EITHER LAND BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF IT ON THERE OR IF IT'S A SMALL BLIP THEN ITS AN AIRCRAFT A SHIP OR WHATEVER I IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE USING ONE TYPE OF RADAR IT'S ONLY ERM S ONLY HORIZONTAL IF YOU'RE USING ANOTHER ONE IT CAN BE HORIZONTAL OR AN AIRCRAFT AND IT WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD DISTANCE THE TIME IT TAKES OF COURSE IS BASED ON IF IT TAKES TEN SECONDS TO GET FROM THERE TO THERE THEN ITS AND YOU READ IT OFF ON BETWEEN LUCKILY AT OUR POINT IN THE WAR WE NEVER HAD ANY THROUBBLE OF AIRCRAFT THE ONLY TIME WE WOULD HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THAT IS IF THE TORPEDO BOMBERS HAD BEEN SENT AFTER US OFF NORWAY THEN YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO USE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD KNOW THE A YOU'D HAVE TO USE THE TWO RADAR SETS THEN THE ONE THAC GIVES YOU A SIGNAL IN THE HEIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT AND THE OTHER ONE WHICH GIVES YOU TE DISTANCE OF IT M THEN YOU'RE TRAINED TO KNOW WHICH ADE THE DIFFERENCE AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT ASFAR AS I CAN REMEMBER IF IT WAS ONE OF YOUR OWN AIRCRAFT IT WOULD HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION SIGNAL WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW ON YOUR RADAR SET BEFORE ITAD GOT TO YOU SO YOU WOUD HAVE TO BE HAVE PRETTY WELL EXPERIENCED BUT MY TIME WAS NOT ALWAYS ON A RADAR SAT YOU WER SOMETIMES ANA LOOKOUT AS A SEAMAN WHERE YOU'RE SITTING UP IN A LOOKOUT BOX ON THE STARBOARD SIDE A MINE AND YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR AIRCRAFT WHICH WAS NOT VERY OFTEN WE SAR ERM SURFACE SHIPS OR MORE THANLIKELY YOU WERE LOOKING OUT FOR A LITTLE TINY PERISCOPE WHICH IS VERY HARD TO SEE IN A ROUGHER ATLANTIC OR YOU MIGHT BE UNLUCK ENOUGH TO SEE THE TRACK OF A TORPEDO COMING TOWARD YOU IN WHICH CASE YOU GET INTO A PANIC AND ER CALL OUT QUICKLY TO THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE MTHE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE EM THE CAPTAIN OR THE M OFFICER O THE OF THE WATCH AT THE TIME IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE NOW DAYS IT'S ENCLOSED BUT IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE SO THE BRIDGE IS HERE YOU'VE GOT TA LOOKOUT S JUST HERE TO JUST CALL OUT TO THAT PERSON ON THE BRIDGE THE OFFICER SHIP BEARING RED FIVE O GREEN FIVE O WEWHER YOUR POSITION IS ANGLE OF SIGHT IF IT'S AN AIRCRAFT AND YIU' IMMEDIATELY LOOK AT IT AND DECIDE WHAT ACTION TO TAKE BUT IF YOU'RE ON THAT LOOKOUT POSITION WHICH I ALWAYS ON QUITE A LOT AS A SEAMAN IS ROUGH CAUSE AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN ALL THE TIME EBEING A DESTROYER YOU'RE ALMOST A SUBMARINE AT TIMES THE WHOLE OF THE SEA COMES UP OVER YOU AND YOU GET KNOCKED BACK AGAINST THE SURCHLIGHT AND INK WATS VERY DAMP THAT IS VERY ROUGH UNCOMFORTABLE UTAND THIS IS WHAT D YOU GET USED TO YOU USED TO WEAR ERM A SPECIAL SUIT WHICH COVERED YOUR COMPLETELY WATERPROO SUIT WITH CAPE OP BINING EM BUT EVEN EVEN THAT THE WATER BOT ALL THE WAY DOWN AND YOU GOT SOAKIN WET I REMEMBER COMING OFF WATCH ON ONE OCCASION LIKE THIS ECAUSE NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO CLIMB BACK DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE LADDERS OF THE SHIP BECAUSE THE DOORS THAT YOU WOULD GO IN AND OUT IN PORT WERE OPEN WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA THOSE DOORS WOILD BE CLOSED BECAUSE THE WATER COMES IN THOSE SO YOU HAVE TO CLIMB DOWN LADDERS DOWN THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP NOT NOT OUTSIDE IN THE SEA BUT CLIMB DOWN FROM THE TOP DECK TO THE LOWER DECK AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL THE WAVE IN IT HITS YOU YOU CAN GET WASHED AWAY SOYOU HOLD ON VERY TIGHT WELL THIS WAS THE MIDDLE WATCH THAT I CAN RECALL WHICH IS FROM TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING FOR TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BUT YOU'RE NOT ON WATCH ER LOOKOUT ALL THAT TIME OF THE FOUR HOUR WATCH YOU DO DEFFERENT JOBS HALF HOUR ON LOOKOUT HALF HOUR PERHAPS ON THE RADAR SET OFF HOUT ONE HALF HOUR BEHIND A GUN WHERE THERE'S A GU YOU'D BECOME PART OF THE GUN CREW SO IF YOU DID HAVE TO GO INTO ACTION YOU WOULD DO THE SHOOTING WHILE THE REAL GUN CREW IS CALLED UP TO TAKE OVER FROM YOU WELL ON THIS OCCASION ITAD BEEN VERY WET OUTSIDE I'D GOT SOAK IN AND TIRED I SAY MIDDLE WATCH PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK I'D COME DOWN SO I WENT DOWN TO MY MESS DECK WHICH I DIDN'T FOLCL IT WAS A ROUGH PART OF THE SHIP ER I HADN'T SLUNG MY HAMMOCK I'D SLEPT ON THE ER CUSHIONS AND THIS TIME I I DIDN'T FANCY TO S SLEEPING ON THE CUSHIONS BECAUSE THE SHIP WAS GOING SO MUCH THIS WAY AND I KNEW I'D COME OFF THE CUSHIONS SO I GOT DOWN UNDER THE MESS TABLE THERE WAS ABOUT THAT MUCH WATER ON THE FLOOR THE DECK SORRY NOT THE FLOOR ON THE DECK ABOUT THAT MUCH SO I GOT ALL MY CODE ON THERE THIS SUITSUIT AS YOUCALLED IT AND EVERYTHING AND I'M LAYING DOWN THERE OFF TO SLEEP STRAIGHT AWAY NEXT THING I KNOW A FOOT HAD TOUCHED ME AND I OPENED MY BLEERY EYES AND THERE WIS THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH AND THE LEADING SEAMAN AN THE MESS AND HE WAS SAYING TO ME I'M TOLD THIS IN THE MORNING BY THE LEADING HAND OF THE MESS HEHE SAID THE OFFICER SAID TO YOU COME ON SEAMAN YOU CAN'T SLEEP UNDER THERE IT'S TOO WET AND I SAID AND HE LOOKED AT THE LEADING HAND AND SAID WHAT DID HE SAY AND THE LEADMAN I I DON KNO I DON'T READ THAT LANGUAGE AND SO OH WELL WE BETTER OW YOU LET HMIM SLEEP THERE AND HE LEFT ME THERE NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT IT TO A E O E WELL YO YOU'RE LYING IN THAT MUCH WATER THE THE DECKS OF THE SHIPS WEREINSIDE YOU KNOW INSIDE YOUR MESS DECK THE WATER JUST IT'S RM ONE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE AND A LITTLE BIT WARMER INSIDE SO YOU GOT ALL HUMIDITY AL THE WATER RUNS DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE DECKS ANY TIME YOU'RE ON THE CAVALIER YO YOU HAVE A LOOK AND THE INSIDE FBCAUSE YOUR METAL WORK OF THE SHIPS SIDE ITWAS ONLY ABOUT EIGHT OF AN INCH NO THICKER THAN THAT AND RM SO THERE THEY ALWAYS YOU GOT WATER MOST OF THE TIME OYOU ON YOUR MESS DECKS WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA AND YOU'RE IN HARBOUR YOU NOT TOO BAD SO IT GETS A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE THERE WAS ANOTHER TIME WHEN WE WORKED WITH THE QUEEN MARY AND WE HAD TO PICK HER UP TO BRING HER IN WE WENT OUT AND IT AS IN EONE OF THE ROUGHEST STORMS TEWE HAD ABOUT THREE REALLY ROUGH STORMS IN THE PERIOD THAT WE WORKING IN THE ATLANTIC AND WE HAD TO AT THIS TIME ITO'LD BE ABOUT MARCH NINETEEN FORTY FIVE WE HAD TO GO AND PICK UP TQUEEN MARY NOW TTHE STORM HAD BEEN RAGING ALL THE WAY FROM AMERICA AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE ERTHE BIG STORM THAT HAD COME ACROSS OUR WAY AND THE QREEN MARY BROUGHT IT WITH US SORT OF THING AND WE PICKED HER UP AND ER I THINK WE WERE A DAY OR MORE WAITING TO PICK HER UP BECAUSE EVEN SHE HAD BEEN HELD UP QUIE A BAD STORMS WELL WE AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAS HE SISTER SHIP AT THAT TIME BUT WE GOT REALLY BENT UP WE LOST A MOTORBOAT WE LOST EM ONE OF THE ERM WHALERS ERM AND WE GOT REALLY KNOCKED THEM OUT AND WHEN WE GOT ERM TOWARDS THE CLYDE THE THE QUEEN MARY KNOWING THAT IT WAS IN THE AREA THAT THERE WOULD BE U BOATS HAD TO RELY ON EUR SPEED BUT COULDBEBIT SO AS AS WE ERM GOT WITHIN HAILING DISTANCE I SUPPOSE IF YOU SAY F THE CLYDE AND THE QUEEN MARY DECIDED SHE COULDN'T SLOW DOWN TO KEEEP UP WITH US CAUSE ITT WAS TOO ROUGH FOR US WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER AND SO SHE JUST FLASHED A MESSAGE SEE YOU IN THE CLYDE SET AF AND SHE KEPT UP HER SPEED AND GOT INTO THE GALYDE NOW SHE HAD THE WHOLE OF THE FRONT OF HER BRIDGE STOVED IN AND IAS A BIG SHIP AD WELL UP IN THE AIR THEY HAD A LOT OF CASUALTIES BECAUSE THEY ERE CARRYINDG THEMOUT TWELVE THOUSAND TROOPS AND M THIS WAS NOW LATE AT NIGHT I THINK OFOUT UM ELEVEN O'CLOCK TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT BUT ANYWAY SHE GOT INTO THE CLYDE WWITHOUT ANYTHING BUT DAMAGE FROM FROM THE SEA WE LIMPED IN LATER ON NOW IN THE CLYDE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO UM ANCHOR AND WE COULDN'T GO FURTHER IN TO GREENOK TO GREENOK BECAUSE AFTER THAT YOU GO THROUGH THE BOOM AND THE BOOM IS CLOSED AT NIGHT UNLHISS IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY SARY TO OPEN THE BOOM WHICH PREVENTS OR HELPS TO PREVENT AN U BOATS GETTING AT THAT POINT SO AT THE OTHER SIDE WHERE WE HAD TO UM TI UP TO A BOY WE HAVE TWO BOY JUMPERS TO TI UP TO A BOY YOU HAVE TO STOP AND YOU HAVE TO LOWER YOUR WHAILOR WITH THE BOY JUMPER AND THE ROWERS IN IT TO TAKE YOU TO THE BOY WITH THE CHAIN TO CLIP IT TO THE BOY WELL IF I'VE GIVEN YOU A PICTURE OF HOW ROUGH THE STORM WAS IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT FIRST WHALER WE WE ERM EM LET DOWN ONTO THE WATER MANAGED TO GET DOWN SAFELY BUTIT GOT WASHED AWAY WITH A CREW IN IT FURTHER DOWN THE CLYDE THAT WAS A WAY FOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO LOWER ANOTHER WHAILER ALL OF US WAS UP ON THE FOLKSIL YOU KNOW ALL THE SEAMEN THAT COULD HELP WAS UP ON THE FOLKSI AND BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE YOUR ANCHOR YOU'RE JUST USING YOUR ANCHOR CHAIN WHICH GOES WITH A WIRE ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE ANCHOR CHAIN AND THE E WHAILER HAS TO TAKE THIS WIRE TO THE BOY TO CLAMP IT ONTO THE BOY AND THEN THE BOYS PULLED BY THE ANCHOR CHAIN NEARER THE SHIP SO THAT THEY CLIP IT ON SO ANYWAY THEY LOWERED THE SECOND WHALER THE BOY JUMPER MANAGED TO GET ONTO THE BOY AND IN DOING SO BROKE HIS WRIST AND ER IN THE END AFTER I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO CLIP UP TO THE BOY AND M THE ER CAPTAIN SAIDTOPS ALL AROUND ER I HATED TE SMELL OF RUM ANANYWAY AND NEVER WOULD AVE HAD TEM TOP ECAUSE IT'S HORRIBLE BUT EWE I HAD IT THAT NIGHT BECAUSE WE WERE FROZEN FROZEN STIFF AND ER WE LANDED TO GET AWAY WITH IT BUT NOTHING WAS EVER SAID ABOUT THIS TYPE OF THING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH E PEOPLE AT THE PORKS KNEW THE BIG SHIPS COME AND COME IN IT WAS NOT ER A THING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THE GERMANS ALSO KNEW TAT E THEY WERE BRINGING ALL THESE LARGE NUMBERS BETWEEN ER TEN AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS IT COULD CARRY ERM EM ANY OF THE U BOAT CAPTAINS I UNDERSTAND AND THIS IS NORMAL KNOWLEDGE WERE OFFERED A LARGE SUM OF MONEY THOUSANDS OF ER I WHAT THEY DO A TA FD JEOYCE MARK DOISH MARK THOUSANDS DOSH MARKS AND THE HIGHEST OF THE BA OF HONOURS TO HAVE KNOCKED DOWN ANY ONE OF THESE MONSTERS BUT WE NEVER LOST ONE U FORTUNATELY E HAP YOU TO SAY BUT THE QUEAM ARY ERM WAS REALLY BATTERED VERY BADLY BATTERED HOW WE DIDN'T GET TURNED OVER I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHEN ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT BIG SEAS WHAT SORT OF SIZE ARE YOU TALK WELL IF YOU'RE ERM THE SEASE ITSELF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL EM THEREI IT'S GENERALLY KNOWN THAT SOME OF THE WAVES WERE SIXTY FOOT HIGH NOW IF YOU THINK OF SIXTY FOOT GOING UP THAT WAY WHEN YOU GO UP TO THE WAVE AND YOU COME DOWN TO THE TROUGH YOUVE GOT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOOT AND THEREIS NO WAY YOU CAN CUT THROUGH THOSE WAVES ERM THE BIG SHIPS ARL THE SMALL SHIPS YOU ACTUALLY GO UP ON THAT WAVE AND THEN YOU FEEL IT AND YOU COME DOWN WITH A CRUNCH LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU UP TO TH NEXT ONE AND ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CORK SCREN YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT STILL AND YOU GET USED TO THIS AFTER ABOT THE FIRST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE YOU GOT BRUISED ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE YOU GO THROUGH ERM A NORMAL RMCORRI FLATS THEY'RE CALLED ON A DESTROYER THE NORMAL CORRIDOR ON THE FLOOR ON A AND DESTROYER RIGHARD ABOUT THAT WIDE WELL WHEN YOU FIRST GO ABOARD ONE LIKE THAT AND IT WAS FAIRLY CALM WHEN YOU SET OUT FOR SCAPPER FROM GREENOCK BUT AS YOU WALK ALONG THE DECK COMES UP TO MEET YOU IT GOES UP AND YOU HIT YOUR FEET AS YOU GO DOWN ON THE DECK UTBEFORE YOU KNOW IT THAT DECK HAS GONE AWAY AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN AND THIS HITS YOU FROM THE TOP AND THEN WHIL THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING THIS THIS BULK HITS YOU ACTUAL YOU KNOW THAT BUKET HITS YOU SO IN TIME YOU LEARNED TO WALK LIKE A SAILOR AND AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN YOU GO DOWN WITH IT AND COME UP WITH IT AND THAT'S YOU'LL FIND SAILORS ANDWHEN YOU GET ASHORE THEY WORK WITH A ROL WALK WITH A ROL THAT IS JUST THAT STILL WALKING ON THE SHIP SO AFTER THE END OF THE WAR RI E DAY RIGHT YOU'RE NOT FINISHED YEAH AN V DAY ITSELF WE WERE MS AS THE NINTH OF MAY WE WERE BRINGING IN THE ELDER FRANKS AND WE GOT NOTICE THAT THE PIEACE ERM ER HAD BEEN DECLARED FOR THE NEXT DAY EM WE WE GOING INTO GINTO GREENOCK SO WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN THE LAST OFTHE ONE SHIP CONVOYS BEFORE THE WAR ENDED WE ARRIVED IN GREENOK I BELIEVE IT WAS EITHER WEDNESDAY OR SUNDAY ERM HALF THE SHIPS COMPANY WAS ALLOWED LEAVE WHICH WASN'T ME IN FRADD I WASN'T ONE OF THE SHIPS COMPANY BUT THEY WENT ASHORE TO GREENOCK NDAN HAD A GOOD ERM YOU KNOW TIME SO THEN WE STILL CARRIED ON WITH SOME OF THESE CONVOYS AFTER THERE BECAUSE ERM THERE WAS QUITE A FEW OF THE U BOATS THAT APPARENTLY MISSING END LOT OF THEM E ONE OR TWO WENT TO BRAZIL OR WHATEVER SO THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE THAT IF THERE WAS A ROE U BOAT AROUND THEY COULD HAVE KNOCKED DOWN SOME OF THE ERM MONSTERS WE WERE STILL BRINGING BACK IN BUT WE HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL BUT TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT ANYWAY UM WE WERE THEN DESTINED TO GO ACROSS TO ERM THE END TRIED TO END THE JAPANESE WAR SO TWO BY TWO OR FLOTILLA WENT IN FOR REFITS WE WENT IN FOR REFIT LATE IN MAY ERM JUNE EM BECAUSE WE WERE GOING OUT THERE ANYWAY BUT FORTUNATELY WHILE EI WAS ON ERM LEAVE TO GO OUT THERE THE SHIP WAS DOWN AT DAVONPORT BEING REFITTED THE WAR ENDED SO I STILL GOT A TELEGRAM TO SAY DAY LEAVE EXTRA DAYS LEAVE EXLA WHEN WE CAME BACK TO THE SHIP WE STILL HAD TO GO OUT THERE BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING TO CLEAR UP AFTER THE WAR WELL ERM THE WHOLE OF OUR FLOTILLA WERE OUT THERE THEN WE WERE THE LAST TWO SO AS WE WENT OUT GIBRALTAR MALTA AIDAN AND PLACES LIKE THAT WE LLFE THOUGHT WE WAS INVER A LOVELY SUMMAS CREIS BUT THEN WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE NO WHEN WE GOT TO TRINKHAMALE THAT WAS OUR NAVAL BASE WEE BASED AT TRINHAMALEE AND WERE ALSO BASED AT SINGAPORE OR WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE ERM THIS WAS JUST ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THE WAR AND EM WE WERE CARRYEND OUT AN EXERCISE WITH E HMS SUSSEXS AND ANOTHER SHIP AND RM THE CAPTAIN THE THE FLOTILLA LEADER WHO WAS ON HMS SLA AND OURSELVES IN CAVALIER WERE ORDERED TO GO WITH THE SUSSIX TO URM A PROBLEM SO WE IMMEDIATELY WENT AT FULL SPEED WE WERE SENT TO TAJAVA WE STOPPED ON ER A COUPLE OF TROOP SHIPS ON THE WAY E CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT BUT WE TOOK ON BOARD OUR FULL DECK WAS COVERED WITH INDIAN TROOPS ARMED INDIAN TROOPS AND THE CAVALIER WAS THE SAME AND THE SESER WAS ALSO AND THE SUSSEX ANCHORED OUTSIDE SURABAY BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GET IN I WE COULD HARDLY GET IN BECAUSE THERE WAS A SUNKEN ER JAPANESE CRUISER IN THERE IN THE WAY SO CESAR WENT IN FIRST BECAUSE SHE WAS FLED TO THE LEADER FULL OF TROOPS WE WENT IN SECONDS AS WE WERE SECOND AND THEN THE CAVALIER AFTERWARDS AS WE WENT IN IT WAS DAYLIGHT WE HAD ALL THES TROOPS ON BOARD SO IF WE'D HAD ANY TROUBLE WE COULDN'T HAVE USED OUR GUNS BECAUSE E LUCKILY WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE FROM THE SHORE BUT UT WE CAME INTO SURABAYA II WAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE AND THERE WAS BODIES DOZENS OF THEM IN WHITE NAVAL UNIFORMS I THINK THEY WERE QUITE PROBABLY DUTCH I DON'T THINK THEY WAS OURS BUT WERE SLOWLY MOVING AVOIDING THIS WRECKAGE AND AVOIDING THE BODIES AND M YOU GOT TO THE STAGE NOW WHEN WE ERE IN THE WAR BODIED IN THE WATER MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU YOU EY ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT THEY WERE BODIES AND DEAD YOU KNOW T SO ANYWAY WE SW SLOWLY MOVED IN WE ANCHORED IN THE
