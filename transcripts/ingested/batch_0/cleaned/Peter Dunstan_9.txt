well of course living in this camp with the guards patrolling around the top all the time there were two incidents there first of all i managed to get into the carpenters shop now the japs in charge of the railway repair workshop which we were there was six hundred of us two hundred british two hundred australian two hundred dutch and mainly indonesian dutch and i managed to get into the carpenters shop the wood shop and the wood shop was controlled by civilian japanese in fact all the workshops this was repair workshop they moved it because it was being bombed by the allies in the other place where it was and we had three civilian japanese in the workshop there was pop who was a wizened old jap and he never understood an never could speak english all he knew was pop was complementary and he treated us well he used to buy bananas and things like that there was moon face who come from osaka description of his face is nothing to be desired and there was sunny boy who when he walked his feet were at ninety degrees i mean he and that and they were civilian japs and they used to treat us well when we were working in the saw mill so that was alright so it wasn't so bad can you remember what you know how you knew that the war was coming to an end the japanese lieutenant i think it was i can't remember now had a radio now the radio had been fixed by japanese technical people and it could only get japanese but after a short time it started to go wrong and the call went out by the japs if anybody knew radio we had an australian who was i mean if you had a technical australian he was a good one better not say anything more about the australians but a call went out to see if anybody would could repair this radio this chap went and volunteered to do it and he found that there was it had been altered by the japs and a piece was missing and he put a call out amongst the british and the australians for certain bits and pieces bits of wire and things like that and he constructed the piece that was missing and went back fitted this piece in tuned it in tuned it in to the allies radio which ever it was i think it was coming from india i'm not sure and cause turned it up and listened to it and then said to this jap officer this ok ooh no no no good no good cause it was speaking in english so cause with that he switched the radio down took this piece out that he'd made put it in his pocket or whatever he was wearing and fixed it back to japanese in such a way about a week later or ten days later it broke down again it used to regularly break down once a week once a fortnight how he did it i just can't tell you and of cause he was called back he used to do the same thing again get a bit more news and we knew that the war was coming to an end we knew the atomic bombs and of course the japs knew this and of course they were a bit frightened and how did you know about the atomic bomb through this chap with the radio you see i mean it broken down the british radio for the forces in india were broadcasting they dropped this atomic bomb and then that atomic bomb you know and so he was getting the information back having tuned the radio in british what's name then used to take his little piece out tuned it back into japanese and a week or a fortnight later it brake down again and he was called back again to do it again so we were kept we knew we knew the war was over now i can't i've got a bit of a blank there i can't exactly remember now all i can remember and knew would never see it but to see a lancaster bomber or a liberator sorry they were liberators in the far east liberator bomber flying along and seeing white puffs come out of the plane and knew that would appreciate of thinking it was engine backfiring engine trouble but then to see these white puffs slowly disintegrate and flutter and flutter down and knew that it was paper well i had a young boy in the workshop with me who lived close by a young thai boy and i said i can remember saying to boon look that paper you bring to me and so we knew when the allies were dropping these papers they were destined for us they knew were the prison camps were and they were dropping these bundles of papers around prison camps hoping that we'd get them and so we knew when the war was over and of course the attitude of the japs completely changed and i was moved back moved back to the the whole camp was moved back to a main base camp which was about four mile away and i fortunately the captain of the marines of the repulse was in that camp so course i being a royal marine i mean i got detailed to be with him and so we knew various things were going on and that can you remember what it was like when you saw that piece of paper when boon brought it back oh yes now what happened to that can't remember now i can't remember now exactly what happened it very likely went for smoking because being close to a civilisation we could get so called japanese not japanese thai tobacco some of the chaps just they'd rather smoke than eat whereas me we were getting paid when we were in the workshop we were getting paid ten cents a day well a bunch of bananas would cost you two dollars from the outside you know thai's bringing in and so we used to keep a thing going like that so you've been liberated what was it like returning to england after all that time and seeing your family well we were flown when we were told to we were taken down to bangkok and again by the japanese the japanese now under allied control and we were taken down to bangkok and billeted in the hanger hanger i think is still i'm not sure last when i first went out it was still there the hanger and the following morning we were detailed off twenty men right your number one group twenty men your number two group twenty men your number three group and at a certain time in the morning there were nothing in half an hour there were twenty it's funny talking to you i can remember these details and yet i can't remember other details there were twenty dakotas landed and you were told right your number so and so get on that plane and we were flown back to rangoon rangoon to i can't remember what it was now it was turned into a british hospital in rangoon and then after a time we were detailed off onto a transport ship and it was worcester the name of the ship was worcester and there was about twenty of us marines including the captain of the marines and one of our lieutenants who'd been gathered together we were taken down to rangoon and put into this army place and we learnt there was a royal marine detachment who had come up the rangoon river and were billeted in rangoon and as soon as we knew this we got a a number of marines i can't tell you how many there was now we commandeered a lorry went down to rangoon and we were welcomed into the royal marine mess and we lived with the royal marines you know they never heard anything about us they were commandos coming in and we lived with them for about a week until we were detailed off to the worcester to come home that must have been amazing to see you know fit young royal marines against yourself who was seven and a half stone ooh yes i mean they absolutely adored us they didn't know who we were but no that was good that we had our own mess deck on the worcester came back to liverpool and we royal marines were taken down to plymouth given ration cards and money and that and given two months leave go home and don't report back for so and so can you remember what it was like going out to your home knocking on the door yes i do actually my father when i when the war came he'd been in the royal engineers in the fourteen eighteen war and had a bit of a rough time and he warned me when i went home and told him i joined the royal marines he said good luck boy when i came home after being a prisoner of war he'd got a big big sheet of something and tied it across the end of the road welcome home i can always remember that but then things happened and i left and that's your military life's story yeah yes well i went back after i went back to the royal marines and due to my war service and that i was destined for what was i oh i was destined in those days of course all royal marines were trained as parachutists and i was told to report to the office one day you will be going to so and so for parachute training and i said no way you will that is an order and i said i won't and i had already learnt as i joined up in nineteen forty there was no war service marines then and course after i'd joined they started recruiting war service marines and i learnt i could transfer so i told the recruiting sergeant what i thought of him when into the office applied for transfer for war service went back to him threw my application on his desk and said here are now you know what you can do and i came out i nearly went back but commando work was not my i was not fit enough and that to do commando work so having gone back to my old company no i didn't i thought as tall as i am once i got fairly fit i wanted to be a policeman so i joined the city of london police and that was a bloody site worse than the marines ever was so after a year directing traffic and that at the bank of england in those days there were seven policeman at the bank of england in london you very likely know the crossroads there there's traffic lights there now there used to be one in the middle and he would direct the other policeman around him to stopping and starting traffic on the different roads so after a year i thought it was a dam site worse than the royal marines so i packed it in and went back into industry do you have any you know overriding what would be your overriding sort of reflection on your world war two experience just one of those things i served my country to the best of my ability i survived as a prisoner of war which was let me to look at life somewhat differently and ok i just carry on i survived end of films
