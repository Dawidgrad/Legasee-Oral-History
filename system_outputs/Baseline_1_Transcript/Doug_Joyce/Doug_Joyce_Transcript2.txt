one thing we haven't clarified here is is what year did you join the london to london a round about must have been about april forty two and and what was the first operational that you operation you did you know well we just we we come out scapa flow light and we kept come into the north sea light and is gunnery practice most of the time but after a while we started going making our way up toward iceland and we was in a of old as the big field it so the convoys are normally assembled in and we stayed there for a while did you get to the american base he was a e oh lovely coca sure they are toffee apple and ice cream we know you're going near a canteen from a great big cornets i got you know we can't get a lolly now one it's a it's were very good light in the american base of us that's a we were i suppose we stopped there then we went out on the convoy i think it was pike fifteen sixteen was already up there but fifteen was so really a gap a gain light and up to then all the convoys that had gone up to me manson archangel then he lost one ship because then the germans be getting hard pushed on a rush on front and they have put a stop to all this stuff going round you know and a tough they really the they didn't attack us so much as as as the merchant ships cause the merchant ships had all the ammunition guns tanks everything aboard him you know and so they intend to sink in them you know as much as they could but when did when you went out on p c fifteen when did you as individually when did you personally start to realize that this was a different experience altogether it's raining role the weather alone it was perishing other you now and course up there you get the summer months you get the daylight all day long pretty i mean at that pace seventeen i can member that winter when they scattered the convoy that night july fourth and twenty five torpedo bombers come out to attack the merchant ships we did you see it yes but they we we was making their way towards the terabits you see what is your job on the un and what you doing when you hold i am when i first went aboard a ship they put me on the a four point seven guns and the warrant officer there cause when when you load these four point seven if you're a miss fire you keep it in the breech for half an hour at least then why well because the pin if that pine jolted it could go off banging any time and has to lower the breach very slowly and the warrant officer always shout for me joyce yes miss was her ready catch it with a sigh and a come as a word you always pick on me is experience inside gives you more sort of more faith in yourself you know a a i done it about a good half a dozen times when yet miss fires now that the the pin goes on the gum but it doesn't pierce enough to set off the shell that's at how they get the misfired then after i went on pump pumps you know latino dinty pump pump shells on them then i didn't go in her after that i just so too i'll be crafty and now go to find a job well i don't have to do shift work like that you know any any rosy old jobs and i saw a job on the board a lieutenant commander newsom requires a cabin hand to is to keep his cabin tidy i thought yes that will do i've don't mind doing a bit of child work and i've done that for quite a while quite a nice man he was his wife was in enso the entertainment thing and that but lieutenant commander knew so he is that he was a gentleman he was when you say the board what do you mean was there a board on the ship was there a sort of condemned notice board on the ship it yes yes yes jobs skin light you know or the world goes around a is a job going sound so right anybody's interested and how did these job scuba when you on ship well you you either finish up scrubbing the deck all the time cause you decks are scrubbed every morning six o'clock in the morning rows has out the matter how cold the weather is scrubbed looming the decks oh i don't go much on that and when it comes to win the first time i went aboard on london we had to the camaflage and what they've done the craft had bites the two blokes who lowering me down i was in one of them little cradles you know they've dropping me three foot a time of course is paint going everywhere there was and a paint all round the anchor and i'll get me home back on a one though you know it's they hoisted me back indoors but you should have seen a stagger me in what was life what was what was your mess like a monsieur what did you just tell me a bit about a london describe it to me what ship herself she was a very powerful ship really i mean she had four or eight eight inch guns a cause the bellas only had six inch guns she up the thames and she she had a inch she had two lots of a barrel pump pumps then they then we had the olicons put aboard the done away where old aircraft which a wool rush used to have a bad day on it the reason being they could only do about eighty miles now if they could do that even and then once you cut a pot them off you then at the wait they come alongside and the crying that they go out and lift them in bold will at a hazard especially with submarines around and they decide a tightly bulrush planes off of all all all ships you know because there too they want machete they want machines that cut a pow off and make their way back to a depot somewhere you know must have been quite spectacular fire are but antantiques they were really you look at it in a plane during eighty miles an hour is nothing even in them days because i mean take the the sea fire and the spit fire because there's sea fires aboard aircraft carriers which is the spitfire in a different version like when i first started to practice him with them the sea fire used to come in and land on the deck of the carriers and go straight over the top strain the august straight and let that find a way to slow him down cause they then they had all his wires with the trailing ok thing on the back you know to to do it larbert never used to watch him you know when we here goes another one a
