away at different places and mother was working she works and doing what was a the mom do at the work with bombs working at ammunition she was working with munitions two younger sisters they were evacuated my older sister so mum was on her own and i knew one day we would all be back together and that's what happened but i never saw never worried at all never worried about anything we'll get through it and that's what everybody thought that's what nobody ever thought of anything different never mind you were all young people that's how young people think don't they what was it like being on the isle of why in the war i mean it must have been quite a dilic spot really wasn't it is it's a lovely place anyway or it was it was beautiful it was it was lovely and it was life a lovely when i work from four to eight in the morning and see the sun rise it was absolutely i've never seen such a beautiful sunrise i used to love it that time of the morning but the people were very very friendly there and and they did they put on doubt there was always dances on during the week and there were lovely walks and things like that and and all the mote most of the places where we lived we all had bikes so that i'd never i'd never ridden a bike before and i always wanted a bike could never afford a bike and i learnt to ride while i was while i was there and we used to go out on the bikes old cycle cycle rides and it was nice but the countryside was beautiful it was lovely and there was also a prison there i think on the isle of white and every so often you know people would say i don't think it was on the radio we were told to did not that the prisoners had escaped everybody was talking about all prisoners of the south don't go out to light this side everything else they were out there it didn't make any difference to us at all it will you know if they're out there they're out there which didn't bother us it didn't stop us god out at all but ever and told to be cared for because the prisoners had escaped but i must say it was it was an island that they never had a chance really they didn't have a chance
