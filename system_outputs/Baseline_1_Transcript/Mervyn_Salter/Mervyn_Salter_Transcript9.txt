did you like this to miss skipper we didn't get to know him too well because he was very detached the only thing to say of it in all honesty was that he was a good good skipper a he got us through these things that man another may not have done and i say he retained a very efficient ship so much so that her allow return to the uk the war over and he's still carrying out night exercises torpedo attacks that sort of thing the hero by ones to keep us on our toes what was his name a manly power admiral manly power he finished up his admiral of the dockyard a duck out at portsmouth and he lived on the isle of wedding just conclude by saying that a sadly my ship was re commissioned in nineteen forty six and was mined in the corfu channel in october well after the end of the last war and there subsequently had to be broken up no of being no further use for service that serve mines laid by the old albanians whether you remember that incident but that was the end of the song rise you went on board no i had left that was in october i left her in february before that did you feel for was you were yes it is a happy ship absolutely yes indeed we are maintained contact with the sub reunions over a number of years but again as one would expect few few and fewer of us left so no more reunions as you reflect on the wall something that must not be forgotten particularly from the angle of the japanese who were carried out some as you probably know some horrific actions the germans were more disciplined and and good seamen but i think that the these things must never be forgotten ah i'll just hate to think what might happen or if anything etatnature turned up in the future
