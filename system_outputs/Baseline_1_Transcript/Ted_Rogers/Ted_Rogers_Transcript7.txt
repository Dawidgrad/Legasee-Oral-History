just in terms of the rescue how does a ship do this rescue what what are you using to help the rescue process well you stop first of all and then you if if necessary you lower your own life boats and go and help people in the water a it 's like we had another lifeboat was lowered up that ship was coming towards us and then you put scramble nets over the side these are big huge nets you don't now reduce a lifting cargo but the young people can climb up them more easily than up a rope ladder and more people can get on them so you can get more people on board and then you you give them whatever you can you know of food clothing whatever the ship we had no doctor on board just had to do what you could you know em but that was just we went official rescue ships we just designated rescue ships if you like the term you know because we had got all of ideo hospital ship for instance when we when we had this sort of area of great scar great sort of intensity the passengers all had to help us while they were on the lookout all these troubled people around the ship as well looking out for super so they didn't get away with it so like the crew they had work to do the all hands on deck one of the rather funny things in the converse was normally when we left england at one particular period of the war we were all given a barrage balloon and it resounded from the mast and then it went up and the ship yet a tally used to come round like the balloon man with all these balloons you see and give you one and go to another time they were small but as balloons you see and the idea was to stop dive bombers you know that sort of come down and least so they are they are about five hundred feet up you know but so when you got into a start a strong wind and win it outside you know they blow away or something like that or become deflated and they went to great success then we had all kinds of later on the were all kinds of weird wonderful rocket things which she went very bad safe but the the ship was armed better against aircraft than against submarines we had halligan guns and one ship a boas and but so fortunately we we we didn't have an air attack on our ship that was always submarines but at one particular period when we were sailing on our own off west africa we saw a cruiser coming up so we put on our top speed which was about fourteen knots and manned the gun you know our gun would have been hopeless anyway and this huge ship came up and of course we couldn't get away from it but it was a free french cruiser and it just circled around us and waved and went off you know but it could have been a german radar that's what we're worried about if i'd been a radio we wouldn't have bit it couldn't have done anything i mean that we had a four point seven a gun with an anti submarine gun tone quite big shell but it wouldn't be any good wouldn't fire very far for a cruiser or a nalanavoship how come you didn't use these four point seven when you had the subs following you and stuff well they were they were mounted on the stern you see not on the bows the americans put some air one some of them had ships guns on the on the prow as well but to be defensive legally it was supposed to be one you'd have a stern so you could defend yourself and not be attacked not used for attacking you see well because we went a warship warships had them for they could use them for attacking but we were not allowed to do it by international law so you had all these subs following you but you were late that we we they were out of range of us we couldn't if we couldn't have shot that far if they come up during the day time as ten of us we could have had a pot shot at but they knew that they couldn't do that and then when they came at night you see as i mentioned before our gun was no use because we couldn't fire across the lines in case we hit the other ship next door to us you see what they are saying that the royal naval officers are gentlemen but not seamen the merchant navy officers are seamen but not gentlemen what about big seas and stuff big storms molavi you ever remember any really horrific ones do you want big swells big storms have they ever caught in any big oh yes i remember one time we were on our own and a for three days we couldn't go ahead the waves were so big we were up and down over them like that and you could see them over the top of the the mast as the ship went down this when you look out the next wave is coming up that way now what you do in those situations is you go dead slow in your engines you ride them if you go full ahead you go right through them and they they swamp you even so you get quite a bit over i mean i know that time we used to carry railway agents on deck sometimes and for west africa and one of our ships same line i was in a storm with one of these on the deck and it broke loose and running up down the deck eighty tons ended up and ended up in the dining room ha ha ha now it was very difficult sometimes because i remember on on one occasion when a storm not as bad as that one but in a storm and we had oil drums on deck and they broke loose they were tired out with wire but they were and were sliding around the deck and it was very dangerous and we had to try and go down and get them into position on the oil the the deck was covered with oil as well is a very difficult job to do that we find a secure it matter it was a result by very easy did you see that the lady on why in durban to see the lady in white the white sheep she came out with her car and durban and sang for us as we entered yes i was very very nice in those days ten was very vague colonial you know that was when we were going to india tell me about that trip that trip well there was interesting because when we left south africa to go across the indian ocean the admiralty asked us to take two of their small white mine sweepers now they were too big to put on the deck a so we had a shepherd them they didn't want to go on their own case they couldn't make it they were wooden mind sweepers so we went like a shepherd with two sheep right across the indian ocean and i remember in calcutta i was in hospital for three days because i got sort of dingy fever though and so that was a sort of hey lights or that and then another occasion in my dress and we took on coal a indian coal because we were a coal band in that particular ship and a and we went out next day at sea it was on fire in the holes in one combat combustion so we had to go back to port and get it all taken out and one very interesting thing was the fire brigade came down and of course it was in colonial times then and the the fire chief fire officer was a white man and he had a beautiful white uniform and gold braid cap you see and he went down into the hole with all his firemen it and thought this fire out you see into the bankers and he fell down one of the shoots they were coal shoots down to the stoke hold you see and he came up on this beautiful white uniform was completely dark and he lost his cap and then when we change changed a few we changed the ones cold we got new cole we went off again and then a couple of days later one of the afi we had african stokers on that ship he appeared on deck with his commodores cap we we had a lot of amusing incidents as well
