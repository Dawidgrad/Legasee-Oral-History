you got to ban pong and you know do you remember what your impressions were what was happening at this point yes yes i got very very close association let me say i am church of england this is about a catholic mission now in ban pong there's a church and today at school where they educate two and a half thousand boys and two and a half thousand girls and when we walked from the trucks we were ordered to get out in ban pong we had to pass this catholic mission just a small church and that and alongside the road there were baskets of fruit and baskets of eats and allsorts and there was a catholic priest in white because we was walking past he was there telling us please you take you take and we walked about half a mile to a compound where we were made to stay as the first part of the prisoner of war now when i first went back having memories of this food and this priest i went back and i found this mission i found actually the priest and he left italy as a boy of seventeen as a missionary priest and he lived there all his life he came to england he was going to italy and he came to england he stayed in this house with me and he was one of the most marvellous people you could ever have he saved a lot a lot of lives with the work that he did with the prisoners of war after we got to this what is it a school it's a buddhist school we were put into this compound and then after so many days which it was in the flood season of the area and i know that the compound was part flooded with water so we were living in water part of the time then the japanese they crowded us into japanese lorries we were one of the fortunate i was one of the fortunate lot we were taken from ban pong to kanchanaburi were the bridge on the river kwai is by japanese lorries albeit we were crowded like sardines in a tin but still we didn't have to walk all the other poor devils had to walk the fifty miles that it is and when did you know what you were sort of doing and what was the sort of day to day work and you know and distance like you just obeyed the japanese because the japanese well it was mainly koreans on that part during the japanese chinese war the japanese had battalions of koreans in china and when the chinese attacked the koreans ran so the japanese never put the koreans into the front line again but they put them in charge of us prisoners of war so the japanese were beating the koreans and the koreans were beating us and some of those koreans after the war they met the hangman from the treatment they gave us but when we got to kanchanaburi again i was one of the fortunate lot we were put on the barges as you say you been to thailand and you seen the river barges that run on the river and we were crowded into those sitting on the top of rice which we finally found out was to be our ration because every night we used they used to stop and unload so many sacks of rice at that camp and so many at the next camp and i think it was about four days we were on the river kwai if you've been there you've been to the river kwai village hotel yes oh well the river kwai village hotel is a beautiful little hotel if you ever go back that is on the river bank and the camp i was in was at the top of the hill where there is a what do you call it when the water bubbles out of the a a spring there's a spring at the top of the hill and that was where our camp was and i drank out of that water and today that water is being ducted down the hillside and if you go to the river kwai village hotel it forms part of a waterfall at the back of the hotel and some of the water is diverted for cooking its good water but that was where we started and we had to start digging and blasting and cutting the rocks for the railway could you remember what you know you talked about some of the koreans met the hangman can you remember some of the mistreatment you got some of the maltreatment that was dished out to you oh god yeah the koreans one particular incident i got up during the night funny how you can remember some of these things i mean the huts we were living in were bamboo palm leaf roofs and where we slept slept was split bamboo platforms about eighteen inches of the ground we had no bedding or anything like that you just slept on the bear bamboo and i got up this night to go to the toilet and this bloody japanese what was it what was he he was the mad mongol mad mongol he was a right so and so big bloke and whenever you passed any of these guards you all had to stop and bow to them and of course i was diving for the toilet and as i came out he caught up with me and bashed me two or three times i never forgot that so and so i know he was one of those that went for the chop after the war but the koreans because they were being beaten by the japanese they took it out on us and there were quite a number of koreans that got exterminated after the war for war crimes did you ever try and escape there was no need there was no possible chance we were in the jungle now there is no food in the jungle there's only wild animals and snakes i mean pythons up to twenty thirty feet long monkeys there was the rations you were given there was no way you could survive you didn't know where you were we knew we were by the river the river kwai that was about as far as we knew where were we we didn't know how far burma was we didn't know how far where the japanese were or anything else there was no way there were two or three that tried to escape they were caught finally by the japanese and executed because they tried to escape the japanese but there was just nothing you could do how did you keep up your morale i can't tell you you just carried on you sort of lived in a twilight world that was it if you could scrounge anything if you could pinch anything you did it not from your mates from the koreans the japanese i mean they were the target in the last camp now this was after the railway was finished and i was for the last year i was down in a railway repair workshop the jap were they jap or korean i think they were japs at this time guards the first thing we had to do was to build a to dig a trench and it was nine feet wide seven feet deep with a slope on the inside and all the soil was piled on the outside so therefore the outside was what ten feet high which was to stop us from escaping
