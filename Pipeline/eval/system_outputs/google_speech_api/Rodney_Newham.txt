that time i wanted to go into the navy but in that time they wouldn't accept you in the engine room artificer if you had glasses because ships in those playing come from the boilers so you never you couldn't do it so i took i went there no sian apprentice it in in in chatham dockyard and five years at the nineteen thirty six in those days when you even when you came here for the children were begging there in bare feet so your sandwiches that you had over and is just a given to the children who were there waiting for the doctor to come out so that i could get you some sandwiches it doesn't seem possible does it but that's true yes i have a sister who are seven years old and i had a brother who is seven years younger and what happened to him i never knew i never knew but my sister she

when i'm late so i never really knew her mother's love and care for now so i can't say that i had a happy childhood of a search now it happened another scare what do you remember of your early apprenticeship in in chatham dockyard you actually of war was it back with you building up for a wall or was it a job for you at the time i went into the apprentice five years apprenticeship so in that time the war broke out thirty nine that's right and so i was serving me a friendship broke out yes well it was when i finished ok i was then a qualified boiler maker which hard job hard work so i had determined that time that i wasn't staying as a boilermaker so i made progress in a tribe and i eventually became an inspector of trades in the dark yeah that's that's what i retired as an inspector i've tried it's the apprenticeship of a boiler michael's a hard job is a heavy heavy material job if you can imagine i won't norton i will what we used to call yarrow cylindrical boilers and made into shape and ninety they were big h upper thirty ton crane just have to lift that yes it'll heavy hard work boiler making was yes i've unknown have a number of people that were killed when one hey head up right just dropped from a crying a slipped slipped out of the and a grip and fell on him and killed him yeah so terrible and then and remember a man bq on the crimes are up and down on rails lifting heavy about lifting under nineteen was crushed up on the line and it was a it was a naval officer who actually went up there at the as you can imagine the steps for a lot so that no other people couldn't get but he went out there to retrieve the bodies autosave he could do anything for the body a very bridesmaid and naval officer left hand of he was a surprise as it was yesterday yes yes under the it was hard obviously chatting became a very very busy dockyard during the war did you notice you'll notice to talk about this escalation in the amount of work in terms of providing for the war effort to come in for damaged because of war and the they would be repaired in it in the end in chatham dockyard handa they're what you start i do make a gun shields and torpedo platforms are the houses on and we used to do that night those platforms torpedo from and things like and gum shields resistor make made over bulletproof metal which was the heart is beating hard and then a number of frigates and the immortan sweepers when i used to do the refits and that would mean stripping out the boiler engine rooms and renewing a lot of the stuff they supply through the times that the engine and boiler runs through a turbo generator it was that collected and distributed it around the yes that was all aluminium trunking with grills on the end of the trunking you could alter the different positions i change my tires grills and fit them and things like that i remember the germans coming who is quieter a number of them i remember the air and the address is a cruiser open open fire i think i think a lot of the aircraft were italians i think that came over because it was noticeable that the germans would have gone on but when the harrison's are open fire on them a lot of these trains changed and turned around and went back from whitley come from is it never believe it would super that's what happened yes the germans would have kept on under that i think some of the answers for italian so yes because where i should have been down in a shower i stood up against one of the workshop and that was my shelter and watch the irish open up on the extras in doc and she opened up not stood there with my back on the wall of the workshop and his name on the strip to the waste fire in the ships and get in the shower empty anime side and unloading again and that was on the irish food yes over i really good though i really can you turn that trains around and experience first i also been down in a shelter didn't even one to go to you went down steps and that was there but i wouldn't go down the thing with me back to the wall of the workshop yes not that i was brave at all it's just that i wouldn't go down the shower time i'd rather take the chance you living in the dockyard as well no i lived outside yes i lived in gillingham rd forty eight i'm near a railway crossing in that part of the other one but i was with my dad i think we knew that we would put it like this with winning the end you know that we would be the victors as a nation because i think everybody will behind the war effort that are yes that i'm i suppose you was used tyres a lot of money and you some people a lot of money because of the war never like that we never made a lot of money because of the war being on and then it was hard work but true great big slab that i'm used to do things on advice a heavy vice one end of it and i used to roll plaits on cylinders out of material and then and disturbed working the furnace and pulled pork rings out of the furnace from round on the up and you just have to have an asbestos sheet to shield yourself from the heat that came off when you pulled it out with rakes onto a slab at furnace and the heat was so great that you used to hold this asbestos streets up in front of the other protect yourself from the heath as you endeavour with large large hammers to escape to make them into the right shape sometimes they were right round and tell you that to her and shape if you just had asbestos sheets check yourself from the heat and the thing was that time you was you who made things out of special shapes and you just saw it up and all of dust would you breathe it all in and no wonder so many men died of asbestosis how i call prague in both lungs which i've got an hour but it never it never solidified menu stop razor and it would go solid in the lungs but i was fortunate in that mind isn't solidify its own it hasn't even up to me to her now course it was fortunate as many many of my colleagues died had had on earlier because of asbestosis yes i remember i were compensated a penny for it and then i've never asked for compensation and i've never her have never worried about it because i have them for years and all these years under there's no effect so it's unfortunate what did you know about the word that you were doing about keeping convoys going and stuff not a lot really know i didn't know a lot we didn't get a lot of information of straight but we read in the papers you know that so we just did a daily work in and we had to join the home guard so very often it was a matter of coming home from work and going out homeguard yes which was in the bt avenue that we had a place it was beattie avenue where we used to sleep at night and then we were a bit cold out they called it a z batteries and they were rockets and you loaded the rockets and fired on at night as to project a load on onto a projector but we said to and you you was giving the elevation and and have a phone and you did that and then i'll give you the word fire and you pulled all these two rockets went out from each other and is about fifty of these as a dead battery lockets on one field i believe the bt avenue if i remember it was firing air craft and you would you hear them could never say that because it was at night and during the day the batteries were man by regular soldiers in her and the home guard would do it at the evenings yeah i never heard of any enough now the taylor through i never heard that we'll actually made it was sung yes i've got a nose two people on each one and you would get the the rocket works in the in the banks of and you withdraw one out all i'm heavy yes at biggest lower heavy too and i think they want tnt and then they were heavy and you run and pick one up and load it onto the rocket and son who is to be to the rocket and you will hear over the phone what the elevation set for rocket to the shower or rocket quite if you like or it and you do that and then you a revised over the phone and then i tried fire and you're pressed down and these two went up and then on the field i must have been a master pin drop to say after all this time the alhambra under under the townspeople used to say i've made a traffic noise when i went off in an hour when i'm all fired at the same time not a lot not a heart i must have been great celebrations yes i can't remember a lot of that it tell you truth
