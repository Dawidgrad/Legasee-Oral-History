I WAS BORN IN LONDON A CITY ROAD HOSPITAL NINETEEN TWENTY SIX AND MY MOTHER TOLD ME THAT THE SNOW WAS UP TO THE WINDOW SILLS I HOPE SHE MEANT THAT THIS WAS ON THE GROUND FLOOR WITHIN A FEW DAYS I WAS A POORLY BABY I WENT DOWN WITH DOUBLE NUMONIA WHICH IS ONE OF THE CHILD KILLERS OF THOSE YEARS AND THEREFORE WAS ON OPEN ORDER OPEN ORDER MEANT THAT EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY TRACKED YOU JUST AS IF YOU WERE STILL ALIVE AND ANY OF YOUR RELATIONS COULD COME IN AT ANY TIME TO A TO SAY MYSELF AND MY MOTHER COUSIN THE A BED BY THE SIDE OF ME WAS STILL GOING ALL RIGHT I WAS BAPTIZED IN THE HOSPITAL CHAPEL AND UNFORTUNATELY I MANAGED TO OVERCOME THAT PROBLEM WHY DID YOU WANT TO JOIN THE NAVY AND WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND I THINK REALLY IN THOSE DAYS AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO UM FOR PEOPLE TO SOLVE IN VISITORS NOW A WAR WAS ON AND WITH PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF AND YOU WANTED TO FIGHT BACK AND IT S LIKE A BURGLAR TRYING TO BREAK INTO YOUR DOOR AND NORMALLY YOU'LL TRY AND STOP HIM AND I WAS DOING A CERTAIN AMOUNT WITH THE A P AND I REALLY WANTED TO GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER SO I THOUGHT ABOUT IT WELL I'LL SHOW TRYING GET A LOT BIT MORE INVOLVED SO I WENT TO THE LOCAL DRILL HALL WHETHER YOU TO TAKE VOLUNTEERS FOR ANY OF THE THREE SERVICES IS THE ONE IN AN EDGE WERE DEANS BROOK ROAD AND VOLUNTEERS FOR THE THE NAVY I CAME ALONG TO PASS SHORT OF TESTS I THINK THERE A LITTLE A FEW WEEKS LATER AND THEY BE THEY ACCEPTED ME AND SAID A LETTER WOULD FOLLOW BUT THEY COULDN'T TAKE ME AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WAS ONLY AM SEVENTEEN THEY HAD TO TAKE ME AT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF PROVIDING THE THE JOB I WAS GOING TO DO IN THE NAVY TOOK ABOUT SIX MONTHS SO I'D BE EIGHTEEN AT THE TIME WHEN I I COULD GO ON BOARD A SHIP SO I WENT I STARTED WORK ON THE MONDAY AFTER THAT I SAID TO THE FOREMAN WELL I'VE JOINED THE NAVY IN AN OH NO NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT WE WANT YOU HERE WE'RE DOING MORE WORK HERE WE CAN STOP YOU AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO JOIN THE NAVY I SAID I'VE MADE UP MY MIND I I'LL JOIN THE NAVY FORGET IT AND AM IS ANOTHER BIT OF LUCK BECAUSE THAT FIRM WOULD WORK IN HUNDRED PER CENT WITH ASBESTOS AND AT THE TIME IT WAS NO PROBLEM BUT OF COURSE YOU'LL FIND OUT LATER ON NEARLY EVERYBODY IN THAT FIRM THAT I KNEW DIED OF ASBESTOSIS SO MUST HAVE BEEN ANOTHER ONE OF MY LUCKY LUCKY TIMES SO ANYWAY FROM THERE THAT ON MY AGE OF SEVENTY AND HALF A LETTER ARRIVED AND REPORT TO THE DRILL HALL WHERE YOU JOINED AND THAT YOU'LL BE TAKEN ON FROM THERE TO AN ACHE MISS ROLL ARTHUR SO JULIA TURNED UP THERE WERE A LITTLE CROWD OF HER AND GOT IN A TRUCK I THINK IT WAS TOOK US TO THE LONDON STATION AND THE LONDON STATION A GROUP OF US WENT UP TO ASCAGONEST AND THERE WE ARE AS A MISERABLE AUTHOR AND THERE WE DID ALL JOIN IN ROUTINE I GET A UNIFORM AND BE TOLD LOTS OF THINGS ABOUT A NAVY LOTS OF HORROR STORIES I'M AFRAID ESPECIALLY TO DO WITH WHAT IS KNOWN NOWADAYS AS A THINGS FUNERAL DISEASE IN THAT DAY WHICH WAS RIFE AND SO I WENT ON FROM THERE AFTER I HAVE PASSED ALL MY USUAL TESTS UP TO GEBUSCOCIA WHERE I WENT THROUGH THE EXAM FOR A TELEGRAPHIST IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR I WENT DOWN FROM THERE TO RELATE AGAIN AND AT THAT TIME D DAY WAS COMING UP AND THEY HAD QUITE ENOUGH TELE TELEGRAPHIC TO FIT WHAT THEY WANTED AS IT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHANGE OVER TO SOMETHING ELSE I SAID WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED SOMETHING ELSE AND A IT'S A YES WELL YOU CAN BECOME AN ABLE SEAMAN AND FROM THERE THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS YOU ARE IN FOR SO I THOUGHT I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT SO ALLOWS A TELEGRAPHIC AM BECAUSE I'LL PASS EXAMS WENT DOWN FROM THERE TO EACH MISS GANGES GANGES WAS TOUGH AND YOU CAN'T SAY THAT HARD ENOUGH IT WAS TOUGH AFTER BEING IN SOMEWHERE LIKE AN ASMISCOCIA WHICH IS QUITE EASY AH YOU LOSE IT WELL BECAUSE YOU HAVE HAD TO BE A NAVAL SEAMAN AND A NAVAL SEAMAN AND WAS WHICH CAN BE AS IT TURNED OUT WAS A TOUGH JOB AND FOR ONE THING BECAUSE THE DAY WAS COMING UP YOU DID TRAIN IN TO TO FIGHT ON THE LAND AS WELL AS FIGHT ON THE SEA SO WE WERE GOING IN FOR BAYONET PRACTICE THROWN OF HAND GRENADES AMONGST ORDINARY SEAMAN SHIP JOBS AND A D DAY HAPPENED WHILE I WAS STILL THERE AND WE COULD HEAR THE FIGHTING GOING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HARRAGE FROM THE DEAD FROM THE LANDINGS AND WE WERE GIVING BLOOD AS MUCH AS WE CAN FOR THE INJURED AND WE'VE TOLD SEVERAL TIMES THAT IF THE FIGHTING GETS ANY WORSE AND IT'S HERIFIC NOW YOU'LL BE OVER THERE JOINING EM WHETHER YOU WHETHER YOU'RE FULLY TRAINED OR NOT SO UNFORTUNATELY THE FIGHTING OR THE INJURIES THINK IT TOUGHER THAN THEY WERE SO PASSED OUT AS A ORDINARY SEAMAN AND THEN AFTER THAT I WAS ASKED IF I WANTED TO DO A WHAT WAS CALLED A SUB RATE THE SUBRATE YOU COULD BE A TACTIC OPERATOR A GUNNER OR YOU COULD BE A TORPEDO MAN WELL AS I WAS ALREADY CARRIED OUT A TRAINING AS A TELEGRAPHIST BEING A RADIO OPERATOR SEEMED ABOUT THE NEXT STEP ANYWAY THAT WAS ANOTHER SHORT COURSE OVER THE ISLE OF MAN THESE STONE FRIGATES THAT THEY'RE ALL STONE FRIGATES ALL THE LAND BASES STONE FRIGATE SO SO FAR I'D NEVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP ONLY LOOKED AT LITTLE WHALERS AND THIS TYPE OF THING WHERE WE DID SAIL AND LEARNT TO SAIL LEARNT TO DO ALL THE KNOTS AND EVERYTHING IN GANGES SO ANYWAY IT BETWEEN THAT WHEN WHEN I HAD FINISHED MY TELEGRAPHS COURSE AND AM THEY SAID TO ME WELL WE'RE NOT SURE WE WHETHER WE WANT ENOUGH TELEGRAPHIC THEY SAID THERE'S LOTS OF OPTIONS SO I SAID WELL CAN I HAVE THE OPTION HE SAID YES WELL ONE NICE JOB THAT'S COMING UP NOWADAYS IS I'M A SIGNALMAN ON LANDING CRAFT I SAID I SAID WELL YOU'VE DONE ALL THE TRAINING AS YOU'D HAVE ONLY HAVE TO LEARN TO BE A SIGNALMAN THROUGH THE FLAG AND SO FORTH BUT I CAME INTO MY HEAD WITH A VISION OF THE LANDING CRAFT AND ME STANDING UP AT THE FRONT THERE FLAG WAVING AND THE GERMANS SHOOTING AT THE FLAG WAVE I SAID NO I'M NO HERO I COME HERE TO DO A JOB I'M NOT HERE I SO ANYWAY SO I FINISHED UP AS A RADAR OPERATOR AND THERE WAS TWO TYPES OF RADAR OPERATORS THERE WAS A RADAR LOT AND THERE WAS RADAR GUNNERY CONTROL ELITE I'D CARRIED OUT GUNNERY IN THE GANGES ON BIG GUNS HAD SIX INCH OF HEAVY GUNS THERE THAT YOU TRAINED ON I OPTED FOR THE RADAR CONTROL GUNNERY SO I DID THAT CAUTION FROM THERE I WENT DOWN TO A CHATHAM WHICH WAS MY BASE ANYWAY I WAS A CHATHAM RATING AND WAITED THERE FOR A SHIP WHILE YOU WAITING FOR THE SHIP ALL YOU DO IS WALK ABOUT THE BARRACKS HAVE JOBS LIKE PAINTING COLD WHITE OR SWEEPING UP ALL DIFFERENT PLACES AND YOU GO DOWN EVERY EVENING IN YOUR OWN TIME TO WHAT I BELIEVE IS CALLED THE OLD BAR BIG BARN AND THEY HAVE LISTS OF THEM PEOPLE TO GO ON DRAUGHT AND FOR A SHIP OR THE FIRST ONE I CAME ACROSS AFTER GOING DOWN THERE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS I HAD MY NAME ON THERE'S QUITE A LOT IN THIS DRAFT SO WE HAD TO GO FOR SOME REASON TO HAVE A MEDICAL EVERYBODY HAD TO PASS THROUGH MEDICAL THAT WAS ON THAT DRAFT WHERE IT WAS WHAT IT WAS FOR THEY NEVER TELL YOU I NEVER TELL YOU IN THE NAVY IS KNOWN AS THE SILENT SERVICE HE NEVER TOLD ANYTHING SO ANY I WENT THROUGH THIS MEDICAL EXAMINATION AS IT CAME TO MY TURN TO SEE THE MEDICAL OFFICER HE SAID OUT WHILE OUT SO I STAND OUT ON ONE SIDE WAIT FOR SOME TIME HE CAME ACROSS AND IS WHAT'S WRONG FELLOW IT YOU SAID YOU GOT GERMAN MEASLES WELL MY GOODNESS GERMAN MEASLES AND YOUR FIGHT IN THE TEN SO I'M NOT HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE NEAR GERMANY HE SAID DON'T BE FUNNY I DOUBT I SPENT A FEW WEEKS IN SICK BAY I'VE GOT NO MEMORY AT ALL OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE I DON'T THINK ANYTHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED BUT IF YOU GO ON THE DRAFT AND GOING ON THE SHIP OBVIOUSLY THE TWO HUNDRED MEN UPWARDS ON THE SHIP PART ON SO FEW WEEKS TIME SO MY NAME WAS ON ANOTHER DRAUGHT AND THIS WAS FOR ACA MISS CARON AND A WERE NOT TOLD WE JUST I'M TOLD WE GOING ON A DRAFT AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DRAFT SO WHEN THE TIME CAME THERE WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED OF US AND FROM CHATHAM WE WERE PUT ON A NAVY TRUCK SO BACK TRAVEL OVER BACK OPEN BACK A CUPBOARD TRUCK TAKEN DOWN TO THE LONDON STATION I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IT WAS NOW BUT ALL OF US PUT ON ONE TRAIN I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY OTHER CASE ANY OTHER PEOPLE ON THAT TRAIN EVERYONE UNDER THE DOORS WERE LOCKED WE WERE LOCKED IN AND YOUNG LAD BAD AS HARD ON HE SAID KNOW WHAT THAT'S FOR DID YOU STOP US GETTING OUT NOVES NOT STOP THE GIRL GET IN TO US WHEN WE GET TO A STATION AT STARTED THE CHAT WE GOT FRIENDLY NONE OF US EVER KNEW EACH OTHER WE WE COME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE OR ANYWAY THAT WAS A LONG TRIP UP TO GLASGOW GLASGOW WE STOPPED QUITE A FEW TIMES AND I THINK FOR AIR RAGE AND FOR NO REASON I BELIEVE WE STOPPED AT CARLYLE AND ON THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED OF THE CARRIAGES LOVELY CUPS OF TEA AND SANDWICHES PASSED ACROSS FROM THE U S OR WHOEVER NOW ANYWAY AFTER A LITTLE REST ON STARTED THE TRAIN AGAIN AS WE DREW OUT THE STATION I REMEMBERED THERE WAS BIG FACTORY BY THE SIDE OF THE STATION RIGHT ON THE TRACK ON AN OLD MILL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND OUT OF THESE WINDOWS THERE WAS BALLOONS AND GIRLS WAVING THE BALLOONS WERE NOT SOME OF THE BLLOONS I CAN REMEMBER I THINK THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OF ANOTHER TYPE WHICH I WON'T MENTION AM AT ANY RATE THAT WAS NICE WE LOVED AT THE FACT OF BEING NO CHEERED ON OUR WAY WE EVENTUALLY ARRIVED IN GLASGOW AND TRAIN CHANGE STRAIGHT WAY OVER TO WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN A LOCAL TRAIN THAT TRAIN TOOK US TO GREENOCK OR GRANNIS WAS OUR DESTINATION AND WE WERE THEN PUT INTO IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE Y M C A A BIG BUILDING AND WE WERE THEN TOLD THAT WE WERE DUE TO HAVE BEEN THE SHIP'S COMPANY OF A BRAND NEW SHIP IT 'S BEEN BUILT IN THE SHIPYARD WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO WHY A BEAVER WAS A REALLY NOW IT WASN'T READY AND WE COULD GO AND LOOK OVER THE SHIP AT ANY TIME WE LIKED A MASS OF WIRES AND AND PEOPLE WELLED IN AND AND I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT WE DID WE MUST HAVE WALKED ABOUT GREENOCK ANYWAY IN A FEW WEEKS THE SHIP WAS READY OLD OLD WIRES AND BITS AND PIECES HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND WE WERE GIVEN OUR PLACES IS ON THE FORD MASTIC WE WERE POINTED OUT WHERE WE HAD OUR LOCKER WHERE WE PUT A NEW CLOTHES WE WERE IN UNIFORM NOW OF COURSE ALL OUR CIVILIAN CLOTHES HAD GONE SO WE JUST HAD OUR OWN NAVAL CLOTHES THE FIRST OF THINGS WE HAD TO DO GO THROUGH TRIALS THE TRIALS WERE TAKEN UP THE CLYDE YOU HAD TO DO THE SPEED WHATEVER DETERMINED AND A FEW GUNNERY TAKE I TRIALS ANYWAY WHEN WHEN WE FINISHED THE TRIALS AND THE SHIP WAS COMMISSIONED THEN INTO THE WORLD NAVY AND THAT WAS THE TIME WE WAS GOING TO BE OFF NONE OF US WOULD EVER WAS TOLD THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO ON A CERTAIN DAY SO IF WE HAPPENED TO BE HAVING SURE LEAVE WE COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY BUT THEN ONE DARK NIGHT SHORTLY AFTER WE FINISHED OUR TRIALS WE SLIPPED FROM THE DOCK DOCKSIDE THE AM OF THE THE YARD THE OTHER YARD AND EDGED OUR WAY UP THROUGH THE CLYDE NO LIGHTS OF COURSE THE CLOSED ALL THE WATER TIGHT DOORS ALL THE SCUTTLES OR THE DEAD LIGHTS AND WE WERE GIVEN OUR POSITIONS THAT WE WERE ON WATCH THEN WE WERE REAL SAILORS THEN SO I WAS STARBOARD WATCH SO THEREFORE I WOULD BE UP ON THE HALF AN HOUR UP ON THE STARBOARD WHAT LOOK OUT WE WE NEVER HAD ANY ACTUAL TRAINING FOR THIS IF WE JUST WERE TOLD TO DO WHAT WE WERE TOLD SO ANYWAY WE EASED OUT OF THE CLYDE YOU HAVE TO GO PAST THE BOOM WHICH LETS YOU OUT THE TIDE SIDE AND I REMEMBER I CAME OFF WATCH I HADN'T GONE ON WATCH I CAN'T REMEMBER THE STAGE BUT I'D HAD REASON TO GO TO THE HEDGE WHICH ARE THE TOILETS I'D SIT DOWN JUST SITTING DOWN AND THERE'S AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION BANG THE DOORS RATTLED PULLED ME CROWDED UP QUICKLY RUSHED OUT OF THE DOOR INTO THE UM WHAT HE CALLED THE CANTEEN FLAT THAT'S JUST A PASSAGEWAY AND BUMPED INTO A ONE OF THE OTHER SAILORS WHOSE OFFICE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERIENCE OF ME AS IF WE'D BEEN TORPEDO ON OUR FIRST NIGHT OUT NOW IT'S ONLY THE TORPEDO AND TRYING TO DISCHARGE IT OUT BUT SHAMEFACED I DIDN'T GO BACK HE SAID WELL YOU WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE THERE ANYWAY SO WE HAD A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT THAT ANYWAY FROM THERE AND I SAY IT WAS A DARK NIGHT WHY WAS IT ALL SO PLAN THIS TIME WHEN YOU LEFT BUT THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THE ENEMY KNEW THAT THERE WAS SHIPS BEING BUILT NEARLY ALL THE TIME AND THEY WOULD COME OUT OF THE CLYDE OR COME OUT OF THE TIME OR PERHAPS COME OUT OF IRELAND AND IF IF YOU CAN VISUALIZE IRELAND AND SCOTLAND AND THERE'S NARROWS IS REALLY WIDE AS A LONG DISTANCE BUT HE NARROWS AS AS A CONTINENT AND THEREFORE SHIPS HAVE TO COME IN AND OUT OF THAT AREA WHILE THIS WAS ALWAYS THE PLACES WHERE YOU'D HAVE TWO OR THREE U BOATS JUST LURKING HOPING FOR A GOOD KILL AND WHETHER THEY EVER FOUND OUT THAT A SHIP FROM ANY SPIES OR ANYTHING WAS COMING OUT AT THAT TIME I'VE NO IDEA BUT THAT WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS PART WERE NONE OF US HAD WORKED TOGETHER WE'D ALL COME OUT OF TRAINING WE HAD HAD GOOD TRAINING IN OUR OWN JOBS BUT OF COURSE NOT TO TAN BECAUSE WE WERE NOT WITH THE SAME PEOPLE WE TRAIN YOU WITH SO FROM THERE ONWARDS AS YOU AT FORD HEBRIDES IT WAS REALLY A TO PUT THE FEW SAILORS THAT EXPERIENCE AND THE OFFICERS OF COURSE WHO WERE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU SEE THAT HAD TO HAVE ALL THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO DO WHAT WE WERE DOING BECAUSE YOU'D GET NO ESCORT YOUR SHIP COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN WITH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CREW THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TO SEA BEFORE NEVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP BEFORE VERY OFTEN SO IF IF WE'D BEEN ATTACKED AT THAT TIME WE WOULD BEEN A SITTING DUCK WHEN WE ARRIVED AT SCAPA FLOW WHICH IS RELATIVELY SAFE WE UM GO THROUGH THE BOOM AGAIN TO GET INTO THE FLOW AND FROM THEN ONWARDS TO DO OUR TRAINING WHAT A TRAINING AT SCAPA FLOW REALLY IS TO GET YOU WORK IN IT AS A TEAM THE WHOLE SHIP HAS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING A GUN CREW FOUR OR FIVE HAS AN HOUR TO WORK TOGETHER IF YOU WERE IN THE M A TRANSMITTING STATION WHICH IS THE ONE OF THE NURSE CENTERS LIKE WE WERE AS GUNNERY CONTROL YOU'D HAVE ABOUT TEN PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM WITH ONLY IN CHARGE OF AN ORDINARY AND SITTING ROOM AND EACH ONE OF THOSE HAD A JOB TO DO BECAUSE ON A DESTROYER WHICH WE WERE AS MISCOMAS A DESTROYER A BRAND NEW RUN AS WELL SO NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND SO WE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE FIRE CONTROL TABLE AS IT WAS WHERE YOU GOT EIGHT PEOPLE ON IT AND ALL THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THEY'RE TRAINED ON SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THE TRAINING THEY STILL HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT IF THE SHIP'S ATTACKED OR IF WE SHOULD ATTACK ANOTHER SHIP SO THAT WAS WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF US IN THE FLOW AT THAT TIME WE WERE SO SHORT OF DESTROYERS IN PARTICULAR AND OTHER ESCORT SHIPS SO NOT ONLY WERE WE STAYING IN A NICE SAFE AREA TO DO OUR TRAINING WE WERE SENT OUT OR IN HARNESS AS IT WAS CALLED WITH ANOTHER SHIP THAT MIGHT BE MORE EXPERIENCED BUT THEN THE CASE OF COURSE THERE'S ONLY ONE OF YOU THAT IS EXPERIENCE AND ONE WHICH IS TRAIN AND RICHES US SO WHEN WE RE LEARNT IT A HARD WAY OF ALL OUR REAL FIGHTING AND WAS AROUND THAT TIME AND AT THE END OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH WAS IN OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER WAS AROUND THAT AREA SO THEY'D SEND US OUT WITH ANOTHER SHIP AND THIS IS IN ONE CASE WE WERE THE ONLY SHIPS THAT WERE IN THE FLOW DESTROYERS AND WE WERE OF COURSE DUE TO DESTROY AN ATHEIST BULLEN WHICH WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AT THAT TIME I WAS A SHIP THAT GOT SUNK SO WE WERE SENT OUT A WE KNOW NOT NO BASIC TRAINING ON THIS WE HAD A CALL TO GO TO A SHIP OFF CAPE WRATH THAT HAD BEEN SUNK WE DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD BEEN TORPEDOED HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY OUR MESSAGE WAS NOT THAT I HAD BEEN SUNK THAT THE SHIP HAD BEEN TORPEDOED AND TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO GO OUT TO TRY AND HELP TO CATCH THE NEW BOAT THAT HAD SUNK IT AND TO PICK UP SURVIVORS IF THERE WERE ANY THERE SO THERE WAS TWO OF US AND IT SEEMED A FROM THE RECORDS I LOOKED UP THE OTHER SHIP THAT WENT OUT WITH US WAS ANOTHER SHIP THAT IS ALSO WORKING OUT SO THESE TWO DESTROYERS WITH ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL AND HAD TO GO OUT TO THE SHIP I FOUND OUT LATER IN LIFE IT WAS AT MISS PULLEN WHICH WAS A ESCORT VESSEL AND THEY'D BEEN LOOKING FOR A ROWBOAT THE VERY NEW BOAT THEY'D BEEN LOOKING FOR HIT ONE OF OUR SHIPS FIRST SO AT MISS PULLEN AND HAD BEEN SUNK AND THE OTHER SHIPS THAT WERE WITH HER WERE STILL LOOKING FOR THE THE EU BOAT WELL THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS A OUR SKIPPER WAS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE VERY EXPERIENCED AND HE WENT TO THE POSITION WHERE YOU BUT WHERE THE U BOAT HAD SUNK AT MISS AND AS SHE WAS PULLING NOBODY WAS TOLD ANYTHING HE KNEW ITS AGE MISS BULL AND NONE OF US WERE TOLD SO THE FIRST THING YOU DO YOU GO ROUND DEPTH YOUR DEP CHARGE IN THE WHOLE OF THE AREA IN CASE THE U BOAT IS STILL THERE WHERE WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH TOLD OUR ASIA OPERATOR THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DOWN THERE WHICH COULD BE THE BOAT SO WE DEPTH CHARGE THAT AREA AND APPARENTLY THE ECHO WE GOT DIDN'T MOVE WHICH STAYED THERE SO WE ASSUMED THAT THAT WAS A U BOAT AND NEVER NEVER CAME UP NEVER GOT ANY OIL NEVER GOT ANYTHING SO AT THAT TIME OF THE WAR THE SNAKE HAD ONLY JUST STARTED SO WHICH HELPED THEM OUT ON IN THE WAR NOW THIS YOU BE IF IT DIDN'T COME UP WITHIN TWELVE HOURS THEN IT WAS A DEAD DUCK SO WE WAITED AROUND THERE ALL NIGHT WITH A BOARDING PARTY READY TO GO ON TO THE BOAT CAUSE IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME UP FOR HER IF IT HAD BEEN AND THEN IT SEEMED WE HAD TO GO ON ANOTHER JOB I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE BUT WE HAD TO GO ON AN ESCORT JOB SO WE STOOD DOWN THE WHOLE TEAM I WAS LOOKING THIS OF THE NEXT MORNING WE STOOD DOWN THE A TEAM OF THE BOARDING PARTY AN ODD LOOKING OVER THE SIDE OF THE SHIP I HAD NO WORK TO DO WAS OFF WATCH AND I COULD SEE IN THE NEAR DISTANCE A MAGNETIC MIND FLOAT PAST BUT NOBODY SHOT AT IT WHICH THEY MIGHT UNUSUALLY JUST IN CASE THERE WAS A NEW BOAT DOWN AND WOULD KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL THERE WE WERE IN SILENT ROUTINE ALL NIGHT YOU NEVER STARTED YOUR ENGINES CAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT NEW BOAT IF IT WAS STILL ALIVE THERE DOWN THERE TO KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL UP THERE WAITING TO IN THE END WE WENT BACK TO SCAPAFLO AND CARRIED ON WITH OUR AND LEARNING TO FIGHT A WAR TELL ME ABOUT CHRISTMAS SAID SCAPE WELL AND THIS WAS THIS THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT WAS THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER OR THE SMALL JOBS WE MIGHT HAVE DONE THERE I'M NOT SURE BUT THE NEXT IMPORTANT THING THAT I CAN REMEMBER IS THAT WE WERE AND NOT REQUIRED FOR WORK AROUND THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD SO WE WERE BACK IN SCAPA FLOW AND IT WAS QUIET AND WE WERE SAFE BUT NONE OF US HAD HAD A CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME BEFORE THIS AND THERE WE ALL WERE IN A DEAD PLACE CAPELLO SCAPA FLOW 'S A TERRIBLE PLACE DEAD AS ANYTHING AND WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS THIS TWO HUNDRED ON THE SHIP ROUGHLY TO UNDO SHIP'S COMPLIMENT AND LUCKILY WE HAVE A FEW AMONGST US THAT WERE EXPERIENCED AND THERE WE WERE THE COOKS AND THE MESS WERE MAKING CHRISTMAS CAKES WITH WHATEVER STUFF WE COULD GET HOLD OF YOU ALSO MANAGED TO GET I 'M NOT SURE WHERE FROM A CHRISTMAS TREE FOR SOMEWHERE AND THAT IS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE MAST ON THE TOP OF EVERY SHIP AT CHRISTMAS TIME OF THEIR OWN HARBOR THEY HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE WHICH IS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE SHIP AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED I THINK BY THE OFFICERS BEING CHRISTMAS BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER WE WERE OR NOT AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE DRINK ON BOARD IT'S A DRY SHIP AT SOME OF THE OLD STAGES HAD SAVED SOME OF THEIR RUM RATION WHICH YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO BECAUSE VERY BAR VERY HIGH CHARGE AS YOU WERE CAUGHT BUT THE OFFICERS NORMALLY ON US ON A SMALL SHIP LIKE A DESTROYER CLOSE HER EYES TO LOTS OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO IF THEY WERE ON A BIG SHIP THAT WE CALL A PASSER SHIP SO MANY OF THE LADS THAT WERE ALLOWED RUM I WASN'T BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO RUN TILL YOU'RE TWENTY AND I WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN AM BUT OUT CAME THE RUM RUSHING HORRIBLE I HATE IT ON AND ON PEOPLE MADE UP THINGS OUT OF PAPER I THINK SOME ARE PACKED IN PAPER RED GREEN AND BLUE CAME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES OUT OF HARDY HOLES AND MADE INTO DECORATIONS AND WE WERE MOORED AT A BOY THERE AT THE TIME AND SINGING CHRISTMAS SONGS AND PUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAD INSTRUMENTS WE HAD A SMALL BAND ON BOARD AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE I SUPPOSE THAT CAME AT SOME OF OUR LADS WHO COME FROM HOMES THAT NEVER HAD IT BAD I THINK IT WAS VERY TEARFUL FOR HIM I CAME FROM A HOME THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY SO CHRISTMAS WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FOR ME SO ANYWAY WE ALL ENJOYED OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME AND IN A PLACE LIKE SKIPPER FLOW SO THAT WAS QUITE GOOD AM COMMANDER WILKINSON WAS OUR OUR CAPTAIN AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A LIFE FOR HIM REALLY AFTER WE'VE BEEN LIVING FOR A TIME CAUSE ALTHOUGH HE WAS VERY STRICT AND HE WAS QUITE HAPPY TO TURN HIS LIFE HE WAS HE WAS A LAD THE SAME OF US AND LATER ON IN THE STORY WHEN WE GOT UP FAR EAST AND I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT BUT HE WE HAD A MULTI POLO TEAMS AND HE WAS ON THE TEAM WITH THE LEDGE AGAINST THE OFFICERS AND THAT WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON HE WOULD BE AND HE WAS I THINK BOXING CHAMPION OF A OF THE FLEET OR PART OF THE FLEET AND YET HE WAS SUCH A NICE PERSON YOU KNOW AND THERE IS ANOTHER CASE I'LL TAKE IT TO LOOK ONE WHEN I GO ASHORE SO AM BUT THE NEXT THING WE WE WENT ON REALLY AFTER CHRISTMAS AFTER CHRISTMAS WAS WHEN WE REALLY STARTED AND LEARNING THAT THERE WAS A WAR ON WE WOULD STILL GO OUT AND WOULD STILL GO OUT AS A SHIP WORKING UP TOGETHER BUT THE FIRST ONE AND WE MET WE WENT OUT WITH I BELIEVE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND THIS WAS TO BE A STRIKE AGAINST NORWAY WE DIDN'T KNOW TILL WE WERE AT SEA THAT WE WERE DOING THIS BUT THERE WAS THESE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS SOME MORE DESTROYERS I THINK AND AM SOME OTHER SHIPS NOW OUR AIR JOB WAS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT THE AM ONE OF THE CARRIERS BUT IT WAS ALSO TO ACT AS A LIFEBOAT REALLY WET WHEN THE AIRCRAFT TOOK OFF AND I THINK A COUPLE OF THESE WERE THE OLD TYPE AIRCRAFT AM I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF BUT THEY WERE BIPLANES NOW THIS WAS A REALLY ROUGH DAY AND THEY TOOK OFF I WATCHED THEM OFTEN ON MUCH ALL THE TIME AND I WATCHED THEM FROM THE DECK AND THE CARRIER WAS BOUNCING UP AND DOWN BUT THEY TOOK OFF AND I THINK THEY CARRIED OUT OR TRIED TO CARRY OUT THEIR TASK BUT THE TWO I SHOW COME BACK DIDN'T MAKE IT BECAUSE THEY THE SHIP WAS DANCING UP AND DOWN THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER DANCING UP AND DOWN AND I BELIEVE ONE OF THEM HIT THE DECK AND WAS PUSHED OVERBOARD THAT'S WITH THE PEOPLE IN IT THEY CAN'T TAKE HIM OUT PUSHED THEM OVER TO MAKE WAY FOR ANOTHER ONE LANDING AND THE OTHER ONE DISAPPEARED I THINK HE WAS GIVEN ORDERS TO TRY AND FLY BACK TO HIS BASE OR A BASE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH TO LAND ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER WE I THINK BEING CRASH BOAT I WAS CALLED WE WENT TO TRY AND FIND THE AIRCRAFT THAT HAD DITCHED SADLY NO AIRCRAFT SO ANYWAY I THINK THEY HAD TO CALL OFF THE STRIKE COULD BE JUST TOO TOO DANGEROUS TO DO ANY MORE THAN FLYING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO THAT WAS REALLY A BAD BEGINNING TO MY WAR WE WENT BACK TO SCARPA YOU TALK ABOUT BEING ROUGH HOW ARE YOU FEELING TERRIBLE I WAS SEASICK MOST TIMES I WENT TO SEE BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU'RE ON WHEN YOU'RE ON THE LOOK OUT OR WHEN YOU'RE IN THE T S WHICH IS IN CAME THE T S IS DOWN BELOW AND THAT IS THE TRANSMITTING STATION THAT TAKES THE THAT'S LIKE A RELAY FROM THE DIRECTOR TOWER WHICH IS RIGHT UP THE TOP OF THE SHIP THROUGH YOU IN A T S TO THE MAIN ARMAMENT WHICH IS FOUR FOUR INCH GUNS SO I WAS THE COMMUNICATION NUMBER SO THE DIRECTOR WOULD SPEAK TO ME THE OFFICER TWO OFFICERS IN THE DIRECTOR WOULD BE SPEAKING TO ME AND I WOULD BE SPEAKING TO THE GUNS BUT APART FROM THAT THE DIRECTOR WOULD HAD INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD SEND SIGNALS DOWN TO OUR BIG COMPUTER THE ORIGINAL A MECHANICAL COMPUTER AND THE MECHANICAL COMPUTER WE'D SEND THAT INFORMATION MECHANICALLY TO THE GUNS AM BUT ONCE I GOT INTO A POSITION WHERE THERE IS EXCITEMENT I FORGOT ALL ABOUT SEA SICKNESS I WAS OKAY SO THAT'S A GOOD THING BUT NORMALLY IF I WASN'T ON ONE MATCH OR SENDING I'D BE STANDING ON THE UPPER DECK WATCHING THE SEA HEAVING UP AND DOWN AND PROBABLY BEING SICK THE ONLY TIME YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS IS WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING ACTION YOU KNOW AM LATER ON WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE MINE LAND WE WERE AT ACTION STATIONS ALL THE TIME BUT IF YOU'RE DOING A JOB JUST ESCORTING THEN YOU'RE AT CRUISING STATIONS AND UNTIL SOME TROUBLE POPS UP DEPTH CHARGE IN U BOATS IS NOT A CASE OF GOING TO ACTION STATIONS IT'S ONLY IF THE U BOAT FIGHTS BACK THEN YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS SO ANYWAY AND WE WENT FROM THERE BACK TO SCAPA FLOW AND I THINK WE DID ONE OR TWO JOURNEYS LIKE THIS AND OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND EVENTUALLY AM WE SUPPOSEDLY FINISHED OUR TRAINING OF WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM MIND YOU ALL THIS TIME I'M A CAR TALKING TO ABOUT NOW WE WERE STILL LEARNING BECAUSE WE WERE STILL TEAMING UP WITH PEOPLE THAT WE NEVER WORKED WITH BEFORE SO IF WE'D RUN INTO ANY REAL TROUBLE AT THAT TIME WE WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD A LOT OF CHANCE IT WASN'T A LATE ON WHEN WE HAD LEARNT THESE THINGS SO AND THE NEXT ONE I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT ONE THIS IS IN ABOUT FEBRUARY I BELIEVE WE WERE JUST TOLD WE WERE GOING OUT I THINK THAT NIGHT AND WE WERE NOT GIVING ANY REAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE WE WERE GOING OR WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO BUT IT WAS A VERY BIG DO THERE WAS A VERY LARGE FORCE AND IT WAS WE LEFT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT I BELIEVE IT IS A FIRST THIS IS OUT A SCAPPER AND THIS IS THIS IS WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE MINE LANE AND OPERATION AM IT IT WAS A VERY IT WAS VERY ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO MOON IT WAS ALL STAR LIGHT SO IT WAS VERY GOOD VISIBILITY AND IT WAS A VERY CALM NIGHT STRANGE ENOUGH HARDLY ANY ROUGH SEA OR ANYTHING AND WE SET OUT AND OF COURSE YOU SELDOM KNOW WHO'S WITH YOU YOU IT'S A SILENT SERVICE YOU'RE NOT TOLD ANYTHING AND WE'D BEEN ABOUT OUT ABOUT AN HOUR I BELIEVE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AND THE SKIPPER THEN SET OVER TO TANO WHAT WE WAS GOING TO DO HE'D OPENED HIS ORDERS AND HE TOLD US THAT WE WE WERE A BIG FORCE ONE OF THE LARGE FORCES WERE GOING DOWN THE SOUTH SOUTHERN PART OF NORWAY TO AGE SAND AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY WE WERE JUST ONE OF TWO SHIPS AND THE OTHER ONE WAS AZALEAS SAME SIDE OF THE SAME DESTROYER AS WE WERE AND OUR MAIN TASK WE WE HAD TO ESCORT THIS A MINE LAYER ATOMIC APOLLO AND FIRST OF ALL BOTH FORCES WORKING TOGETHER HAD TO PASS THROUGH A BIG MINE FIELD THAT THERE'S A BIG MINE FIELD THAT LAY NOTHING BY US AND AND WE HAD TO GO THROUGH ONE PATH FOR IT WHICH WAS THE ONLY PASS THROUGH IT BUT WE KNEW WHERE THE OPENING WAS SO IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE ENOUGH BUT YOU DO GET LOOSE MINES SO OUR AZTEC OPERATOR HAD TO PICK OUT THE MINES THE BOAT AND I WAS ON WATCH AT ONE TIME AND I COULD HEAR HEAR HIM SAYING THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE PORT SIDE AND THE CAPTAIN WOULD MOVE THE SHIP OVER A BIT SO ANYWAY WE GOT THROUGH THE MIND FILL ALL OF US WITH NO REAL PROBLEM AND THEN WE SPLIT UP WE WERE TO WAIT TILL TWELVE O'CLOCK AND AT THAT TIME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE OTHER BIG FORCE WHEN WE WERE BY THE WAY UP NEAR DAVE AT THAT POINT AND THE OTHER BIG FORCE WAS TWO CRUISERS I THINK AND NO AIRCRAFT CARRIES AT THAT POINT AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY A GERMAN CONVOY THAT WAS GOING TO LEAVE AGES AND AND WAS GOING TO HUG THE COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO A STAR STAVANGA WHERE WE WERE BUT WE THE OTHER FORCES TO STOP HIM GETTING THERE SO DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK THE AM THE OTHER FORCE WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE CONVOY AND THEY WERE HOPING IN THAT CASE WHEN THAT STARTED THERE 'D BE LOTS OF FIREWORKS DOWN FURTHER ALONG THE COAST IS QUITE A FEW HUNDRED MILES BUT THAT WOULD TAKE THE HEAT OFF WHAT WE WERE DOING WE WERE A CLANDESTINE OPERATION THE WE WERE TO ESCORT THE APOLLO TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WAS GOING TO START LAYING MINDS DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK AND WE WERE TO BE BETWEEN HER IN AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND IF SHE WAS SIGHTED ON BY THE GERMANS OR PICKED UP BY RADAR BY THE GERMANS AND THEY WERE TO START FIRING WE WERE TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS WE COULD AND TEAR UP AND DOWN THE BIT OF SEA BETWEEN US AND BETWEEN THE APOLLO AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND USE ALL THE GUNS AND FLARES AND EVERYTHING WE COULD TO TAKE THE HEAT OFF HER SO THEY ATTACK US AND SO THE APOLLO AND WOULD HAVE EITHER FLUSHED US OR INDICATED TO US OR NOT ON THE SHORE BECAUSE YOU CAN GIVE EVERYBODY HAD TO KEEP RADIO SILENCE AND WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO SMOKE SHOW ANYTHING WE WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO THE BANG BECAUSE THE NOISE AND WE WERE NOT FAR AWAY FROM THE COAST HERE TWO AND A BUT THE SHIPS BOTH US AND THE OTHER ESCORT DESTROYED AS ELIAS HAD TO KEEP UP AS MUCH STEAM AS WE COULD BECAUSE IF THE FIREWORKS STARTED WE WERE TO HAVE TO AT FULL SPEED RUSH UP AND DOWN THIS BIT OF COAST FIRING WHATEVER WE COULD PREVENT THEM TO THE APOLLO WELL I COULD HEAR FROM THE GUNS CAUSE I WAS IN THE M A T S AND FROM THE DIRECTOR AND BEFORE WE STARTED DOING ANYTHING AND I COULD HEAR THE PEOPLE OF A GUN SAYING WELL I CAN SEE THE HEADLIGHTS THERE THEY'RE JUST JUST OVER THERE A LITTLE BIT A CAR COMING DOWN GOING FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT AND I COULD HEAR ALL THIS AS A HOPE THEY CAN'T SEE US FROM WHERE THEY ARE AND THEN HE SAID RIGHT THEY'VE STARTED DOWN THE OTHER END AND THEY STARTED FIRING DOWN AT THE OTHER END THEY ATTACKED HIS CONVOY AND THEY WERE BEEN YOU CAN SEE WE COULDN'T I COULDN'T SHANE ANYWAY CAUSE IS DOWN IN THE T S BUT IS GETTING ALL THE MESSAGES FROM A NOT THE TWO OFFICERS UP IN THE DIRECT THE TOWER BUT FROM MY MATES ON A GUN BEGUN A GUN AND A GUN THEY ARE FINDING IN ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE WAY SAID LOOK I THINK THAT BLOWS SMOKING OVER THE YOU KNOW ON THAT I REALLY CAN'T SEE US ANYWAY APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO MUCH BUT SO WE WERE SLOWLY CRUISING UP AND DOWN AND THE UM APOLLO STARTED LEARN OUR MINDS DEAD ON TIME DAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK NOW THE THE MINE IS A BIG MINE LAYER THEY'VE CARRIED A LOT OF MINDS A BIG CRUISER THEY ARE AND ONCE THEY START LAYING THE MINE AND THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME IN THEY CAN'T STOP THEY'VE GOT TO DO THE WHOLE OF THEIR MINE LAYING BECAUSE THE MINE FOOL HAS BEEN LAID SO THEY CAN'T TURN BACK THEY CAN ONLY GO ON AND CARRY ON LAYING THEIR MINDS SO ANYWAY WE'RE JUST GOING SLOWLY UP AND DOWN AND AND BECAUSE OUR SHIP WAS KEEPING STEAM UP READY FOR A QUICK DASH UP AND DOWN THE VALVE BLEW SO YOU GOT A NORMAL WHAT IS A WELL KNOWN DESTROYER HOOT WHOOP WHOOP WHOOP WHICH WE DO EVERY TIME WE COME IN AND OUT OF HARBOR JUST TO SIGNAL AND APPARENTLY EVERYBODY WENT MAD THE CRUISES WENT MAD LIVED IN SILENT ROUTINE YOU KNOW AND THEN THE FACT THAT WE WERE NEVER SO STOUT NOT TO THE VERY END AND I THINK IT MIGHT EVEN BE IF ANYBODY HAD HEARD THAT WHOOP WHICH IS A WELL KNOWN BRITISH DESTROYER SIGNALLED TO SAY NO I'M COMING INTO HARBOUR OR SOMEWHERE IF THEY'D THOUGHT NOW CAN'T BE A BRITISH DESTROYER NOT BE IN HIS DAFT ENOUGH TO DO A THING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW SO ANYWAY AND THEY LAID THEY LAID THE MINES AND THEN WE KNEW I DON'T KNOW BAT SIGNAL OR WHAT SHE SAID ALL DONE NOW WE CARRIED OUT OUR MISSION SEE YOU BACK IN PORT AND I WAS AT THAT TIME LISTENING TO SOME OF THE MUD AND THEY WERE SAYING LOOK AT HER MOVE AND SHE WAS DOING FORTY KNOTS SHE'D RUN THE FASTEST SHIPS THEY WERE AND THEY COULD SEE THE BOW WAVE AND IT IS NIGHT BUT AM IT WAS STARLIGHT AND YOU COULD SEE YOU COULD SEE THE SHORE YOU COULD SEE THE PLACE WHERE THE GUNS WERE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A CRACK AT US HAD THEY'D KNOWN AND AM AWAY WENT THE APOLLO AND AM AT SPEED AND WE TURNED ROUND BUT WE WE WENT AS FAR AS WE COULD BUT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO AT A GOOD SPEED BECAUSE WE GOT A SIGNAL THAT THE GERMANS A CAST OUT THAT THEY WERE BEING ATTACKED ESPECIALLY FROM EAGER SAND WITH THE BAT WE HAD ON DOWN NOW AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE AFTERWARDS ON THE APOLLO WHEN I TOOK TOUCH OF THEM THEY SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD AND THEY WERE IN THE MOLESTER TELEGRAPHY OFFICE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT WE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED OR THE FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED COULD HAD PICKED US UP ON RADAR THE FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED AND HE THINKS THAT THE APOLLO WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF COURSE HAD GIVEN THE RIGHT CHALLENGE A ANSWER BUT THEN THEY CHALLENGED AGAIN LATER ON AND DIDN'T CUT THE APOLLO HAD STARTED DISAPPEARING SO THEY SENT TORPEDO BOMBERS AFTER US AND THEY NEVER FOUND US SO WE GOT BACK OKAY SO THE MIND AS SUCCESSFUL OR FORCED DOWN THEM FURTHER INKINKASAND AGES AND HAD STOPPED THE CONVOY GOING UP TO GERM AND THE GERMAN CONVOY THEY HAD SUNK ONE OR TWO OF THE SHIPS AND ONE OR TWO OF OUR SHIPS HAD HAD INJURED PEOPLE BUT THIS WHOLE MISSION WAS SUCCESSFUL IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU ARE EXPENDABLE WHEN YOU ARE OUT THERE HUNG HERE WITH THE APOLLO YOU ARE WHY IS IT LITTLE DESTROYER WITH A VALUABLE BIT OF KIT TALK A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF DESTROYER AND AND IT'S COMFORTABLE YES BECAUSE WHAT WHAT I WHY SHOULD WHAT I SHALL BRING IN IS BECAUSE LATER ON I'M WHERE WHEN TOWARD THE END OF THE WAR WHICH WON'T BE IN THAT ONE IS WHEN WE WERE A BIG FORCE ESCORTING A SOME OF THE CRUISERS OUT TO THE FAR EAST WE ONLY TOOK HIM AS FOR GIBRALTAR YOU SEE AND THEN ANOTHER FORCE TAKES OVER BUT WE WERE ESCORTING A BATTLESHIP THE RENOWN AND WE WERE THE CLOSE ESCORT ONE DESTROYER EACH SIDE FAIRLY CLOSE WHEREAS OTHERS WERE FURTHER OUT AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY LIKE THIS AND I WASN'T ON MY GUEST LEANING OVER THE SIDE BUT WE WERE QUITE CLOSE BECAUSE THE CLOSE ESCORT YOU SEE AND I'M JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE AND OVER THE TANNOY COMES A VOICE FROM THE CAPTAIN WE ARE NOW REACHING A DANGEROUS AREA AND THERE MIGHT BE U BOATS AROUND IF YOU BOAT AS FAR AS A TORPEDO AND THAT IS A PICTURE HOW WE SEE THAT TO TRACK OF THAT TORPEDO HEADING TOWARDS BIG SISTER WHICH THEY CALLED THE RENOWN THEN WE STOP IT YOU KNOW WHAT WE MEAN WE STOP IT AND THERE'S ME LOOKING OVER THE SIDE LOOKING AT THE TORPEDO BULGE ON THE RENOWN AND THINKING YOURSELF YES YOU CAN LOSE TWO HUNDRED MEN JUST A TOP A TORPEDO BENDING LITTLE TORPEDO BULGE YOU KNOW THE SAME A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF A DESTROYER WELL A ROLE THAT MOST DESTROYERS IS THEY'RE FAST AND THEIR MANEUVERABLE AND THEY'RE LIKE A SMALLER VERSION OF A CRUISER THEY HAVE ALL THE GUNNERY BUT SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'VE GOT FOUR BIG GUNS FOUR POINT FIVE BIG GUNS AND OTHER SMALLER GUNS SO THEY GOT ALL THOSE THE ONE THING THEY'VE GOT EXTRA AND APART FROM THE SMALLER SIDE SCALED DOWN THE BIG SHIPS HAVE NOT GOT ANTI SUBMARINE EQUIPMENT THEY'VE GOT TORPEDOES AND THINGS BUT UNLESS THEY'RE SUBMARINE ON THE SURFACE THEY GOT NO DEATH CHARGES SO AM A DESTROYER HAS STEP CHARGES SO WE WERE THERE TOO BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIFFERENCE THE REASON WHY YOU GOT THE DESTROYER AS WELL IS JUST AS I SAID IF THE CAPITAL SHIP OR WHATEVER IS YOUR GARDEN IS TORPEDOED THE LAST RESULT IS YOU GETTING THE WAY OF THE TORPEDO HE 'D RATHER LOSE A SHIP THAT'S ONLY GOT TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED MEN ON BOARD THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MEN ON THE BATTLESHIP REMOTE AS IT MIGHT BE IF IT'S GOT A TORPEDO BULGE AND THIS IS WHY WE SHOW A TOOL OF SHORT OF DESTROYERS BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM GET LOST BECAUSE THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN A TORPEDO IS SIGHTED IS TO GO TO ATTACK THE SUBMARINE THAT FIRED IT BUT YOU SHOULD BE NEAR ENOUGH TO GET IN A WAY OF THE TORPEDO IF IT HAPPENS TO BE HEADING YOUR WAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALKED A BIT ABOUT HOW YOUR WORDS IT SEEMS YOU WERE VERY YOUNG THROUGH IS THERE A MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE ON BOARD WHERE YOU THOUGHT WERE WORKING BRILLIANT YOU KNOW I'M WELL NOT REALLY YOU JUST SAW FIT IN AND PART OF LIFE IS YOU YOU MANAGE TO FIT INTO EVERY SITUATION IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH AND AND YOU ALTHOUGH I NEVER WORRIED AND YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD SWIMMER YOU MUST BE A WAY EVEN IF THE SHIP SINKS BUT THEN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU SPEAK TO OTHER PEOPLE YOU'VE GOT SEA BOOTS ON AT THE TIME YOU HAVE A A BELT WHICH SHOULD SHAVE YOU WHICH YOU WEAR ALL THE TIME AT SEA BUT YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT BELT BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT GETS IN THE WAY OF YOUR ARMS AND EVERYTHING SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU HAVE TO JUMP INTO THE HOGGING AS THEY CALL IT THE SEA THAT BELT MUSTN'T BE BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT MIGHT BREAK YOUR ARMS SO YOU'RE EXPECTED TO BLOW THAT UP WHEN YOU HIT THE SEA AND I CAN'T SEE YOU GET LUCKY I NEVER HAD TO BUT I HAVE THE SURVIVORS THAT HAVE TOLD ME YES I HAD TO BLOW IT UP AS SOON AS I HIT THE WATER AND I HAD NO BREATH AT ALL LEFT I COULDN'T BLOW IT UP BUT THE SEA BOATS DRAG YOU DOWN BECAUSE THE THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE WEARING THIS IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG EVENT THAT YOU RECALL HIM I'M WHETHER IT WAS REALLY MUNDANE MOST OF THE THINGS EVER EVEN AS ESCORT TO THE MONSTERS THAT WE DID YOUR ENEMY IN MOST CASES WAS A SEA WE GOT BATTERED LEFT RIGHT AND CENTER TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE QUEEN MARY AND QUEEN ELIZABETH BECAUSE AS WE TOOK THEM OUT OF THE CLYDE WE ZIGJAGGED ALL THE WAY WITH THEM AND WE KEPT UP WITH THEM TILL THEY REACHED THEIR TOP SPEED WHICH WAS THE DISTANT ABOUT FURTHER THE WAY ACROSS AND THEN WE LEFT THEM AND WE EITHER WAITED AROUND FOR THE NEXT ONE COMING IN FOR INSTANCE WE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE QUEEN MARY OUT AND WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO WAIT JUST A FEW HOURS FOR THE QUEEN ELIZABETH TO COME IN AND ALL THE TIME ONE OF YOU MIGHT PICK UP ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU AT THE QUEEN MARY WOULD HAVE ITS OWN AZTEC BESIDES ITS OWN RODALE AND WE OF COURSE WERE AT THE AZTEC AND THE RADAR AND OUR COHORT PERHAPS A CAVALIER WOULD BE THE SAME WELL WHEN WE'D STEAM OUT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE A PART AT THE EXTREMES OF YOUR ACASTIC CIRCLE AND YOU RADAR CIRCLE SO YOU DIDN'T INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHER'S RECEIPT OF THE WAVE AND IF WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SUBMARINE MIGHT HAD BEEN A WRECK WILL IMMEDIATELY WE'D RUN UP A BLACK FLAG ON OUR FLAG DECK SO THE QUEEN MARY WOULD KNOW AND THEY'LL SHOW THE CAVALIER WOULD KNOW THAT WE'VE PICKED UP AN ECHO IMMEDIATELY WE'D HIVE OFF TO ATTACK THE ECHO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE IN TROUBLE IF IT IS IF THAT'S A U BOAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ALREADY FIRED ITS TORPEDO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU TURN OFF SWIFTLY AT FULL SPEED IF YOU CAN IF YOU GOT A BEAM SEE IF YOU CAN TURN OFF LEFT OR RIGHT YOU HIT WITH A BEAM SEE THE DESTROY GOT HARDLY ANY DRAUGHT YOU'LL TURN OVER STRAIGHT AWAY SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY WICKED WE NEVER DID WHENEVER IT'S LUCK ORDERS BY JUDGMENT I DON'T KNOW BUT ANY RATE THEN IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HIT BY A TORPEDO THEN YOU'D FIND YOUR WAY TO WHEREVER THE ECHO WAS AND YOU WOULD ATTACK THE ECHO SO YOU'D LOOSE OFF ABOUT TWO DEAF CHARGES FROM ONE SIDE TO FROM THE OTHER AND ROLL OFF OF THE TWO WRECKS FROM THE REAR SO AS TO PATENT ABOUT TEN CHARGES WELL IF THE EU BOW IS A VERY EXPERIENCED ONE AND HE WAS WATCHING YOU ON THE PERISCOPE HE WOULDN'T BE THERE WHEN YOU ARRIVED HE WOULD EITHER HAVE GONE DOWN LOW OR HE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BUT AT LEAST YOU KEPT HIM DOWN THERE'S NO CHANCE OF HIM HITTING YOUR CHARGE AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO TRY TO CATCH IT UP TAKES ABOUT HALF A DAY BECAUSE THE THEY'RE KEEPING THE SAME SPEED EVEN IF THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO LEAVE THE QUEEN MARY OR TO QUEEN ELIZABETH THE QUEEN MARY WOULD CARRY ON IT WOULDN'T STOP AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY'D ACTUALLY TORPEDO TO QUEEN MARY THEN HE WOULD HAVE LOST A LOT OF LIVES BECAUSE WHILE YOU'RE THE QUEEN MARY IF IT'S COMING BACK IN YOU'LL HAVE A FULL COMPLIMENT OF AMERICAN JEWS AND THAT WOULD BE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND IT WOULD BE CARRYING NOW THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TIGHTEN UP THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING FROM THE DIFFERENT DECKS ALL THE TIME IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF WE GO INTO ACTING STATIONS THEN WE CLOSE OUR WATER TIGHT DOORS WHICH MEANS IF YOUR TORPEDO OR MIND IT WILL ONLY DAMAGE THE COMPARTMENT WHERE YOU'RE WITHIN SO THE SHIP MOST LIKELY WON'T SINK BUT IF IT'S ON THE QUEEN MARY DIDN'T HAVE GOT NO CHANCE OF ANY OF THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BEING CLOSED BECAUSE THEY ARE TRAVELLING BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT EVEN DECKS THEY ARE PERHAPS SLEEPING ON ONE DECK TRAVELLING UP THE NEXT DECK TO EAT FOOD ANOTHER DECK FOR EXERCISE ON THE TOP DECK IS ALWAYS EXERCISE CUDDY COULDN'T HAVE CLOSED HER CREW WOULD FIGHT DOORS SO ANY OF THOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISASTERS WE WOULD FIND WHAT WAS IT LIKE SEEING THE SHIP WAS THE QUEEN MARY THE QUEEN ELIZABETH THE SAILING ON DID YOU HAVE ANY FRIDAY WITH ANY BITE SHIPS THAT YOU KNEW OF AND WERE PROUD OF ANYWHERE WELL AND ALL ALL WE REALLY KNEW WAS THAT WE WAS GOING TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS OR BRING ONE THE MONSTERS IN OR IF IT WAS THE QUEEN MARY AND WE WERE IN GREENOCK THEN WE WOULD KNOW IS THE GREEN THE COIN WHERE WE WERE TAKEN OUT AND THAT'S ALWAYS GOT THREE FUNNELS ANYWAY IF WE PICKED UP IF HE'S GOT THREE FUNNELS ITS QUEEN MARY 'S GOT TWO FUNNELS IT'S QUEEN ELIZABETH AND SO ON YOU FOR A FOUR FUNNELS WITH THE AQUITANIA AND SO IT WENT ON BUT YOU WERE NEVER TOLD YOU WERE JUST SAIL OUT AND GO TO A RENDEZVOUS WHERE YOU'D WAIT AROUND OR YOU'VE ALREADY CONTACTED THAT SHIP TO SAY YOU'RE THERE AND YOU'D BRING IT IN VERY OFTEN EVEN WE TWO ESCORTS ONE WOULD BE AT GREENOCK AT THE CLYDE AND THE OTHER BE DOWN AT LIVERPOOL AND WE WOULD REACH A POINT OF RENDEZVOUS GOING OUT OF THE CLYDE AND THE OTHER ONE THE CAVALIER PERHAPS COME OUT AT LIVERPOOL AND THEN WE'D STEAM UP TOGETHER TO THE M A RENDEZVOUS POINT FOR THE THE MONSTER DID THIS HAPPENED ALMOST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK FOR A MAN OR OTHERS WE NEVER HAD THE SAME COHORT AND BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T ALWAYS BE IN THE SAME AREA THEY'D BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE AND BETWEEN THAT IF YOUR DUTY SHIP IF THERE WAS AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER WHICH HAPPENED IN ONE CASE A HAD BEEN TORPEDOED WE HAD JUST COME DOWN FROM SCAPE TO A TO GREENOCK AND WE HAD JUST ARRIVED AT THE HARBOUR ENTRANCE WE WENT STRAIGHT TO AN OILER BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO FILL UP WITH OIL BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO OUT AND JUST AS WE ARE AT THE OILER WE GOT AN EMERGENCY CALL TO SAY THAT SOME AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER HAD BEEN TORPEDO JUST OUT IN THE CLYDE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CLYDE SO WE JUST LET GO FROM THE OILER AND WE WENT STRAIGHT OUT TO A TO THE THE THING IT WAS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND STRANGELY ENOUGH SHE WAS ON HER OWN SHE HAD COME FROM LONDERY SHE HAD NO ESCORT AND LUCKILY SHE DIDN'T HAVE A FULL COMPLIMENT OF A OF SEAMEN AND SO FORTH AND SHE WAS COME INTO A TO THE CLYDE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY TORPEDO THAT THE TORPEDOED AND A MERCHANT SHIP AT THE SAME TIME AND THE NEW BOAT GOT AWAY ALTHOUGH WE WENT TO ATTACK IT IT WAS DARK AND WE LEFT THE OTHERS I THINK LOOKING FOR THE NEW BOAT AFTERWARDS WHERE WE CAME CAME BACK INTO HARBOUR HOW LONG ARE YOU AT SEA WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN THE ATLANTIC HOW OFTEN YOU GOING BACK TO BASE AND GETTING IT LAND LEFT IN A DESTROY NOT VERY LONG BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT MUCH FUEL AND THE WAYS USING YOUR TOP SPEED ALWAYS MANEUVERING YOUR ONLY WAY OF GETTING FUEL IF YOU'RE OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS FOR FROM ONE OF THE BIGGER SHIPS EITHER FROM AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER OR SOMETHING AS BIG AS A BELFAST A CRUISER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ALSO FOOD YOUR FOOD RUNS OUT AFTER A SHORT WHILE SO THE ONLY TIME WE'RE REALLY OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS WHEN WE UP AT SCAPA WHEN I AM WORKING UP WHEN WE'RE GOING OUT ON THEM FOR AS TO HELP TO SINK THE TIP TURPETS OR DOING OTHER JOBS MOST OF THE OTHERS IT WAS A CASE OF GOING OUT JUST FOR A DAY OR TWO TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS AND THEN COME BACK WITH THE MONSTER OR TAKE ONE OUT AND LEAVE IT IN WHICH CASE WE'D HAVE TO GO TO LONDON DERRY PERHAPS AND THEN WE COME OUT OF LONDON DERRY AGAIN AND NOT GO OUT ON THAT SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT RESPECT THAT NO WE WERE NOT OUT FOR VERY LONG THERE IS ONLY ON ONE OCCASION WHEN WE WAS OUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME IT MUST HAVE BEEN OVER TO FIVE DAYS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE OCCASION WAS BUT WE HAD RUN OUT OF FOOD AND WE WAS FURTHER UP IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND OUR CAPTAIN WAS A EX FISHERY FLEET MAN HE HAD HIS OWN FISHERY FLEET THEN SO WHAT HE DECIDED TO DO AS WE RUN OUT OF FOOD HE SAID I KNOW WHERE THE FISH ARE SO HE GUIDED THE SHIP UP TO WHERE HE KNEW THEY WERE PICKED UP A SHOVEL ON THE RADAR ON THE AZTEC DROPPED AT A TEPID LOWERED THE BOAT PICKED UP ALL THE FISH THAT CAME UP THE STUNNED HE STOOD ON THE FOLK SO WE SAW HIM SETTLE IN THE FOLKS AND SAID UP MY MIND PICKED THE PAGES ONE WE LIVED ON FISH FOR A FEW MORE DAYS AFTER THAT TO ONE VERY GOOD BUT OUR RUNS WERE MOSTLY AND JUST ABOUT FIVE DAYS AT A TIME BUT THAT MEANT THAT EVERY TIME WE CAME IN TO THE ER EITHER CAPPER OR IF WE WERE IN LIVERPOOL OR TO THE DECIDE WE HAD TO ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF FUEL ON BOARD BECAUSE IF YOU'RE DEFOE A DUTY DESTROYER AND THEN IF SOMETHING COMES UP WHERE SHIP'S BEEN SUNK YOU HAVE TO GO OUT STRAIGHT AWAY AND YOU MIGHT BE OUT FOR A LONG TIME LOOKING FOR A SUBMARINE OR MORE ON SUBMARINE SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THE FACT THAT WE NEVER WENT OUT FOR A LONG TIME OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL IN AT SEA WHICH IS A DANGEROUS PRACTICE ANYWAY AND PICKING UP FOOD AND EVERYTHING FRONT FROM IT CAN YOU DESCRIBE RAGE YES AND IS THE JOB WITH RED IT YES VERY YOU DO BUT FIRST OF ALL WHEN I WAS ON THE RADAR SET IT'S ONLY A SMALL SET AND A IT THEY'RE DIFFERENT TYPES AT THE TWO NINE THREE THAT IS HIGH UP ON THE MASS AND ITS SPECIALLY FOR PICKING UP AN AIRCRAFT OR SURFACE SHIPS REALLY ANY ANY DISTANCE I CAN CAN'T THINK OF THE RAT RANGE RANGE OF IT BUT IT SENDS OUT A SIGNAL FROM THERE WHICH OF COURSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT ANYTHING YOU DON'T GET IT BACK BUT IF IT HITS ANYTHING EVEN CLIFFS OR AN AIRCRAFT OR A SURFACE SHIP THEN IT BALANCES BACK AND ON THE SCREEN I AM WHICH IS A ROUND SCREEN UNDER THE THE CURSOR IS GOING ROUND ALL THE TIME THAT WILL SHOW A BLIP AND THAT BLIP YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S ON A CLOUD WHICH IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE IT DEPENDS ON YOUR RADAR WHAT IT'S DOING A VERTICAL OR ANGULAR AND YOU WILL THEN READ OFF THE DISTANCE AND THE ANGLE OF EVERYTHING IF THIS IS MOSTLY ON ON A LEVEL BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER SCREAM WHICH GIVES YOU THE HEIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT SO YOU USE ONE WITH THE OTHER THAT THAT AND WHEN THAT SIGNAL ELECTRONIC SIGNAL HITS ANYTHING THEN IT RETURNS AND THEN YOU YOU READ OFF THE DISTANCE OF IT BUT AS IT'S NOT IT'S EASIER TO USE AND WHERE WE FIND A DIFFICULTY IS BY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT EITHER LAND BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF IT ON THERE OR IF IT'S A SMALL BLIP THEN IT IS AN AIRCRAFT A SHIP OR WHATEVER IF IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE USING ONE TYPE OF RADAR IT'S ONLY A ONLY HORIZONTAL IF YOU USE ANOTHER ONE IT CAN BE HORIZONTAL OR AN AIRCRAFT AND IT WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD DISTANCE THE TIME IT TAKES OF COURSE IT'S BASED ON IF IT TAKES TEN SECONDS TO GET FROM THERE TO THERE THEN THIS AND YOU READ IT OFF FROM THE QUEEN LUCKILY AT OUR POINT IN THE WAR WE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH AIRCRAFT THE ONLY TIME WE WOULD HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THAT IS IF THE TORPEDO BOMBERS HAD BEEN SENT AFTER US OFF NORWAY THEN WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO USE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD KNOW THE THE AIM WE'D HAVE TO USE THE TWO RADAR SETS THEN THE ONE THAT GIVES YOU A SIGNAL IN THE HEIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT AND THE OTHER ONE WHICH GIVES YOU A DISTANCE OF IT AND THEN YOU'RE TRAINED TO KNOW WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT AS FAR AS I REMEMBER IF IT WAS ONE OF OUR OWN AIRCRAFT IT WOULD HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION SIGNAL WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW ON YOUR RADAR SET BEFORE IT GOT TO YOU SO YOU YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE PRETTY WELL EXPERIENCED BUT MY TIME WAS NOT ALWAYS ON A RADAR SET YOU WERE SOMETIMES ON LOOK OUT AS A SEAMAN WHERE YOU'RE SITTING UP IN A LOOKOUT BOX ON THE STARBOARD SIDE WAS MINE AND YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR AIRCRAFT WHICH WAS NOT VERY OFTEN BEFORE A SURFACE SHIPS OR MORE THAN LIKELY YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR A LITTLE TINY PERISCOPE WHICH IS VERY HARD TO SEE IN A ROUGHER ATLANTIC OR YOU MIGHT BE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE THE TRACK OF A TORPEDO COMING TOWARD YOU IN WHICH CASE YOU GET INTO A PANIC AND A CALL OUT QUICKLY TO THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE AND THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE AND THE CAPTAIN OR AN OFFICER OR THE OF THE WATCH AT THE TIME IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE NOWADAYS IT'S ENCLOSED BUT IS AN OPEN BRIDGE SO THE BRIDGE IS HERE YOU GOT A LOOKOUT POSITION JUST HERE SO YOU JUST CALL OUT TO THAT PERSON ON THE BRIDGE OFFICER SHIP BEARING RED FIVE O GREEN FIVE WHEREVER YOUR POSITION IS ANGLE OF SIGHT IF IT'S AN AIRCRAFT AND YOU'D IMMEDIATELY A LOOK AT IT AND DECIDE WHAT ACTION TO TAKE BUT IF YOU'RE IN THAT LOOK OUT POSITION WHICH I WAS ON QUITE A LOT AS A SEAMAN IT'S ROUGH CAUSE AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN ALL THE TIME BEING A DESTROYER YOU ALMOST A SUBMARINE AT TIMES THE WHOLE OF THE SEA COMES UP OVER YOU AND YOU GET KNOCKED BACK AGAINST THE SEARCHLIGHT AND IT IS VERY DAMP THAT IS VERY ROUGH UNCOMFORTABLE BUT AND THIS IS WHAT YOU GET USED TO YOU USED TO WEAR AN ESPECIAL SUIT WHICH COVERS YOU COMPLETELY WATER FOR SUIT WITH CAPE UP WARNING AND BUT EVEN EVEN THAT THE WATER GOT ALL THE WAY DOWN AND YOU GOT SOAKING WET I REMEMBER COMING OFF WATCH ON ONE OCCASION LIKE THIS CAUSE NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO CLIMB BACK DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE LADDERS OF THE SHIP BECAUSE THE THE DOORS THAT YOU WOULD GO IN AND OUT IN PORT WERE OPEN WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA THOSE DOORS WILL BE CLOSED BECAUSE THE WATER COMES IN THOSE SO YOU HAVE TO CLIMB DOWN LADDERS DOWN THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP NOT NOT OUTSIDE IN THE SEA BUT CLIMB DOWN FROM THE TOP DECK TO THE VERDICT AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL THE WAVE IN IT HITS YOU YOU CAN GET WASHED AWAY SO HOLD ON VERY TIGHT WELL THIS WAS THE MIDDLE WATCH THAT I CAN RECALL WHICH IS FROM TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MAN FOR TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BUT YOU'RE NOT ON WATCH LOOK OUT ALL THAT TIME OF THE FOUR HOUR WATCH YOU DO DIFFERENT JOBS HALF ON ON LOOKOUT HALF HOUR PERHAPS ON THE ROAD OR SET OF OUR ONE HALF HOUR BEHIND A GUN WHERE THERE'S A GOT YOU BECOME PART OF THE GUN CREW SO IF YOU DID HAVE TO GO INTO ACTION YOU WOULD DO THE SHOOTING WHILE THE REAL GUN CREW IS CALLED UP TO TAKE OVER FROM YOU WELL ON THIS OCCASION IT HAD BEEN VERY WET OUTSIDE I'D GOT SO THIN AND TIRED I SAY MIDDLE WATCH PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK I'D COME DOWN SO WENT DOWN TO MY MESS DECK WHICH IS IN THE FOLKS IT'S A ROUGH PART OF THE SHIP I HADN'T SLUNG MY HAMMOCK I SLEPT ON THE CUSHIONS AND THIS TIME I I DIDN'T FANCY IT SLEEPING ON THE CUSHIONS CAUSE THE SHIP WAS GOING SO MUCH THIS WAY AND I KNEW I'D COME OFF THE CUSHIONS SO I GOT DOWN UNDER THE MESS TABLE THERE'S ABOUT THAT MUCH WATER ON THE FLOOR THE DECK SORRY NOT THE FLOOR ON THE DECK ABOUT THAT MUCH SO I GOT MY COAT ON MADE THIS SUIT SUIT AS YOU CALLED IT AND EVERYTHING AND I'M LAYING DOWN NOW OFF TO SLEEP STRAIGHT AWAY AND NEXT THING I KNOW A FOOT HAD TOUCH ME AND I OPENED MY BLEARY EYES AND THERE WAS THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH AND THE LEADING SEAMAN OF THE MESS AND HE WAS SAYING TO ME I'M TOLD THIS IN THE MORNING BY THE LEADING HAND OF THE MESS HE SAID THE OFFICER SAID TO YOU COME ON SEMEN YOU CAN'T SLEEP UNDER THERE IS TOO WET AND I SAID AND HE LOOKED AT THE LEADING HAND AND SAID WHAT DID HE SAY AND THE NAMES TO KNOW I DON'T READ THAT LANGUAGE AND SO OH WELL WE'D BETTER LET LET HIM SLEEP THERE AND HE LEFT ME THERE NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT IT THOUGH WELL YOU YOU'RE LYING IN THAT MUCH WATER THE THE DECKS OF THE SHIPS WERE INSIDE NOW INSIDE YOUR MESS DECK THE WATER JUST IT'S A ONE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE AND A LITTLE BIT WARMER INSIDE SO YOU GET ALL HUMIDITY ALL THE WATER RUNS DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE DECKS ANY TIME YOU'RE ON THE CAVALIER YOU YOU HAVE A LOOK INSIDE BECAUSE YOUR METAL WORK AT THE SHIP'S SIDE IS ONLY ABOUT EIGHTH OF AN INCH NO THICKER THAN THAT AND AM SO THERE THERE WAS YOU GOT WATER MOST THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE ON THE ON THE MESS DECKS WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA AND YOU'RE IN HARBOR YOU'RE NOT TOO BAD SO IT GETS A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE THERE WAS ANOTHER TIME WHEN WE WORKED WITH THE QUEEN MARY AND WE HAD TO PICK HER UP TO BRING HER IN WE WENT OUT AND IT'S IN ON ONE OF THE ROUGHEST STORMS THAT WE HAD ABOUT THREE REALLY ROUGH STORMS IN THE PERIOD THAT WE WERE WORKING IN THE ATLANTIC AND WHAT WE HAD TO AT THIS TIME HAD BEEN ABOUT MARCH NINETY FORTY FIVE WE HAD TO GO AND PICK UP THE QUEEN MARY NOW THAT THE STORM HAD BEEN RAGING ALL THE WAY FROM AMERICA AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE THAT THE BIG STORM THAT COME ACROSS OUR WAY AND THE QUEEN MARY BROUGHT IT WITH A SORT OF THING AND WE PICKED HER UP AND I THINK WE WERE A DAY OR MORE WAITING TO PICK HER UP BECAUSE EVEN SHE HAD BEEN HELD UP BY THE BAD STORMS WELL WE AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAS THE SISTER SHIP AT THAT TIME BUT WE GOT REALLY BENT UP WE LOST ON A MOTOR BOAT WE LOST ONE OF THE WHALERS A AND WE GOT REALLY KNOCKED ABOUT AND WHEN WE GOT TOWARDS THE CLYDE THE QUEEN TO QUEEN MARY KNOWING THAT IT WAS IN THE AREA THAT THERE WOULD BE YOU BOATS WE HAD TO RELY ON HER SPEECH THAT COULD BE SO AS AS WE GOT WITHIN HAILING DISTANCE I SUPPOSE YOU SAY OF THE OF THE CLYDE AND THE QUEEN MARY DECIDED SHE COULDN'T SLOW DOWN TO KEEP UP WITH US BECAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH FOR US WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER AND SO SHE JUST FLASHED THE MESSAGE SHE IN THE CLOUD TATA AND SHE KEPT UP HER SPEED AND GOT INTO THE GLIDE NOW SHE HAD THE WHOLE OF THE FRONT OF HER BRIDGE STOVE IN AND HE'S A BIG SHIP WELL UP IN THE AIR THEY HAD A LOT OF CASUALTIES BECAUSE THEY'RE CARRIED ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND TROOPS AND THIS WAS NOW LATE AT NIGHT I THINK ABOUT AND ELEVEN ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT BUT ANYWAY SHE GOT INTO THE CLYDE WITH WITHOUT ANYTHING BUT DAMAGE FROM FROM THE SEA WE LIMP IN LATER ON NOW IN THE CLYDE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ANCHOR AND WE COULDN'T GO FURTHER IN TO GREENOCK TO GREENOCK BECAUSE AFTER THAT YOU GO THROUGH THE BOOM AND THE BOOM IS CLOSED AT NIGHT UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESCESSARY TO OPEN THE BOOM WHICH PREVENTS OR ELSE TO PREVENT AND YOU BOATS GETTING AT THAT POINT SO AT THE OTHER SIDE WHERE WE HAD TO TIE UP TO A BOY WE HAVE TWO BOY JUMPERS TO TIE UP TO A BOY YOU HAVE TO STOP AND YOU HAVE TO LOWER YOUR WHALE WITH THE BOY JUMPER AND THE ROBBERS IN IT TO TAKE YOU TO THE BOY WITH THE CHAIN TO CLIP IT TO THE BOY WELL IF I'VE GIVEN YOU A PICTURE OF HOW ROUGH THE STORM WAS IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT FIRST WHALER WE WE AN AND LET DOWN ONTO THE WATER MANAGED TO GET DOWN SAFELY BUT GOT WASHED AWAY WITH A CREW IN IT FURTHER DOWN THE CLYDE THAT WAS A WAY FOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO LOWER ANOTHER WHALER ALL OF US WAS UP ON THE FOLK SHORE WE KNOW ALL THE SEAMEN THAT COULD HELP WAS UP ON THE FOLK SHORE AND A CAUSE YOU CAN'T USE YOUR ANCHOR YOU JUST USE AN ANCHOR CHAIN WHICH GOES WITH A WIRE ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE ANCHOR CHAIN AND THE WHALER HAS TO TAKE THIS WIRE TO THE BOY TO CLAMP IT ON TO THE BOY AND THEN THE BOY IS PULLED BY THE ANCHOR CHAIN NEARER THE SHIP SO THAT THEY CLIP IT ON SO ANYWAY THEY LOWERED THE SECOND WHALE THE BOY JUMPER MANAGED TO GET ON TO THE BOY AND IN DOING SO BROKE HIS WRIST AND IN THE END AFTER I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO CLIP UP TO THE BOY AND ON THE CAPTAIN SAID TOPS ALL ROUND I HATED THE SMELL OF RUM ANYWAY AND NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD MITOTCAUSE IT'S HORRIBLE BUT WHEN I HAD IT THAT NIGHT BECAUSE WE WERE FROZEN FROZEN STIFF AND WE LANDED TO GET AWAY WITH IT BUT NOTHING WAS EVER SAID ABOUT THIS TYPE OF THING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH OUR PEOPLE AT THE PORTS KNEW THESE BIG SHIPS COME COME IN AND IT WAS NOT A THING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THE GERMANS ALSO KNEW THAT THEY WERE BRINGING THE ORDERS LARGE NUMBERS BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS THAT COULD CARRY AND AN ANY OF THE U BOAT CAPTAINS I UNDERSTAND AND THIS IS NORMAL KNOWLEDGE WERE OFFERED A LARGE SUM OF MONEY THOUSANDS OF WHAT THE SALT JOSE MARK DOSE MARK THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK AND THE HIGHEST OF THE BAT OF HONOURS TO HAVE KNOCKED DOWN ANY ONE OF THESE MONSTERS BUT WE NEVER LOST ONE FORTUNATELY I HAVE TO SAY BUT THE QUEEN MARY AND WAS REALLY BATTERED VERY BADLY BATTERED HOW WE DIDN'T GET TURNED OVER I GOT NO IDEA WHEN YOU TALKING ABOUT BIG SEAS WHAT SUICIDE YOU TOOK WELL AS IF YOU'RE THE DISEASE ITSELF YOU'RE TALKING THAT WELL AND THERE IS IS GENERALLY KNOWN THAT SOME OF THE WAVES WERE SIXTY FOOT HIGH NOW IF YOU THINK OF SIXTY FOOT GOING UP THAT WAY WHEN YOU GO UP TO THE WAVE AND YOU COME DOWN TO THE TROUGH YOU GOT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOOT AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN CUT THROUGH THOSE WAVES AND THE BIG SHIPS OR THE SMALL SHIPS YOU ACTUALLY GO UP ON THAT WAVE AND THEN YOU FEEL IT DID YOU COME DOWN WITH A CRUNCH LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU GO UP TO THE NEXT ONE AND ALL THE TIME YOUR CORK SCREWING YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT STILL AND YOU GET USED TO THIS AFTER THE FIRST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT RED ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE YOU YOU GO THROUGH A NORMAL AND CORE FLATS THEY'RE CALLED ON THE DESTROYER THE NORMAL CORRIDOR ON THE FLOOR ON A FLAT AND DESTROYER BRIDGES ABOUT THAT WIDE WELL WHEN YOU FIRST GO ABOARD ONE LIKE THAT AND IT WAS FAIRLY CALM WHEN WE SET OUT FOR SCAPE FROM GREENOCK BUT AS YOU WALK ALONG THE DECK COMES UP TO MEET YOU AS IT GOES UP AND YOU HIT YOUR FEET AS YOU GO DOWN ON THE DECK BUT BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THAT DECK HAS GONE AWAY AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN AND THIS HITS YOU FROM THE TOP AND THEN WHILE THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING THIS THIS BULLET HITS YOU NEXT YOU KNOW THAT BALKED HITS YOU SO IN TIME YOU LEARN TO WALK LIKE A SAILOR AND AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN YOU GO DOWN WITH IT AND COME UP WITH IT AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL FIND SAILORS HAD WHEN YOU GET ASHORE THEY WORK WITH A ROLL WALK WITH A ROLL THAT IS JUST THAT HERE STILL WALKING ON THE SHIP S AFTER THE END OF THE WAR A DAY NIGHT YOU ARE FINISHED YOU ON VEDA ITSELF WE WERE AND AS HAS THE NINTH OF MAY WE WERE BRINGING IN THE OLDER FRANCS AND WE GOT NOTICED THAT THE PEACE AND HAD BEEN DECLARED FOR THE NEXT DAY AND WERE COMING IN TO GO INTO GREENOCK SO WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN THE LAST OF THE WINSHIP CONVOYS BEFORE THE WAR ENDED SO WE ARRIVED IN GREENOCK I BELIEVE IT IS HARDER WEDNESDAY OR SUNDAY AND HALF THE SHIP'S COMPANY WAS ALLOWED LEAVE WHICH WASN'T ME I'M AFRAID I WASN'T ONE OF THE SHIP'S COMPANY BUT THEY WENT ASHORE TO TO GREENOCK AND HAD A GOOD TURN NO TIME SO THEN WE STILL CARRIED ON WITH SOME OF THESE CONVOYS AFTER THERE BECAUSE SOME THERE WAS QUITE A FEW OF THE NEW BOATS THAT APPARENTLY MISSING AND LOT THEM AND ONE OR TWO WENT TO BRAZIL OR WHATEVER SO THERE WAS A SURE STILL A CHANCE THAT IF THERE WAS A ROPE ROBE YOU BOAT AROUND HE COULD HAVE KNOCKED DOWN SOME OF THE UM MONSTERS WE WERE SURE TO BRING HIM BACK IN BUT WE HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL BUT TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT ANYWAY AND WE WERE THEN DESTINED TO GO ACROSS TO THE END TRY TO END THE JAPANESE WAR SO TWO BY TWO OUR FLOTILLA WENT IN FOR REFITS WE WE WENT IN FOR A REFIT LATE IN MAY AND JUNE AND BECAUSE WE WERE GOING OUT THERE ANYWAY BUT FORTUNATELY WHILE I WAS ON AND LEAVE TO GO OUT THERE THE SHIP WAS DOWN AT AN DEVONPORT BEING REFITTED THE WAR ENDED SO I TOOK UP A TELEGRAM TO SAY DAY LEAVE EXTRA THEY LEAVE EXNER WHEN WE CAME BACK TO THE SHIP WE STILL HAD TO GO OUT THERE BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING TO CLEAR UP AFTER THE WAR WELL AND THE WHOLE OF OUR FLOTILLA WE'RE OUT THERE THEN WE WERE THE LAST TWO SO AS WE READ OUT GIBRALTAR MALTA ADEN AND PLACES LIKE THAT WE THOUGHT WE WAS UNDER A LOVELY SUMMER CRUISE BUT THEN WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE NO WHEN WE GOT TO TRINCOMALEE THAT WAS OUR NAVAL BASE WE BASED AT TRINCOMALEE AND WE ALSO BASED AT SINGAPORE OR WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE AND THIS WAS JUST ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THE WAR AND WE WERE CARRYING OUT AN EXERCISE WITH A TIMES SUSSEX AND ANOTHER SHIP AND THE CAPTAIN THE FLAT AT THE FLOTILLA LEADER WHO WAS ON THEMES CESAR AND OURSELVES IN CAVALIER WERE ORDERED TO GO WITH THE SUSSEX TO A PROBLEM SO WE IMMEDIATELY WENT AT FULL SPEED WE WERE SENT TO TO JAVA WE STOPPED ON A COUPLE OF TROOP SHIPS ON THE WAY I CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT BUT WE TOOK ON BOARD OUR FOR OUR FULL DECK WAS COVERED WITH INDIAN TROOPS ARMED INDIAN TROOPS AND THE CAVALIER IS THE SAME AND THE CAESAR WAS ALSO AND THE SUSSEX ANCHORED OUTSIDE SURE BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GET IN WE COULD HARDLY GET IN CAUSE THERE WAS A A SUNKEN A JAPANESE CRUISER IN THERE IN THE WAY SO CESAR WENT IN FIRST CAUSE SHE WAS FLED TO THE LEADER FULL OF TROOPS WE WENT IN SECONDS AS WE WERE SECOND AND THEN THE CAVALIER AFTER US AS WE WENT IN IT WAS DAYLIGHT WE HAD ALL OUR TROOPS ON BOARD SO IF WE HAD ANY TROUBLE WE COULDN'T HAVE USED OUR GUNS BECAUSE OF TRUTH LUCKILY WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE FROM THE SHORE BUT AS WE CAME INTO SURABAYA LIKE I WAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE AND THERE WAS BODIES DOZENS OF THEM IN WHITE NAVAL UNIFORMS I THINK THEY WERE PROBABLY DUTCH I DON'T THINK THEY WAS OURS BUT WE WERE SLOWLY MOVING AVOIDING THIS WRECKAGE AND AVOIDING THE BODIES AND YOU GOT TO THE STAGE NOW WHEN WE ARE IN A WAR BODIES IN THE WATER MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU YOU GET ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT THEY WERE BODIES AND DEAD NOW AND THAT SO ANYWAY WE SPIRIT SLOWLY MOVED IN WE ANCHORED IN THE THE DOCK THERE AND ON ONE BY ONE CRUISER DISGORGED HER TROOPS FIRST AND WE CAME IN NEXT SO THE THREE OF US ALL OUR TROOPS WENT ASHORE THE DOCKS HAD BEEN ALREADY TAKEN OVER BY AN AURA THE ECA ARMY I THINK HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN AHEAD AND AND IT WAS THE INDIAN INDONESIAN REBELS THAT FIGHTING HAD ALREADY KILLED AND BRIGADIER MALLABY THAT WAS THE ARMY AND BOSS AND HIS TROOPS WENT ASHORE AND WE STAYED THERE READY FOR AND A LOT OF SURVIVORS AND OF THE DUTCH PEOPLE THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS FROM A CAMP RIGHT THE OTHER SIDE OF A CURB AND THEY WEREN'T GOING TO BE BROUGHT UNDER AN ESCORT OF ANOTHER TRUCE SHE BRIGADE THAT MALLABY HAD BEEN KILLED UNDER A TRUCE AND NOW THIS SUPPOSED TO BEEN ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DUTCH PEOPLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN MOSTLY IN A CAMP AT THE OTHER SIDE THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS BY ANOTHER TRUCE AN ARMY TRUCKS AND GUARDED BY INDIAN TROOPS THEY ARE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS TO US AND WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THEM ON BOARD AND WE WERE TO TAKE THEM OUT TO THE TROOPERS WHICH COULDN'T GET INTO THE HARBOUR WELL WE WERE THEN TOLD WHILE WE WAIT FOR THESE PEOPLE TO COME ACROSS WE WERE TO GO OUT INTO THE WATER BECAUSE WE MIGHT BE USED WHICH WAS WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AS IT HAPPEN WHEN THIS CONVOY OF ARMY TRUCKS GUARDED BY INDIAN TROOPS GOT AS FAR AS SURABAYA THEY FOUND THAT THEY WERE STOPPED ALTHOUGH THEY HAD A WHITE FLAG THEY WERE STOPPED BY THE POST OFFICE WHICH WAS FULL OF INDIAN RE AND INDONESIAN REBELS THE INDIAN REBELS WERE SET UP TRENCH MORTARS AND MACHINE GUNS AND AS SOON AS THE CONVOY GOT THERE THEY SHOT THE THE TROOPS THAT WERE GUARDING THE CONVOY AND THE CONVOY COME TO THE HALT SO WE WERE CALLED IN TO USE OUR FOUR INCH FOR FIVE GUNS SO WE HAD TO FIRE ON THE TOWN AND WE TOOK OUT THE POST OFFICE WITH THE INDONESIAN TROOPS IN IT AND THEN THE CONVOY COME THROUGH WE WENT BACK IN THE HARBOUR AND WE HAD ALL THE UM A DUTCH PEOPLE ON BOARD AND WE TOOK HIM OUT TO SAY SO WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T CERTAINLY HAVE TO GO ASHORE WE HAD TO GO ASHORE LATER ON TO GUARD SOME OF THE WAREHOUSES AND AND SO ON BUT WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO ANY FIGHTING THE ONLY FIGHTING WE HAD TO DO WAS FUN AGAIN BECAUSE I WAS ON THE UPPER DECK AT AT THE TIME WHEN WE WERE CALLED IN TO FIRE AND I WAS CALLED OFF THE UPPER DECK AND TO FIRE AN X AND Y GUN AND I SAID I'M NO GUNNER HE SAID YOU ARE TODAY SO THEY PUT ME ON THE AM ON THE GUN GUNNERY WITH ANOTHER ONE AND WE HAD TO FIRE TO THE DIRECTION OF A SPOTTER PLANE
