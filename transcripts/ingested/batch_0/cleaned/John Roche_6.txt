what do you remember of iceland it was a dreary sort of a place we were in a place called valfurva and now and again the boys may get a chance to go down to reykjavik that was the capital anybody went down there on a day trip or something it was expensive down there down by our anchorage we built our own football pitch offshore that would be our main thing or we could fish over the side all day and all night really we were there once and a mighty gale blew up so we had to pull in our anchors the wind was about one hundred and twenty miles per hour a lot of the ships dragged anchors and a couple of them went to ground every ship had two anchors down and we were steaming half speed ahead into the wind just to hold your position it was a big storm that came up how did hms renown handle the big sea she was a good sea boat really she was a heavy ship she weighed about thirty two thousand tonnes she rolled like any other ship would in a big ocean like that did you have good sea legs yes i was never sea sick really because growing up as a boy i used to go out in the boat fishing so i was used to being in a boat being at sea so i wasn't really worried a lot of people were sea sick all their life really even lord mountbatten he was sea sick all his career so some people never got over it do you have any stories or any recollections of the arctic convoys that you want to share no not really i guess we were just happy to get back to scapa flow to get away from it all really even scapa flow was a dreary old place you hoped you could maybe run ashore up to edinburgh or something like that it was just dreary i suppose if you like a dreary old job that had to be done ok after the arctic you probably went down to the mediterranean didn't you we did yes and we done about twelve months there escorting convoys to malta we did a lot of that we were down there with the arc royal and sheffield and we were know down there as force h we done a lot of escorting convoys to malta tell me about some of those convoys there were various types of convoys they'd try and get the bigger faster sort of ships that could nip through there if we were escorting convoys through the mediterranean we would leave gibraltar in the night time just as it was getting dark and head out to the atlantic because there were so many spanish people watching where were going and then i guess they would transmit the information over to berlin every movement of every ship was logged back to germany so we'd go out into the atlantic and then about midnight when it got dark we would turn around and go full speed back to gibraltar and then when dawn came up we were well away into the mediterranean away from gibraltar hopefully we'd thrown them off the scent i don't know if we were successful or not after a couple of days you would see an italian aircraft being nosey to see what was going on and where we were i suppose you played a bit of cat and mouse if you could talk about the italian bombers was it just italian bombers mostly at that end of the med it was italian bombers they dropped a few bombs close to us there were german u boats and italian submarines again you tried to outwit them by zigzagging and keeping up a steady speed and some of those convoy ships were big ships and they were fast ships hopefully they could get through to malta by dodging the u boats with their speed we would near enough escort them to malta and then the destroyers would continue to take them while we would turn around and escort more convoys we were making sure the italian fleet weren't going to come out and attack the convoy which would be our prime job really we were in action with the italian fleet one time tell me about that we got information that the italian fleet were at sea and we had admiral somerville on board he was the admiral great guy everybody liked him we had the hms arc royal with us and sheffield and a couple of us chased after these italian ships so we got into action with them we open fired on them but italian ships were faster than us really they nipped away and we chased them within about thirty miles of the italian coast and of course admiral somerville decided then that his prime job was to look after the convoy really he actually got into trouble with winston churchill because he wasn't really chasing the italians into their harbours which would have been a dangerous game really we could have been opening to bombers and all sorts of things we could have also been sunken with the convoy we could have been vulnerable really he was hot over the coals about it but it wasn't until recently afterwards that he agreed that somerville had done the right thing everyone was very pleased about that because he was a very popular admiral i take it then you were in you action stations basically constantly by that time i had been on the ship a couple of years i had served on various action stations i had been in the transmitting station i had been on one of the four five guns id been look out position by that time i had also become a torpedo man i was a leading seaman therefore i became a leading torpedo operator and we was to look after the electrical side of the ship i had different duties by then i became a semi electrician if you like looking after normal light or ships fire control and all sort of things like that that's what my career became afterwards from being a torpedo man when you used to fire the fifteen pounders did it break all the bulbs oh very often the fifteen inch yes the lights would fly off the bulk header it all depended on what bearing it was on if it was on the beam then yes sometime if you were firing ahead the gun was trained and needed its own upper works when the gun fired the blast would affect the nearest part of the ship to it in matter of fact they used to have these over the head fans but if we knew we would be firing a fifteen inch we would have to quickly take them down because the blast would blow them off board
