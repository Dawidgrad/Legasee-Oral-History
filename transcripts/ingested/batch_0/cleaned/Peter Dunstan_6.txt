so you've headed onto singapore what can you remember of that and was there any anticipation about what you were there facing no i remember we steamed past steamed past singapore town and up into the dockyard i've actually been back and i've actually got photographs i've got a photograph somewhere of the prince of wales tied up in the navy dockyard in singapore and when i organised one of the first groups of prisoners of war back as a tour guide we got back and went into the dockyard and i've got a photograph of exactly the same position that the prince of wales was in so you head from singapore down to malaya is that right well we were the prince of wales there was a report came in from the army that there was a japanese invasion up around the area of kota bharu which is north the north of malaya and as the report was there was a japanese invasion fleet there they dispatched the prince of wales and the repulse to get in amongst them and sort them out but it was a complete trap because the japanese had accumulated god knows how many twin engine bombers in saigon and of course as we got up in towards kuanton and that of malaya we were well within their range and of course as soon as we got in their range the japanese went for us and they were coming at us about ten twelve aircraft at a time five at one side and five at the other side so it didn't matter which way you turned you steered the ship you were running into their torpedoes and the first torpedo of the japanese hit the prince of wales on the port after it was the we had four propellers two on each side and the torpedo hit the ship just forehead of the inner propeller they bent the shaft twelve inch diameter shaft the explosion bent the shaft and it ripped the back end of the prince of wales open and of course we went down we went down to an angle of about fifteen degrees straight away with the amount of water that flooded in there i think some of the boffins of that reckon there was about ten thousand gallons of water flooded the prince of wales in about thirty seconds well of course in view of the fact that we were that badly damaged and that and we were starting to sink they gave the order to abandon ship and the sergeant in charge of our gun ordered us on to the focsle of the ship counted us out and found he got the whole of the royal marine crew and then ordered us to jump or to abandon ship rather and i can recall there was a rope there and i went down the rope so far caught my foot in one of the portholes in the side of the ship and just sort of gave myself a push and let go and dropped and it's been calculated it was seventy feet from the time i let go of the rope to the water i tell people today i won't even jump in the bath it's too deep but then we swam the navy have two or three different types of rescue and one of them is a what they call a carley float which is a great big what ten feet in those days it was ten feet square mat with floats placed every about a foot away from it from each other as a rescue float and i know i got onto held onto the side of that we with a load of other chaps we pushed it and that towards the destroyer and climbed up aboard the destroyer and which was one of our three escort destroyers and after that we were taken back to singapore what was it like to be you know that did you i mean you talked before about being hit by a shell you didn't feel it did you instantly know were you in your gunnery position and did you instantly know that this was a major hit well yes because of the angle she developed although i was in the as i say in the transfer room below deck immediately the shape and that of the room where we was we knew it was over and the sergeant in charge of the gunnery as i say ordered us aboard to evacuate and abandon ship what was it like when you were in the water i mean could you see all these japs buzzing around ooh no the japs the japs knew they got us they in fact one flight did come over and they signalled to the destroyer i can remember this piece the japanese signalled to the destroyer to cease fire and pick up survivors and this was told over the tannoy of the destroyer that and of course our own destroyer was picking up survivors and we were taken back to singapore which destroyer was it i m not sure whether it was the destroyer express or the destroyer electra there was the express the electra and the tenedos the three destroyers the tenedos was an australian destroyer i'm not sure at this present moment in time which one it was it could have been express did you actually see the prince of wales go under oh yes yes what was that like i mean you spent a good year on her the only thing i can remember is the fact that i was well away from her because you knew that when a ship sinks i mean the undertow will take you down as well and a number of us were who were hanging on to the side of this cork float we were pushing it away and one of the chaps said you know yelled she's going and she turned completely over i can remember this funny enough talking to you i can remember these sort of things she turned completely over and you could hear the guns the big fourteen inch guns there were three sets of them the weight of those turrets they were just dropping out of the ship because they weren't anchored down i mean the weight of the naval gun i mean is such that it rolls around on bearings and that and once she's upside down i mean they just fall out and when you got on to whichever the destroyers it was did you you know is this when you became aware that you'd lost some of your mess or were you all no you were just thankful that you were aboard the you know a rescue ship it wasn't until we got back to singapore and even then we didn't know until the royal marines now i can't remember exactly what happened now but once you got back to singapore the prince of wales royal marines were detailed of as guards for the singapore naval wireless station and the repulse royal marines were detailed to guard they navy stores in the royal navy dockyard so it was only then and even then i don't think we really had a roll call for exactly who was missing it isn't until i been doing this research now that i know who was lost because of the dates given of death
