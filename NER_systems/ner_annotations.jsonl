My mother was Irish;\nmy father was very English and in actual fact had fought in the First World\nWar in the Highland Light Infantry and won the Military Cross in the Somme\nand, um, we had a very happy childhood in Harrogate, we really did and we\nused to go on holiday every summer to my mother’s relatives in Ireland, and\nwe use to, we had a lovely childhood really when I think about it. A very happy\nchildhood with very good parents.\n\n01:00:49\n\nAnd did you have a sense as a young person that things were changing,\nthat there might be a war or was it literally, war was declared?\n\n01:00:58\n\nI think we used to hear my parents talking about, I think the first thing I\nremember, in actual fact, was hearing, because we used to listen to the radio\na lot and I think the first thing I remember is coming back from Munich waving\na piece of paper. Chamberlain, Neville Chamberlain and in actual fact I’ve\noften thought since that man was a bit of a hero ‘cause he knew perfectly\nwell. He had to buy us at least a year and he made himself look a fool. That’s\nonly my own personal feeling, looking back, you know. And, um, I don’t think\nwe knew, I think the first thing was, we used to reach a lady, we used to go\nout for walks with my mother, um, or maybe when we were going to school,\nbecause Shelia and I went to the convent, the Holy Child Convent in\nHarrogate where we got a very good modern education which was marvelous\nwith modern thinking. We used to talk to a Mrs Menuhin and apparently she\nwas Yehudi Menuhin’s aunt and she had come over to this country from\nGermany in 1936, something like that, and I think she told my mother and I\nremember her telling me that things were happening like somebody would\ndisappear or be taken away in the night and some weeks after that a little\nbox would be delivered by the postman, whatever it was, with ashes inside.\nSo it was kind of known that things were happening but I don’t think it was\ngenerally known.\n\n01:02:24\n\nWhere were you when war did break out?\n\n01:02:26\n\nIn Harrogate.\n\n01:02:27\n\nDo you remember the day?\n\n\n01:02:29\n\nWhat is said\nWell when we were living in Harrogate, in actual fact, we were in Ireland on\nholiday and we always used to go from Liverpool, we used to like the boat\njourney most of all I think from Liverpool it used to be an eight hour journey.\nLiverpool to Dublin, and we used to leave the car then get the overhead\nrailway in Liverpool, out of the, I don’t know what dock it was Gladstone I\nthink and at this particular time it was the week before war broke out, funnily\nenough, and there was a mock air raid in Liverpool and then they wouldn’t\nlet us board the ship and there were all sorts of things going on ???? we\ndidn’t sail until about 6 o’clock in the morning instead of 10 o’clock the night\nbefore. And we went, the first people we went to visit was my aunt and uncle\nup in Caven which is just south of the northern border and my uncle, in actual\nfact, was a detective and I remember us sitting there listening to Jim and I\ncan remember my father say, “Oh my God, not another bloody war!” listening\nto the radio. And so to come back it was a bit of a performance really cos we\ncouldn’t, we couldn’t come back the way we’d gone because they were taking\nthose Liverpool-Dublin ships over for hospital ships so we had to go\nHolyhead, Dunmurry. And the ships were all blacked out and it was rough\nand I can remember we got on the train at Holyhead and the lights were all\ncovered with blue paper and I think that was it, you know, but we thought it\nwas a bit exciting, I think. My parents must have been worried silly. And we’d\nalso heard, in actual fact that the Athenia had been sunk. The Athenia was\nthe first ship to be torpedoed up in the Northern Irish Sea, I think, and I think\nthere were a number of Americans on it which caused a bit of a stir for the\ntime being.\n\n** Start of Film 2\n\n01:04:23\n\nSo how did war change things for you in Harrogate then?\n\n\n\n\n01:04:27\n\nWell the first thing that happened, in actual fact, was there was an air raid\nsiren, I can’t remember whether it was the end of 1939 or the beginning of\n1940 because there was a bomber over Harrogate in fact they had heard an\nawful lot of the chaps that were later on training to be pilots in America and\nCanada came back to Harrogate first of all before they were sent to their units\nand the siren went, so we all got in the cupboard under the stairs and my two\nbrothers and sister rushing out to have a look and I said “It’s a Dornier,” and\nI know the other one said “It’s not a Dornier, it’s a Heinkel,” and there was an\nargument went on and nothing much happened really, but my mother used\nto say “If a German comes to the door, I’m going keep my garden,” the thing\nthat you put anti-pest control things in, “I’m going to keep that and if a German\ncomes to the door I shall pump it full!” and my father used to say, “Yes, I can\nsee him standing there like a lemon while you pump insecticide into his face!”\nAnd then of course there was the question of rationing and my mother… my\nfather was in timber and plywood and that was taken over by the government,\nso he had to find another job and joined the Ministry of Aircraft Production,\nwhich meant a reduction in his salary in what he was getting, but nonetheless\nit was better than nothing and my mother also got a job there as well,\nalthough she was a trained nurse, but by that time she was, I suppose, in her\nforties, I would have thought, in actual fact. And then my father got sent to\nLondon.\n\n01:06:04\n\nSo he was in the Ministry of Aircraft Production on Milbank and then Thames\nHouse, or wherever it was, and that’s how, I don’t know that it, I think, in\nactual fact we kind of took it as it came, I think when you’re kids, you know. I\nmean I must have been about thirteen when war broke out, I think, fourteen,\nI can’t remember. But it was kind of a bit exciting and my aunt who lived in\nLiverpool who was a bit of an invalid, she came to live with us for a while and\nI can see her sitting by the fire in our house while my two brothers had this\nthing down from the table and they had Dinky toy naval ships on it and there\nwas a row. “I sunk the Ark Royal!” “No you haven’t sunk the Ark…” “I sunk\nthe…” and my aunt saying, “Boys, boys. There’s enough war going on\nwithout you two going to blow through the dining room.” So this is how,\npeople think it was all drama all at once, do you know what I mean? But then\nyou gradually began to realise there was Dunkirk and all the rest of it, but I\ndecided I wanted to join up but I couldn’t do it till I was seven… well with my\nfather’s permission it was seventeen and a half and on my own account it\nwas eighteen and I didn’t want to wait until I was eighteen.\n\n01:07:15\n\nWhy did you want to be a WREN?\n\n01:07:19\n\nI’ve no idea! I just wanted to. Why does anybody want to join a particular\nthing, you know? I was always mad keen on history. I mean nowadays I am\nstill very keen on history, military history in particular, and, um, that’s what I\nwanted to do.\n\n01:07:38\n\nOk, so when you had the opportunity to join, just talk through the\nprocess…\n\n\n\n\n01:07:45\n\nWell, the thing, the thing is, I wanted to join the WRENs and I wanted to join\nas soon as I could which was seventeen and a half but I had left school when\nI was sixteen and I wanted to do something so the man that lived next door\nto us was the works manager of the Yorkshire ????? Chemical Company in\nLeeds in Hunslet so he said “Well you can have a job in our laboratory where\nwe tested stuff coming up from the factory against standards that we have.”\nAnd I worked there for a year. My sister used to complain that I smelt when I\ncame home and I used to go back between Harrogate and Leeds everyday\non the train and I think I earned 22 and sixpence a week in old time money\nand I think I used to be able to treat my sister to things and do all sorts of\nthings. I used to walk up into the centre of Leeds at lunchtime and go to Lyons\nand have my lunch or whatever it was. Anyway, eventually the time came\nwhen I could, dad willingly gave me, because he said he’d enjoyed being in\nthe forces and being in the Highland Light Infantry, so I applied and it must\nhave been just at the time when they were wanting to increase more people\nfor what we called P5, and I’ll explain that a bit later. So I was summoned for\nan interview in Leeds, I think, I can’t remember much about it and the next\nthing I knew I’d been accepted and on my way to London.\n\n01:09:11\n\nI’d never been to London in my life, before and it used to take six or seven\nhours to go by train from Harrogate to London and a friend of my mother’s\nmet me and put me on, I knew that I had to go to Mill Hill. Now Mill Hill was\na great big building there, it was going to be the, I think the Medical Research\nCouncil were going to use but it was taken over by the Navy and that was\nthe WREN training and drafting depot and it was a great big tall building, it\nhad a great big, it would have been a car park nowadays in front of it which\nthey called the quarter deck and we had ???? flying from it and if you went\nacross the quarter deck you had to go at the double and we learnt strait away.\nAnd then we were given navy blue overalls and we were set to work. Naval\nhistory, PT on the roof and don’t forget it was the end of October or\nsomething. PT on the roof and it was cold and we thought it was marvellous\nand we used to be awoken in the morning by a claxon at 5 o’clock and set to\nwork scrubbing. We still thought it was marvellous! I made friends with a girl\nfrom Yorkshire as well; Shelia Tong and she said, “This is exciting, isn’t it?”\nand I said “Yes” and she said “We’re really in the Navy!” Anyway we then\nwent for interviews as to what we were going to do and they said “There are\nonly three categories left and that is cooks, stewards or P5.” And we said\n“What’s P5?” “We can’t tell you,” she just said. Oh that sounds exciting.\nSeventeen and a half.\n\n** Start of Film 3\n\n\n\n01:10:43\n\n01:12:33\n\nWhat is said\nSo we went for the interview for P5. What is it? Can’t tell you.So we said, so\nthen they said to us “Technical or clerical?” and she said, “Well technical\nsounds more interesting, technical.” OK. Well we were left there another two\nweeks they were probably doing, checking our background and so on and so\nforth and we weren’t even given our uniforms. We were then given our\nuniforms and piled into a bus with our luggage and sent off and wonder where\nwe’re going to. We landed up in Eastcote which is a suburb of London and it\nwas a great big, a part building site, they were all huts they were already\nworking there and it was one of the Bletchley Park outstations and why they\nhad outstations was so the only, in the end I think they only made 210\nbombes which I’ll explain later the things we were going to operate and they\ndidn’t, if they was bombing they didn’t want them all destroyed so there was\nsome at Bletchley, some at Stanmore, Eastcote and another one down in the\ncountry where we worked in the stables. So that’s where we learnt what we\nwere going to do, in fact. And it was very hard work. Apparently I’ve learnt\nsince they were looking for girls that weren’t less, strong girls that weren’t\nless than 5ft 6, 5ft 8 in height and I was 5 8 and a half at that age. And it was\nhard physical work, it really was, you had to learn, what you would do is\nyou’d, you’d get a menu, what they called a menu in, which used to come\nover a scrambler phone a green phone and according to that that’s how you\nchose the drums on the front and plugged up the back, it almost impossible\nto describe, in actual fact, and then you set the thing going.\nAnd the plugging up of the back was the most difficult thing of the lot really.\nYou set it going and at the side if that’s, if that was say a machine, at the side\nthere used to be a place where you could, if it stopped you could read off\nsome numbers or letters from there and you would pass that through the\nhatch to girls who were operating machines that were a bit like the German\nEnigma machine which checked and it would, either they said job up stroke\nor they’d say it was a fault and then you’d have to find the, there must have\nbeen a short somewhere so you’d have to go through all the little, the drums\nhad little brass brushes behind them and you had to go through those to find\nthe short, you had to take all the plugs out to find the short then start it up\nagain. But if, in actual fact, they call out if it was right they’d say job up stroke\nand you’d take the thing down and wait for the next job. And we used to work\n8 hours and we’d do a week, a week of days 8 to 4, whatever it was and then\na day off and then a week of evenings 4 to midnight and a day off and a week\nof midnight to 8 in the morning and then we’d get 4 days standoff.\n\n\n\n\n01:13:48\n\nIt was such a hard job we used to get 4 days after each cycle like that. So I\nwas there for a while, but while I was there there was the mini blitz, the fire\nblitz in London and this particular night we were all, we had huts that were\njoined together, they were open but they were joined together down the\nmiddle, each one had these bunks, you see, down the middle were all the\npipes the water pipes and all the rest of it and right at the end was the\nablutions for that particular hut and this particular night we were all in bed,\nShelia was on the top bunk and I was on the bottom bunk and the siren had\ngone, I never went in an air raid shelter in my life, in fact, and the siren had\ngone and then we peeped out through the blackout curtain and a house at\nthe end of the road was on fire, had been hit by, it was empty so it had been\nhit by incendiary bombs and the next thing we heard was this German aircraft\nand they did sound different, absolutely different. And it got lower and lower.\nThe next thing we knew “Bang! Crash! Wallop!” and all the rest of it and what\nthey had dropped in the hut, they managed to drop it in between the two\nblocks, was a Molotov, what we called a Molotov bread basket which was a\ncontainer full of 800 incendiary bombs and it would open at a certain altitude,\nbut because it was so low it hadn’t opened properly but some of them had\nburnt their way out of it and down it went and brought the ceiling down. Only,\nI think in actual fact, it was as close to me as it was to the hedge outside. Our\nbunk. But before that happened when we heard the thing coming low, Shelia\nhad leant over to me and said “Let’s get under the bedclothes!” Fine\nprotection, the silly things you say! Anyway, there was silence and then there\nwas the sound of water pouring in and all of the sudden the voice of the other\nWRENs near us shouting “Abandon ship!” Sounded like one of those war\ntime films! So Shelia clambered out over this thing and all this rubbish and\nthe roof and all the rest of it.\n\n01:15:55\n\nMad, absolutely mad. Well, I laugh when I think, in actual… We had, it was\nvery naval and the chief petty officer, the regulating petty officer, the master\nof arms was Golda Bernstein and I remember that I was fire watching, when\nI was in Eastcote which meant you had to be there to put out incendiary\nbombs and all the rest of it and I can remember I used to have to put my hair\nin curlers because it was long it was sort of page boy, you know, so I had to\nkeep it off my collar and two nights running the siren went and I couldn’t put\nmy curlers in and we had to go and be ready to go and do the thing with the\nstirrup pump and the third night I thought, I can’t go because it’s going to be\non my collar in the morning and division and I would be in trouble. So I went\nagain and I had to rush up and I put it into curlers and I rushed up to the\nregulating office and I went to put the tin hat on and it wouldn’t fit over the\ncurlers so I had to take it off and Golda Bernstein said “I hope the Luftwaffe\nwill wait whilst St George York takes her curlers out!” Embarrassment, you\nknow, sort of thing.\n\n** Start of Film 4\n\n\n\n\n01:17:11\n\nAnyway, the next thing that happened was, I was posted to, um, Bletchley if\nyou like because they had one hut at Bletchley which was operating bombes.\nNow the bombes, I ought to add at this point spelt with an e s on the end of\nit came from what the Poles who first found an Enigma machine and\nmanaged to smuggle it out, it was destined for the German Embassy in\nWarsaw, they called it a bomber, whatever it was, they managed to get it out\nand get it to Paris and the head of the France ???? or whatever it was they\ngot it to the UK, but that’s another story. Anyway, off we went and we were\nbilleted in the most gorgeous Elizabethan house it belonged to Cardinal\nWolsey, I’ve checked since and it really did! And Crawley Grange, and we\nused to go to, doing the same shifts we used to taken by bus into Bletchley\nPark, never went anywhere near the, I saw the house in the distance the only\nother thing I can remember is a tennis court with a funny, an American chap\nwho was playing tennis and he had one brown tennis shoe on and one white\nand he had a sort of bandanna round his head, I’ve never seen a man\nwearing that before, in my life. And we’d do our shift in the huts and we’d be\nback to Crawley Grange doing the same shifts.\n\n01:18:36\n\nIn the scale of the bombe, I mean how big are these individual cylinders\nand how big is the…\n\n01:18:42\n\nOh, well the machine was over 6 foot, it was over 6 foot. I should have looked\nat some of my things and seen if I’d got a picture of it. I should think, in actual,\nit was over 6 foot and it was enormous. I mean if you, it probably was as long\nas this table and very deep and you pulled out the back and all these great\nbig plugs at the back and there were rows upon rows of these drums, different\ncolours. I can’t remember, in actual fact, how we knew which colour to use\nbut anyway it used to come out, the most difficult thing of the lot was the\nmenu. First time I’d ever heard that used. The menu was how you plugged\nup the back, and if you looked at the diagram of a menu it looked like a sort\nof computerised thing, it was extraordinary. Poor old Alan Turing, baby, the\nbombs, you know.\n\n01:19:38\n\nAnd how did you, how did you learn it, I mean what was the sort of…\n\n01:19:42\n\nWell I had to learn, learn on the job, because it was already operating, you\nsee, at Eastcote so we would, we would just double up and learn how to do\nit.\n\n01:19:52\n\nAnd the sort of messages and stuff that you’re receiving or sending, is\nit a sender or receiver? Apologies.\n\n01:20:00\n\nIs what a sender?\n\n01:20:02\n\nIs the bombe…? What’s its actual…?\n\n\n\n\n01:20:04\n\nWhat, what it was actually doing was trying to get an “in” into a particular\nmessage and if it was, if it was an inside into particular message only the\nboffins at Bletchley Park would know they were all sorts of people who could\ndo crosswords puzzles or were chess masters and God only knows what and\nthey could work is what we would get or these menus that the bombe had\nbeen working on to try and get that the one thing that would… sometimes it\nwould be quite easy in a sense that the German Army, apparently were very\ncareless and some young soldier in the field would quite easily use each time\nas his particular starter thing the name of his girlfriend. Now that would be an\nimmediate in for somebody sitting, some boffin sitting in Bletchley Park\nworking it out, you know what I mean. But we, this is what we were trying to\ndo. Was an in. And it’s difficult to explain in fact I hardly understand it myself\nto certainly when I think about it sometimes.\n\n01:21:06\n\nDid you have to sign something; I mean what was the process?\n\n01:21:09\n\nOh, the Official Secrets Act I’ve signed that several times, um, no I mean it\nwas secret, I couldn’t tell my, I couldn’t tell my parents what I was doing. They\nsaid if people asked you said you were a clerk and then, or a writer as you\nwould be in naval terms but then people would look and say “Well why\nhaven’t you got your secretariat badge on then?” You kind of, pass it over.\n\n01:21:32\n\nYou mentioned earlier that you, you know, your father would be like\n“How do we know where the U-boats are” but you do explain that. So\nyou knew but you couldn’t say, just tell me quickly about that, how you\nmanaged your secrets.\n\n01:21:43\n\nWell, I can, well, it became second nature in a sense, strangely enough and\nthe emergency of it all. I’d go home on leave and I can remember very well\ngoing to the cinema and my mother used to particularly like the new\nMovietone news and they’d talk about, sort of, this was early 1944 I think and\nthey’d talk about U-boats being found, wolf packs and so on and so forth\nfound and all the rest of it and I remember my father saying “I wonder how\nthey knew that “ I couldn’t tell him, I knew but I couldn’t tell him. But it became\nsecond nature really.\n\n01:22:23\n\nWhat was your feeling about the work? Were you proud? Was it an\ninteresting job?\n\n\n\n01:22:30\n\nWhat is said\nWell, we felt we were doing a good job and it was monotonous and very very\ntiring. It was very monotonous. But you knew perfectly, you see, I seem to\nremember that some of the, that you knew whether it was German army,\nnavy and it would be, it would be sort of “Eagle” or “Porpoise” or “Wolf” or\nsomething and I remember, certainly in Stanmore I think, it was like that so\nwe’d know, we’d have an idea of whether, we knew what we were doing but\nwe knew no further than that. And how they managed to keep it secret was\neverything was in compartments, I mean, we never spoke to anybody in the\npark. We’d be bust in, done our 8 hour watch and bust out again and we\nnever, we never met anybody there, and the first time I went into the mansion\nitself was when we went there about 4 years ago with my family.\n\n** Start of Film 5\n\n01:23:33\n\nWhat was it like, I mean if you, it sounds like it was an exhausting job\nbut what was the, sort of Wrenery like that you were in what did you do\nfor socialising? Was there any down time? Did you enjoy yourself?\n\n01:23:45\n\nOh, we did. I mean, when it came to the Bletchley one when we were living\nin Crawley Grange we only had pass once a week so we’d probably only get\nout once a week, but we used to do all sorts of things and some people would\nknit and we’d read a lot and so on and so forth and I remember one night\nwhen somebody was having a séance and it was the most, it was very very\npeculiar in actual fact, I don’t know if you want me to tell you but in actual fact\nI was reading and this was this beautiful ballroom great big, two big bay\nwindows and ???? it was a gorgeous house not very big. And I was reading\nand I heard a lot of giggling going on and I looked over and they were at this\ntable with a glass, you know. And who was there? And they said “Georges”\nwith an “s” on the end of it like a French George. “What are you? Or who are\nyou ?” And they said “Tutor.” “Where are you?” “Standing beside you.” And\nthe whole thing broke up and hysterics and everything (screaming noise),\nyou know all those. Well one of the girls, in actual fact was engaged to a vicar\nup in Much Wenlock and she got very friendly with the vicar in the village\nthere and he said “It’s funny that,” because in actual fact Boswell who was\nthe favourite, the court favourite who was given that after Wolsey fell out of\nfavour and apparently, the story went, came home with a young bride and\nshe had a French tutor and in actual fact, she had a baby but the baby\ndisappeared. Was never seen again. And she was reputed to walk the house\nlooking for the baby and all the rest of it but the interesting sequel to that was\nthere was a small paneled room over the front door, later paneling, I think it\nwas Jacobean and it was a very old Victorian fireplace.\n\n\n\n\n01:25:43\n\nA funny fireplace to have and apparently the story was they had dry rot in\nVictorian times and they had to take some of the panelling out and all the\nrest, and they found the bones of a baby behind the paneling. I rest my case.\nI tell you that. I don’t know. I don’t know the answer but I do think it’s just a\nlittle… but we used to entertain ourselves. I seem to remember at one point\nthere was, was there an airfield nearby and we had, did we have Americans\nin, we had a party or something I don’t know, we had very good quarters\nofficer who used to make the most of whatever she had in the way of, um,\nfood and I think when we had a party she used to do things like she’d have\na saucer with a candle in the middle and flowers all the way round and you\ncould make, you’d make the most out of anything you could think of. I don’t\nremember what we actually did, I think once every 3 weeks or whatever we’d\ngo into Newport Pagnell or Bedford or, I can’t remember where it was. Then\nI was posted to Stanmore, another outstation. And I can remember that most\nbecause, in actual fact while I was there we, they had Wings For Victory, or\nsomething in Watford and we were invited to march, to join the march and\nbecause we were the only representatives of senior service we had to head\nit much to the annoyance of the RAF and the army. And, I can remember we\nhad a Royal Marines sergeant from Chatham to come and drill us and all the\nrest of it and I can hear him saying “stone frigate though this may be I’ll ‘ave\nyou girls marching proper!” And we were very proud to do it, in actual fact,\nbut that, at that, we were there when D-Day occurred and I can remember\nthat as well as anything.\n\n01:27:25\n\nWe had been confined to barracks for about two weeks before, we knew\nsomething was up but not what or when and I can remember I was fire\nwatching, I can remember it was a sunny morning the 6th of June and we\nwere fire watching and we’d had a bit of a sleep on mattresses on this\nconcrete corridor and I can remember woken up by the noise of aircraft and\ngoing outside and I could see the whole sky was full of aircraft, could hardly\nput a finger between them. Well then the Doodlebugs started, the flying\nbombs and I can remember there was another, they were very frightening I\nmust admit, very frightening because you knew when the engine stopped;\nstraight down. They had a Ram Jet I think, so much it would and then down\nthey’d go and hit whoever was underneath the explosive. This particular night\nthe only ones left in our watch I think was Shelia and I because we lived in\nYorkshire and there wasn’t time, I think we had a short break and there wasn’t\ntime for us to get up to Yorkshire so she’d gone down to the Ablutions block\nwhich was down this concrete corridor to get washed and I was just about to\nclimb into my bunk when I heard this Doodlebug, very low and very loud and\nthen it stopped. And I jumped out of my bunk and I ran down that concrete\ncorridor in my bare feet to join Shelia on the floor like this saying to myself, I\ndon’t want to die by myself. And you’d put your hands behind your neck and\nnothing happened and this is the, one of the only ones it, in actual fact didn’t\ncome straight down it managed to drift and landed about two miles away.\n\n01:29:10\n\nYou thought that was the end there, then?\n\n\n\n01:29:14\n\nWhat is said\nYeah. I also thought, it was, one night we went to the pictures in Ealing and\nthe siren went, this was when the mini blitz was on and we were walking\nacross Ealing Common so we thought we, it might be a good, there was lots\nof anti-aircraft fires so we thought it would be a good idea to lie down on the\ngrass for a while and there was a gorse bush and there we lay and when we\ngot up about as far as where I am from you there was a great big piece of\nshrapnel which I had for a long time, I don’t know where it’s gone. Yeah.\n\n** Start of Film 6\n\n01:29:47\n\nBecause we used to do fire watches it was very important because the idea\nthat you had to put out incendiary bombs because they kept, if they got going\nthey’d put high explosives down on top of it and we did a day’s course in\nfirefighting at Bletchley Park and the chap that was doing the course was in\narmy uniform but he was, apparently had been “I was a reporter before the\nwar and believe you me I saw some terrible sights after fires.” Anyway we\nwere shown how to put out petrol fires and all this sort of thing and how you\ncouldn’t spread, how you used foam and all the rest of it but the best of the\nlot was they had a hut and there was a duckboard and the entrance was\nthere and the exit was there and over in that corner was the, they lit a pile of\nboiling rags and they had a real blaze going in the corner and then they sent\nyou in there on your stomach with a stirrup pump and all the rest of it and\nwhen you got, full of smoke, when you got in there the chap said, “Now stand\nup.” And that was the best lesson I ever had because people think if you\nlook at a film and you see people with the smoke in a fire they start coughing.\nYou don’t, what happens in fact is exactly like someone put a vacuum cleaner\n(gasps) and brings every bit of air in your lungs out of it and your soon down\non your, flat on your stomach again. If most, terrible feeling, you see people\ncoughing but that’s not true it doesn’t happen like that. It sucks all the air out\nof you. And this chap said to us, “I’ve see people that have been brought out\nof fires and believe you me they’re not a pretty sight.” And we went “Ooohh!”\nWe did a day; it taught me a lot, in actual fact. We did put the fire out\nincidentally but the standing up was the lesson.\n\n01:31:37\n\nJust the heat…\n\n\n\n\n01:31:39\n\nYeah, it’s just as if somebody sucked all the air out of your lungs, instant.\nFrightening. So then, um, the next thing that happened was we, after D-Day\nI was posted back, went back to a place called Steeple Claydon in\nOxfordshire and Steeple Claydon was the home village, I believe of Florence\nNightingale and we lived in a place called “The Camp” it was a Victorian or\nEdwardian house but apparently it was were Cromwell had camped for the\nsiege of Oxford and it was very nice, it looked out over the valley but we used\nto go in a lorry to work in a stable block. This house I think belonged to a\nnaval commander who, we worked in the stable block and it was, we had\nfive, I think, bombes there, five or six bombes. In all our places we had RAF\ntechnicians because I believe I heard recently originally they thought, they\nhad RAF technicians operating these bombes when it, well “I wonder if\nwomen could do it,” sort of thing and that’s where the WRENS came in. But\nthat was quite, I can remember the technicians room there had guns in it as\nwell because when we were out on our own there we used to, to open, we\nhad an electronic door so if you went across the yard and you were just going\nto make the tea or the supper or whatever it was, you had to press this thing\n(knocks) with the V sign and then they’d open the door electronically. So then\nwe were in the stable block.\n\n01:33:18\n\nWhen you say there were five bombes, I mean how many women were\non the same shift?\n\n01:33:23\n\nEr, you would have double the amount because some would be operating\nthe bombes and some would be operating the checkers.\n\n01:33:33\n\nAnd were they noisy?\n\n01:33:35\n\nVery. Very noise (makes clicking noise) yeah, very noisy. ‘Cos, the click,\nclick, click, click, click, they were testing everything and they used to, you\nknow, if you were working you’d go through some of the ones that were on\nthe rack and because, did you ever have Scalextric cars and you know how\nthe brushes always were picking up dust and this sort, well that’s exact, this\nis, what was at the back of the, the drums and you’d always have into the\npair of tweezers cleaning them. So then I got…\n\n01:34:11\n\nSo each click is producing a different letter, is it?\n\n01:34:15\n\nYes, different letter, different letter ‘cos they all the alphabet down the edge\nof the, edge of the, the drums. Amazing, really.\n\n01:34:25\n\nAnd so each of these drums is clicking away.\n\n01:34:29\n\nWell there were a whole lot of them, you’d have red ones there and the next\nrow two lots, I can’t remember how many rows we had. Good many rows.\n\n01:34:36\n\nAnd where’s the signal going into it, I mean, what’s the trigger to make\nthem work?\n\n01:34:44\n\nElectricity. They were electric.\n\n\n\n01:34:48\n\nSure but, I mean.\n\n01:34:50\n\nElectromechanical, there’s nothing esoteric about them, nothing like\ncomputers or anything like that. They were electromechanical.\n\n01:34:58\n\nSo the menu where are you, where are you working the menu? Is that\non the front or the back?\n\n01:35:03\n\nWell you’d be told, I can’t remember how we were told about the drums, the\nonly thing I can remember is that the most difficult part of it was plugging up\nthe back. Where the menu was concerned. ‘Cos it was, to be told how many,\nit would be easy enough say well you put so many red drums or many, but\nthe complicated thing was the back, the plugging up of the back.\n\n01:35:25\n\nSo they’d say you know, the menu’s going to be Wolfpack or something\nand you’ve got to wire up the back properly.\n\n01:35:33\n\nWell you got these big, these big plugs to stick in. It’s very difficult to describe,\nin fact trying to remember it know sometimes I scramble my mind. I was\ncomplicated in some ways and yet not in others. It was, it was very\nmonotonous but you had to be meticulous but if you, I think anybody who’d\ndone it would say the plugging up at the back was the worst bit of the lot.\n\n01:35:56\n\nSo did you, did you ever get a sense of achievement, of what was\ncoming out of this?\n\n01:36:00\n\nOnly that the job had come up. From our point of view it then went up to\nBletchley Park on a secure scramble phone then they would start to make\nsense of it.\n\n01:36:10\n\nSo if you came up with a short it was like, “Oh no, not again!” you’ve\ngotta re…\n\n01:36:14\n\nExactly. You’d have to go through and where’s the short is it in the drums or\nin the… so if it wasn’t the drums it would be the plugs at the back and aahh,\nyou know.\n\n01:36:23\n\nAnd how long would it take to do from the moment you put a menu in\nto the outcome?\n\n01:36:26\n\nI can’t remember, to be perfectly honest. We were at it all the time, all the\ntime, all the time. We’d have a navy cocoa in the middle of the night, I can\nalways remember that, used to send a spoon up with it, it was great, fantastic!\n\n** Start of Film 7\n\n01:36:43\n\nCould you have fun in there? You know, is it…?\n\n01:36:46\n\nOh yes, oh yeah, we used to joke and laugh and all the rest of it certainly we\ndid. Certainly we did.\n\n\n\n\n01:36:50\n\nAnd just WRENS or you said you were actually RAF technicians?\n\n01:36:55\n\nRAF technicians, yes.\n\n01:36:57\n\nOK\n\n01:36:58\n\nI can remember one, and he was always, Jack, his name was that was in\nthe, stable block and he always had his tools in a back pocket there, and he\nalways had mug of tea in his hand and he used to say “Jack!” “Yes bud!” uhh,\n“Yes buddy! Or something. But it, oh we used to have fun, we used to have\nlaughs and all the rest of it and talks. But once the thing was running there\nwasn’t anything else to, you’d go through some of the other drums, but then\nthere would be times when you would sit at the machine at the table and\nhave a mug of cocoa or tea or whatever it was.\n\n01:37:42\n\nDid you notice that up to D-Day it was busier?\n\n01:37:48\n\nNo, it was busy. Well I, I only started doing it in October ’43 and I think, in\nactual fact, it probably that’s why they were recruiting for what they call P5,\nthat is HMS Pembroke 5 and that’s why they were recruiting, I think for that.\nAnd I think that’s why, if you were suitable. I’m beginning to think now that\nwhen they said there was only a cook, steward or P5 they knew nobody\nwanted to be a cook or a steward and maybe P5 would attract people, I don’t\nknow. If you were, providing you were suitable and you passed the, you\nknow, the security thing and all the rest of it.\n\n01:38:32\n\nAnd how long were you at Steeple Claydon then?\n\n01:38:34\n\n01:39:54\n\nWell, I was there, in actual fact, at Steeple Claydon until, I can remember I\nwasn’t working, I was back at the quarters and I can remember, the war was\nover and I, we heard bells ringing down in the village and I can remember we\nall stood there and cried. And then the next day we had to pack up and take\nourselves off and I can see us at, was it, not Bletchley station, anyway and\nthe train was crowded and we had suitcases and respirator cases and God\nonly knows what and the porter saying “Come on, come on! I don’t know why\nyou girls have got to travel on a day like this!” Do you think we’d travel if ????!\nCould have hit him! It’s a wonder he didn’t get lynched, in actual fact, and\nback to Stanmore and from then onwards we were dismantling the bombes.\nTaking them apart. Churchill’s orders apparently. And there was a quote that\nat one point Churchill had said about the whole operation “The geese that\nlaid the golden egg and never cackled.” And if anybody, if anybody had told\nit would have been, that would be, you know.\nYou were getting such cryptic messages, and seeing such cryptic…\nhow did you know what you were doing?\n\n\n\n\n01:40:00\n\nWell only on occasion in which we’d hear or be told but generally speaking\nwe were just grinding away, you know. But it, it was important, it seemed\nimportant, it was important you got the feeling it was important you know what\nI mean? It, and people wouldn’t put up with it nowadays, but what you’ve got\nto put you’re mind-set back into is what it was like during the war, and it was,\nand we knew perfectly well when you look at a map you see the last back in\nwas this country and everything else was German was Nazi Germany and\nall the rest of it, even France had gone and there was this sense of urgency,\nnot panic, urgency that I’ve never felt since.\n\n01:40:45\n\nSo even though you didn’t really know what you were doing, you were\nworking in a machine that was, you obviously signed the Secrets Act…\n\n01:40:50\n\nWe knew what it was doing, yeah, that’s right, we knew what it was doing,\nwhat it was contributing to, that in fact it was breaking German messages.\n\n01:41:00\n\nWas it ever explained to you like that?\n\n01:41:03\n\nYeah I think so. Once we, once we got into Eastcote with the door shut\nbehind us, sort of thing, yes I think so, yeah.\n\n01:41:12\n\n01:41:20\n\n01:42:53\n\nWhat was your sort of hierarchy, your commanders, like down there\nwhat were they like as people to work under in those individual bases?\nOh very good. Petty officers, leading WRENs. Petty officer and we had a\nquarters WREN officer but we didn’t, we never had a, I don’t remember a\nWREN officer being in charge of any one of the watches I think I can\nremember them being as quarters officers really but we just got on with it,\nyou know, it’s a sort of, it’s very difficult to describe what it was like because\nyou’ve got to look at it in the background of the war and the seriousness of it\nand what was going to happen if we bloody well didn’t win, you know, and I\nthink people put up with things that they think they wouldn’t put up with\nnowadays but I think they would if push came to shove. I think it’s something\nin our nature in this country in particular I think we’re sort of bloody minded I\nthink. I think that’s the only way I can put it. But it was, but it was, it was a\ngreat time, in actual fact and it certainly made me grow up. I certainly grew\nup, very much so, so that when I got demobbed, well I had a period after the\nBletchley thing where I was doing aircraft stores on a freight air arms station\nwhich I enjoyed and I could see we had one naval officer there he said, “I\ndon’t know, we’ve got these great big stores here and it’s all operated by a\ncrowd of bloody women!” laughing to him, because he was joking, you know,\nbut it’s true it was interesting and you learnt all sorts of new things there, in\nactual fact.\nWere you sad to be demobbed?\n\n\n\n\n01:42:55\n\nYes. I was. I missed it terribly, and that’s why when I trained state registered\nnurse I joined the RAF and I couldn’t join the naval nursing because you had\nto be 25 to join that and I couldn’t wait but I was back in the RAF and I can\nremember being at Halton and course then you’re an officer when you’re in\nthe Princess Mary’s Royal Air Force Nursing Service and you’d have to and\nwe’d do squad drill or something like that and I can see this RAF warrant\nofficer saying to me “When did you learn to march like that?” and I said “In\nthe Navy,” and he said “Ugh!”\n\n01:43:32\n\nI mean, how do you reflect on being a WREN I mean, how do you, what’s\nyou’re sort of under… overarching feeling about it now?\n\n01:43:44\n\nWell I’m very proud of having served in the WRENs. I’m proud of being a\nBletchley. It all seems like a dream now but it’s all sort of come out and poor\nAlan Turing, you know.\n\n01:43:55\n\nHave you met any of them since?\n\n01:43:58\n\nNo.\n\n01:43:59\n\nYou don’t want to or anything?\n\n01:44:03\n\nNo. I haven’t. Well I think the thing is because we left Harrogate, well we, we\ncame from all over the place and I very much regret that Shelia Tong who\nlater married an American war photographer and eventually went to\nGermany and I used to get letters from her and then they went back to the\nStates and I’ve never been able to contact her since, which is a pity, because\nwe were great pals.\n\n01:44:28\n\nHas your son tried?\n\n01:44:31\n\nOh yes, yes we’ve tried and my, my brother’s worked in America for BUAC\nand all sorts of things, you know it’s just, it just doesn’t and he used to work\nfor a magazine called Holiday which doesn’t exist now, but, he was a\nphotographer.\n\n01:44:50\n\nThat’s a shame, I mean she was obviously a dear pal.\n\n01:44:54\n\nOh really, yes very much so and I can always remember her saying when\nthat German bomb was overhead “Let’s get under the bedclothes!” Which we\nduly did, you know.\n\n01:45:07\n\nEnd of Films\n\n\n", "label": [[2203,

That’s my name. I was on HMS Savage, and my\nrating was Able Seaman, as I finished. I was Ordinary Seaman and Able\nSeaman. And I was Chatham Barracks rating.\n\n01:00:19\n\nWhere do you hail from? Why did you want to join the Navy?\n\n01:00:25\n\nI came from Birkenhead originally. And I joined the Navy…I don’t know, it\njust seemed the way things were, at the time, that people joined the different\nforces they fancied. And I fancied the Navy, and so that was it\n\n01:00:45\n\nWhere was that?\nWell, I went to Liverpool – Renshaw St .\nI first went, before I was 18, and they wouldn’t accept me. So they said\n’Come back again’ and I went back, and I joined then and everything was\nalright, then. And, I went down to HMS Ganges. And we done all our\ntraining, there.\n\n01:00:46\n\nIt was very strict, down there- we used to have to go swimming - early\nmorning. Before breakfast we had to go and climb over the mast. There\nwas a great, big mast there. We climbed over it. Every morning before\nbreakfast. In our shorts. (laughs)\nAnd then we went to breakfast, then, and got whatever we could and then it\nwas training all day, then.\n\n01:01:45\n\nWhere is Ganges?\n\n01:01:48\n\nIn Ipswich\n\n01:01:50\n\nHad you ever been out of Birkenhead. at that time?\n\n01:01:53\n\nNo\n\n01:01:54\n\nHow was all that transition, from being a boy to being a sailor?\n\n\n\nI don’t know, really, I think that we just accepted it.\n\n01:01:59\n\nGoing out of Birkenhead was a big thing, to me, because nobody ever\nwent…travelled far …in those days. So to travel to Ipswich! And it took all\nday. I think it was about 9 o’clock in the morning, to…I think it was 11 o’clock\nat night, when we got there.\nBecause the train was putting into different stations, and we tried to keep out\nof the way. There was air-raids going on, sometimes, during the travelling.\nYeah, we just accepted things, I think, in those days. And got on with\nwhatever you had to do.\n\n** Start of Film 2\n\n01:02:50\n\n01:02:54\n\nWhen did you get to Port Division?\nWell, you leave the Ganges and then you go to… They transfer you to\nvarious depots. Seaman’s depots, what we were in.\nWe went to Chatham Barracks then, as a Seaman.\n\n01:03:15\n\nWhat was Chatham like?\nOh. They were very strict, there. Oh, that was a terrible place.\nYou couldn’t walk across the parade ground. At any time. You had to walk\naround it - to get to the other side - you had to walk around. If you walked\nacross, somebody’d shout to you… and then you’d be on jankers, then.\n\n01:03:17\n\nI can remember one time. A Petty Officer was marching all the crew, around\nthe outside. And he didn’t salute this Gunnery Officer, that was passing. He\nshould have said-‘Eyes left!’ or ‘’right’, or whatever it was, and saluted him.\nAnd he didn’t. And this Gunnery Officer stopped him, and he said “You’ll\nreport, with your crew” he said “ after 4 o’clock, in the gymnasium. And (he\nsaid) you’ll be rigged out with…they’ll all have 28 lbs of sand on their backs.\nAnd they’ll be marching for 2 hours”\n\n01:04:41\n\n01:04:45\n\nAnd that’s what he done with us. He had us running and marching for 2 hrs,\nwith 28 lbs of sand on our backs. That was the punishment for that. Just for\nnot saluting.\nWhat was the barracks like, as a place? Was it neat and tidy, was it\nbusy?\nOh. It was a tidy place, yeah. And, if there was any air-raids you had to go\nand sleep under tunnels. Which we did, at times. There was big tunnels dug\nin the side, and we just used to go in there and sleep - wherever you could.\nI can’t remember an awful lot about Chatham Barracks, in a way.\n\n01:05:10\n\nWhat said\nHow did you feel about being a Chatham Port Division Rating?\nI suppose I was proud, in one way, to be included in it.\n\n01:05:15\n\nI suppose now we are. But at the time it was difficult - with all the disciplines.\nWe weren’t used to that kind of discipline. We were only used to household\ndiscipline, type of thing.\n\n01:05:36\n\nHow long were you at Chatham, before being given your ticket?\nWell, I should have gone to this ship that we were going on, and I was\nstopped because…. Before I went in the Navy, I’d had (erm)…pneumonia.\nSo, when I went in, they’d found this mark on my lungs and that held me\nback for a while. So I was kept in I was at Chatham Barracks, for a while\nuntil eventually I got this ship then.\nAnd then, I was sent up to Newcastle…On my own. I had to find my way with\na great, big kit bag and a hammock. I had to carry these, on and off trains, to\nget to Newcastle.\n\n01:05:41\n\nAnd then, I had to find my way to Heburn Dock Yard, which was further\ndown again - on the Tyne. And I found my way down there. And, it was an\nEngineer Officer in charge, at the time, there.\nBecause I was one of the 1st ones to go, and report. And he said ”Leave\nyour stuff here” he said “and go find yourself a digs and then come back and\ntake your stuff there”\nI had to walk around and try and find digs, while we were standing by the\nship. What they call ‘victling’- it’s taking stores on. And just generally tidying\nthe ship getting ready for the main crew.\n\n** Start of Film 3\n\n01:07:28\n\nWhat did you think when you saw the Savage?\nI don’t know really. I suppose I was amazed at the size of it.\nIt wasn’t very big, but to me it was a big ship, like, you know?.I didn’t realize\njust how big ships could get until I went on…I just went aboard one of the big\nships, somewhere.\n\n01:07:31\nI think that was in Russia. And …erm… oh that’s right we were going to look\nfor bread, in Russia. nd went on …- I can’t remember the name of the ship\nbut it was a Cruiser. We got lost on it, trying to find our way to the Galley on\nit, because they promised to give us a couple of sacks of loaves, which we\ncouldn’t get. Ours had all gone mouldy….\n01:08:24\n\nSo you were basically one of the first people on this ship, the Savage?\n\n\n\nI wouldn’t say the 1st …\nWe....I can’t remember the name of what we were called …We were, like,\nthe first… party to go, waiting for the main party to come. And we had to get\nall the stores on and get everywhere ready, cleaned down ready for the crew\nto come. And that was our main job really, as just…..\n\n01:08:27\n\n01:09:34\n\nBecause, at the time, I was doing the butchering for them. Me, and the Petty\nOfficer. I think he was called the Victling Officer - that meant getting all the\nstores on, and that was what our job was. Supplying.\nAnd then I went, being an Ordinary Seaman, when the main crew came I\nwas put with the main crew then. Just on ordinary jobs - same as anybody\nelse.\nAnd what was it like setting sail for the 1st time. Can you remember\nthat?\nWe went out. And it wasn’t very rough, and I was sea-sick then. And that’s a\nterrible thing, that is to be sea-sick. For yourself, I mean. You couldn’t care\nless, what happened to the ship…It was that bad.\n\n01:09:39\nThen after about a fortnight, I got over that then. It was OK, then - you could\nstand anything after that. Because we did have some really bad gales - on\nthe way to Russia.\n01:10:10\n\nCan you remember the chronology? What was the first thing you did\nThe first tour, the first operation on Savage Do you remember what as\nthe 1st thing you did?\nMy 1st job was in a magazine, then. Which you went down in the magazine\nand they’d batten the hatch down on you. And you’d supply the gun with the\nammunition then from there.\n\n01:10:22\n\nThat was my 1st job. And then, after that, I was also a searchlight\nmanipulator. And then I went on a 4.5 gun- on a turret gun, it was. And I was\na loader on that.\nAnd , er, you just accepted everything- I suppose- as things went\n\n** Start of Film 4\n\n01:11:07\n\nDid you know anything about the Russian convoys, at this time?\n\n\n\nYou’d hear little things, but you don’t imagine it’s as bad as it is - until you\nget there.\n\n01:11:10\n\nAnd then, when we did finally did go on one. We went to pick up some\nempties. What they called ‘empty ships’ but they were full of wood I think, as\nfar as I know. There was plenty of wood in Russia, then. Because there was\nloads of woods there, trees and that. I believe they used to cut those down to\nbuild the ships with them.\nAnd we brought them back.\n\n01:11:52\n\nAny adventures on that trip…Do you remember?\nI don’t remember much.\n\n01:11:56\n\nThe only thing that I remember, going in there, it didn’t look very nice from\nthe start. It looked a desolate place. ‘Course there’s a war on, there, and that\nhad a lot to do with it.\n\n01:12:13\n\nDid you ever get ashore? Did you go into Murmansk?\n\n01:12:16\n\nNo. We didn’t get to Murmansk. We went to Poliana , and erm …Archangel.\nJust little places, we went to.\n\n01:12:26\n\nDid you get to shore?\nWe got ashore, there, but you couldn’t go far. They wouldn’t let you go far,\nanyway.\n\n01:12:28\n\nYou always had to be standing by the ship, really, in case of air-raids.\nBecause the German airfields weren’t far away, then, in those days. I think\nthey said they were about 20 miles away, then, which wasn’t far.\n\n01:12:53\n\nDo you remember any air-raids?\n\n01:12:55\n\nNot really…. Not a lot. It was the U-boats that was our main…. ‘Distraction’.\nThey were the worse things. The U-boats.\n\n01:13:09\n\n01:13:20\n\n01:13:57\n\nWhen you were doing the convoys, you did 20. Tell us a little about\nwhat it was like to sail in 24 hour darkness, 24 hour sunshine and\nstuff?\nWe didn’t seem to get much sunshine. It always seemed to be dark, to\nme.(laughing)\nWhether that’s just the way it was I don’t know, but….if there was any\nsunshine, I think it was caused by the Northern Lights - which used to light\nthe convoy up. And that was a bit terrifying because the U-boats could see\nus, better, then. And that’s when they used to do their attacking, then. When\nit as nice and light for them, I suppose.\nWhat was the role of Savage within the convoy. What was its job?\n\n\nWell, our job was to go up and down the convoy, trying to keep the U-boats\ndown. And generally just escorting the ships.\nOne particular convoy. We were escorting this Merchant ship. It was SS\nPenelope Barker, it was called. And we used to go along- beside- each day,\nand shout instructions to it, to get a move on. Because it was always lagging\nbehind.\nAnd they said they had somebody onboard, who was ill. So our Doctor was\nshouting instructions, across the tannoy, asking questions what it was and\nhe found out that he must have had appendicitis.\nSo he’s shouting instructions. what to do. And then we carry on. And\neventually this ship got sunk. And we went in, to pick the survivors up. And\nyou throw scrambling nets over the side.\n\n01:14:02\n\nIt’s pretty dark, but you had a little light on you (indicates his jacket lapel).\nRed light. And people’d go down the scrambling net, to try and help them get\nin as quick as you can, to get away. And they’re helping them all up as quick\nas they can.\nAnd this one one fellow came up and said, “Where’s your sick bay” and\nsomeone told him where it was. ‘I’m the one with appendicitis” and he’s\nbeen swimming - from his ship to us, and just casually (laughing) “I’m the\none with appendicitis’. And went on his way\nAnd then, another one, another survivor, he got hold of the netting - and he\nwouldn’t let go of it But by then we’d picked up as many as we could and we\nhad to go because we got a ping on the ASDIC to say there’s a U-boat\nabout.\nSo we had to go and he wouldn’t let go of this scrambling net. And he started\nsinging. And of course the speed of us going - and he’s just swinging with\nit…Banging and singing…. And eventually he went and then we came back\nlater on to try and pick more survivors up- but we didn’t find any. But the\ncold’s so severe you don’t last long, anyway.\n\n01:16:39\n\nWere you actually involved in helping them?\n\n01:16:42\n\nAs many as you can. You always keep one side of the erm, erm, (can’t\nremember the names of the things) And the other parties go and try and help\n- to do what they can.\n\n01:16:58\n\nHow long are you allowed to do this kind of rescue?\n\n01:17:04\n\nWell, you do it as quickly as you can, actually. The quicker you can get them\non board, the better. Because the quicker you can get away, then. Because\nthe U-boats, sometimes, would hang about. Knowing that someone would\ncome to pick them up. And they’d sink the ship that’s come to pick them up\n\n01:17:25\n\n01:17:31\n\n01:18:10\n\nWhat said\nWhen this Penelope is being hit. Did you see her go down. Was it an\nexplosion…?\nIt’s just a big light, and all on fire, and she went down. And the water’s on\nfire, because the oil’s on fire. And, these men are trying to swim through it.\nOh it’s a terrible sight to see it. It’s still in my mind now. And sometimes you\nget very upset when you think of it, you know. (Saddened) I suppose it was\njust a job and you just get on with it. You’re with all your mates and you’re\njust trying to push it out of your mind, and go on.\nWhat was Savage like, was it a like a happy ship. Did you have a good\ntime?\nWell it was quite a good ship, I found, and a good crew.\n\n01:18:13\n\nI never wanted to leave it. I would be asked to go on a course. But then, if\nyou went on a course, you would leave the ship completely. And I didn’t\nwant to leave it, really.\nBut you don’t know you’re going to do all these convoys, then. You just go\nwhere the ship goes. That’s all you’re doing, is following the ship.\n\n** Start of Film 5\n\n01:18:46\n\nI guess 1 of the big moments in the Savage’s Convoy experience was\nthe sinking of the Scharnhorst Can you remember what you did\npersonally on that day?\nWhat happened was…We were escorting the Duke of York, and a Cruiser.\n\n01:18:58\n\nAnd we were told that the Scharnhorst was coming out. We’d had reports to\nsay, off the Norwegian Coast, that she was coming out. And she did come\nout, then, and….\n\n01:19:23\n\nWhen you say ‘we were told’. Was your Captain telling you this?\n\n\n\nYeah. We get reports of what’s happening. He said “The Scharnhorst is out\nwith 4 Destroyers, and we’re on the look-out for her”.\nThe Scharnhorst Is attacking the convoy but the crews with the convoy are\nkeeping the Scharnhorst away from them. And they’re reporting to the Duke\nof York, who’s in charge of the whole operation, of what’s happening.\nAnd eventually, we’re coming up - to attack the Scharnhorst then. But she’s\ngetting away from the escorts of the Convoy, and she’s getting away from\nthem and\nso we’re trying to pull her into a trap, where the Duke of York would be able\nto fire on it, which did happen eventually.\nAnd the Duke of York sent us to tea early, because she said we’d be\napproaching the Scharnhorst at a certain time. I think it was 6 o’clock, I’m not\nsure –or, 1800 hours =like- as they say then.\n\n01:19:27\n\nSo, we had our tea and then we went to action stations, then, and we\nstopped at action stations until the Duke of York got the Scharnhorst on the\nradar. And she fired the firsts salvo, then, at the Scharnhorst And, I didn’t\nknow whether she hit it at first, or whether she straddled it. And then the\nScharnhorst started firing back.\nAnd my mate on the range finder said ‘Have a look at this’ So I looked\nthrough, and I could see the Scharnhorst but there was star-shell above it,\nwhich was lighting it up.\nAnd so, then the Duke of York said ‘she’s getting away from us’. So she sent\nthe 4 destroyers, which was us and the Stored and the Stormrays and the\nScorpion and we went in to attack it, then.\nAnd 2 Destroyers went down each side of her - firing torpedoes, at it. And we\nfired our torpedoes. And as we’re going in to fire our torpedoes, the\nScharnhorst is firing at us. And you could hear the shrapnel on the gun\nturret. And we went in, and fired our torpedoes. And we came out.\nAnd, as we were coming out we went to attack a destroyer, which we\nthought was a German destroyer. And it happened to be the Stormrays,\nwhich had been hit. The Scharnhorst had hit her with some fire and we went\nto attack it. But then we realized what it was, and we helped her to get back,\nthen, into Russia. We escorted her back into Russia, then.\n\n01:23:02\n\nWhat’s that noise you talk about? You’re in the turret and obviously\nyou can’t see anything except through the finders. But you could hear\nthe shell, breaking above?\n\n\n\nYou could hear…\nOne of the after-guns- that was an open gun. And they were firing. And 1 of\ntheir crew had his helmet blown off. Which he didn’t know at the time- it just\ncame off.\n\n01:23:14\n\nAnd after we’d finished and come out, he went to look for his tin hat and\nthere was a big hole in it. Something like that, (indicating, a size of it) I think\nit was. And, I believe he kept that as a souvenir – because the shrapnel must\nhave gone through it, and missed his head and just knocked helmet off.\nAnd he was alright! (Laughs)\n\n01:24:01\n\n01:24:04\n\nDid you see the Scharnhorst go down?\nNo. I didn’t see that. By then, it was all lit up. It was all on fire and lit up, and\ngone down. And we came out.\nI’ve got all the survivors names ….\n\n01:24:23\n\nThere weren’t many were there?\n\n01:24:25\n\nNo. I can’t remember how many. I’ve got them, there (indicates beside him),\nanyway….\n\n01:24:30\n\nWhat’s the feeling on the ship like, after such a big battle like that?\nOh, it was a big relief. Well, I don’t think we realized what we had done,\nactually . I think you think “Oh we’ve sunk a ship” and that’s it.\n\n01:24:33\n\nBut, it was a big thing and you just feel a big sense of relief, that she’s gone.\nBecause they only had the Tapit after that, which was a menace to the\nconvoys.\nOnce the Scharnhorst had gone, of course we think ‘there’s Destroyers\nabout’, but there weren’t. They’d gone back in\n\n01:25:16\n\nWhat were you doing, you talk about the view finder. What was your\nrole in all this? What can you hear and whats being told to you?\nAs you’re going in - to fire your torpedoes, they’re telling you the range. The\nrange is coming down all the time “3000 yds. 2500, 2000 yds.” Or whatever it\nwas. I can’t remember the exact words now…\n\n01:25:23\n\nIt’s coming over, all the time. And we’d stopped firing, because we’d given\nour position away, you know? You just go in - And fire our torpedoes….\nI suppose the men in the torpedo firing parts, were the worse – because they\nwere all in the open. We were not so bad - we were in turrets.\n\n01:26:15\n\nAre you firing a gun, or a torpedo?\n\n\n\n\n01:26:16\n\nWe were firing the guns – 4.5 guns, we had. My job was to load it with\ncordite. I’d put the cordite in and the next one, to me, he’d turn round and put\nthe shell in.\nAnd then we’d push the tray over. And….Just fire it then…\n\n01:26:42\n\nWhat’s the noise and the impact like, then?\nIt was just all excitement, to do…\n\n01:26:45\n\nWhen you’re waiting to fire, that is the worse part. You’re all tensed up and\nyour nerves are going…Everything’s going…Until you fire. And its not too\nbad after that… You just keep going\n\n01:27:05\n\nIs it loud?\nNo, it’s not too bad, actually.\n\n01:27:06\n\nI suppose it was loud ……but we didn’t realize. Me being deaf, now, I don’t\nknow\n\n01:27:17\n\nThat maybe to do with the guns…..\n\n** Start of Film 6\n\n01:27:21\n\nHave you got any particular memories of the cold, the snow, the ice?\n\n\n\nOne particular time…. I had 2 pairs of gloves on. And we dashed to action\nstations. And as we go - to fire - my hand got trapped. Because my hand\nwas that cold - and these gloves on..\nAnd the pressure was pulling my glove off..and I thought it was pulling my\nhand off, because it was that cold. And I as screaming my head offfrightened, scared stiff.\nAnyway it pulled the glove off, and I was all right then. It just damaged my\nhand a bit\nBut the cold was terrific up there. You couldn’t touch anything metal. You\nalways had to wear gloves, really.\nAnd the seas! You can talk about seas all day, but you can’t…. You can’t\nimagine what it’s like - to climb up a wave, like that, (indicates a steep,\nvertical climb) like you’re going up a hill. And you see all the convoy.\n\n01:27:25\n\nAnd you go down, and you can’t see a thing. Just like climbing up – I don’t\nknow – like Mt Everest, I think. Oh. They were terrible seas there. The\npeople that’s been there will be able to tell you this. I’m not exaggerating, at\nall, on that.\nBut the cold! And the ice! You had to go chipping ice. Every half hour everything that was movable had to be chipped.\nAnd, when the bow went down, into the wave- like that (indicates) and the\nspray had come up…(indicating) … And if you were on the Bridge..It hit you,\nlike a little piece of… the spray would hit you, like a little piece of ice. That’s\nhow cold it was.\nBy the time it’s left the sea - come up on the Bridge, and hit you - it’s a piece\nof ice That’s how cold it was.\nAnd you go down into your mess deck. to get a warm. And we had a little 1\nbar fire like that- an electric fire that had to heat …A big area. And all the\ndeck head was covered in ice, and all along the sides were all wet, with the\ndamp. All your clothes were always wet. I don’t know how we survived, really\n\n01:30:11\n\nHow did you stay warm?\n\n\n\nYou didn’t take your clothes off. When you come off Watch, you just flopped\ndown- on the deck, in the water, anywhere. If there was a table free, you lay\ndown on the table. Or the long stools – you lay on them.\n\n01:30:12\n\nSome people said they used to sling hammocks, but we didn’t. Becausehammocks really, then, were made for shoring-up holes. If you were holed\nthe hammocks were a help. Because, the way they were strung, the way\nyou tied your hammock up. That was the reason for it, really, was to plug a\nhole in the ship’s side.\nAnd, the cold though!…. I just can’t get over it, now, how we survived it.\n\n01:31:09\n\nWere the heads warm?\n\n01:31:11\n\nYou’d get washed off those, if you weren’t careful. You had to hang on.\n(Laughing) You’d get washed, through the....because there wasn’t much\nstopping you. It was all open. All your toilets were all open, then, in the after\ndeck\n\n01:31:27\n\nSo in big seas you had to be very careful?\n\n01:31:29\n\nYeah The water would come over the toilet and wash you off. I suppose it\nwas the first Jacuzzi…\n\n01:31:39\n\nBidet?\n\n01:31:40\n\nBidet….\n\n** Start of Film 7\n\n01:31:41\n\nYou talk about being washed off. Did any of your crew mates ever get\nwashed off?\nYeah. There’s one, there, actually (indicates, papers next to him) – he was\nwashed overboard..\nThere was two. Two of them washed overboard. They tried to make a dash\nfor it, from the after-end, forward. Their duty was up, on the Bridge. They\nmade a dash for it, but they got washed under the guard rail.\n\n01:31:46\nAnd one of them hung on to the guard rail… and the other one went. He\nmanaged to get up, and get up onto the Bridge and shout ‘man overboard’\nBut by the time we’d turned around…. It was pitch dark anyway. By the\ntime we’d turned around and went back, there’s no sign of him.\nSo, that’s his Memorial Card, over there.\n01:32:36\n\nHow does that affect the ship?\n\n01:32:38\n\nOh it does affect you. It sets you back a bit. Everyone’s a bit down for a\nwhile.\n\n\n\n01:32:46\n\nWas he a mate of yours?\n\n01:32:48\n\nNot a mate. I knew him, like, but not an actual mate\n\n01:32:53\n\nWhat was your Skipper like?\nOh. We had a good Skipper. Well we had a few Skippers- but this one during\nthe Scharnhorst battle he was very good.\nSome of them was…what’s the word for it now? – “knowing” - what crew\nneeds. Whereas some of them would be in pre-war days, still. In discipline.\nYou know, the discipline was very strict on some ships. We weren’t too bad.\nAt sea we could wear anything.\n\n01:32:56\n\nWhich you did, you wore any old clothes- at sea. As you can tell from some\nof the photographs I’ve got, at sea. Actually- our main thing was a boilersuit. That seemed to keep you warm, because you were wrapped up in it.\nThe first trip I made, though, we didn’t have any warm clothing. I just had\nmy ordinary dress coat, which we used to go ashore with. That’s all I wore\nuntil I got a duffle coat, then, which we used to pass around.\nAs you come off Watch you swapped it, with someone else to go on Watch\nwith. And then eventually we got duffel coats, then.\n\n01:34:27\n\nWhen you’re doing these legs, obviously your sailing into Russia, then\nyou’ve got to do the return leg. Did you have a preference- going East\nor West?\nErm? Not really, no. We just didn’t think much about it, at the time. You just\ndone what came your way, type of thing.\nWe just brought empties back. Sometimes we didn’t bring any empties back,\nwe just dashed back again, and picked another convoy up.\n\n01:34:39\n\nBecause, sometimes they used to run 3 convoys. All the escort would be\nwith the 1st one - and get that into Russia. And then they’d all come out and\nmeet the second one, which was already on its way. And then get that in.\nAnd that’s how we done it. One after the other. That was near the end of the\nconvoys.\n\n01:35:29\n\nDid you ever see any U boats? Sink a U-boat?\n\n\n\nNo. We didn’t see any. We’d go in to attack U-boat. Many a time, we’d attack\nthem, which we thought were U-boats Drop depth charges….\nNo. We didn’t see any, but…One of the trips we done was… 2 Destroyers,\nlike us and another one, went dropping depth charges. Every so often, we\ndropped depth charges. And the Convoy turned off.\n\n01:35:32\nSo the U-boat followed our depth charge noise, for so long. We done this for\nso many hours, and then we…We had the speed. So we had to dash away,\nthen, and catch up with the Convoy, hoping the U-boats had followed us,\naway.\nAnd, that was one… 1 good thing we done, I suppose\n01:36:06\n\nWhat about Stukka bombers?\nWe weren’t too bad, really. We always had the .. the aircraft used to fly\nround us, giving…They used to give out signals to the U-boats, as to where\nwe were. They were signaling all the time to them.\n\n01:36:28\n\nAnd, they were signaling the Convoy - and we couldn’t do much about it.\nUntil, one time we had a carrier with us and they sent all the planes off. And\nas soon as they see the planes coming off, they’d go up into the clouds and\ngo away.\nAnd all the aircraft, then, come and land back on the aircraft carrier- except\ntwo. And they kept out of the way.\nThen, as soon as this German plane came back in, they attacked him and\nshot him down. So that was one good…..\n\n01:37:32\n\nDid you watch it?\n\n01:37:34\n\nYou can’t really see much, it’s too dark. Even in the daylight, its dark there,\n\n01:37:41\n\nHow did you find that sort of 24 hr. darkness?\nFunnily enough, we used to keep to the time, as well. Can’t remember what\nyou call it now, when you go over the time…You’d have to put…\n\n01:37:46\n\nIf the time is going ahead 1 hour, we’d have to do half hour on - extra. And\nthe other crew would do half hour coming on. So that’s how we used to catch\nour hour up, by doing extra time on the Watch.\nWe didn’t think much about it really - the time limit - we just seemed to\naccept things. I think we were disciplined that much, in those days, you just\ncarried on.\n\n\n01:38:39\n\nWhat said\nDid you find that towards the end of the War the convoys got easier?\nOh, yeah. They definitely got easier.\n\n01:38:42\n\nThe first convoys, to go, must have been really bad - especially that PQ17,\none.\nJeremy Clarkson was telling me about that. I just met him at that ‘do’ there…\nHe was telling me about what he’d done….\n\n01:39:03\n\nSo you didn’t do any of the PQ’s then?\nNo, No. The JWs and RAs…We didn’t know what they were called, then.\nThey were just convoys to us.\n\n01:39:09\n\nThe Morrassa – she got sunk, a Destroyer, with us. We picked up some\nsurvivors up off that one. The Hardy was another one. She got sunk. We\ndidn’t pick survivors up off her, somebody else done that.\nThe Lapwing - we picked survivors up off that one. And she got sunk\n\n01:39:45\n01:39:51\n\nDid you remember any of these people Were you involved in some of\nthis work?\nNot really no. We’d be at action stations and other people would be doing\nthat\nEnd of FIlms\n\n\n", "label": [[2192, 2214, "PERSON"], [2241, 2251, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [2271, 2282, "RANK"], [2348, 2364, "LOCATION"], [2305, 2320, "RANK"], [2325, 2336, "RANK"], [2466, 2476, "LOCATION"], [2506, 2510, "ORGANISATION"], [2646, 2650, "ORGANISATION"], [2714, 2723, "LOCATION"], [2726, 2736, "LOCATION"], [2919, 2929, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [3370, 3377, "LOCATION"], [3613, 3623, "LOCATION"], [3719, 3726, "LOCATION"], [3956, 3965, "EVENT"], [4201, 4207, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [4310, 4326, "LOCATION"], [4338, 4344, "RANK"], [4702, 4715, "RANK"], [4789, 4804, "RANK"], [4931, 4946, "RANK"], [5489, 5498, "EVENT"], [5701, 5717, "LOCATION"], [5781, 5809, "RANK"], [6096, 6103, "LOCATION"], [6247, 6251, "ORGANISATION"], [6394, 6410, "LOCATION"], [6490, 6499, "LOCATION"], [6624, 6633, "LOCATION"], [6736, 6740, "LOCATION"], [6680, 6696, "LOCATION"], [6788, 6804, "RANK"], [7554, 7560, "LOCATION"], [7624, 7630, "LOCATION"], [7697, 7704, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [8362, 8375, "RANK"], [8403, 8419, "RANK"], [8528, 8543, "RANK"], [9106, 9112, "LOCATION"], [9525, 9548, "RANK"], [9571, 9578, "EQUIPMENT"], [9585, 9595, "EQUIPMENT"], [9617, 9623, "RANK"], [10090, 10096, "LOCATION"], [9968, 9975, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [10622, 10630, "LOCATION"], [10643, 10650, "LOCATION"], [10662, 10671, "LOCATION"], [10896, 10905, "EVENT"], [10919, 10925, "NATIONALITY"], [11136, 11143, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [11211, 11218, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [11681, 11688, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [11953, 11960, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [12053, 12066, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [12075, 12093, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [12591, 12606, "EQUIPMENT"], [13336, 13341, "EQUIPMENT"], [13359, 13365, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [14182, 14189, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [15572, 15584, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [15638, 15649, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [12751, 12765, "EQUIPMENT"], [13420, 13434, "EQUIPMENT"], [15592, 15599, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [15699, 15714, "LOCATION"], [15908, 15919, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [15934, 15944, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [15986, 15997, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [16068, 16079, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [16125, 16137, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [16248, 16259, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [16409, 16421, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [16488, 16500, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [16564, 16575, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [16792, 16804, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [16813, 16824, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [16884, 16895, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [16986, 16997, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [17038, 17050, "RANK"], [17119, 17130, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [17209, 17221, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [17275, 17285, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [17308, 17314, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [17323, 17332, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [17341, 17349, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [17391, 17401, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [17533, 17544, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [17601, 17611, "EQUIPMENT"], [17718, 17727, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [17752, 17758, "NATIONALITY"], [17759, 17768, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [17796, 17805, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [17831, 17842, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [17972, 17978, "LOCATION"], [18006, 18012, "LOCATION"], [18251, 18259, "EQUIPMENT"], [19418, 19423, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [19480, 19491, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [19530, 19540, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [20316, 20324, "EQUIPMENT"], [20361, 20368, "EQUIPMENT"], [20382, 20389, "EQUIPMENT"], [21966, 21976, "LOCATION"], [25060, 25067, "RANK"], [25087, 25095, "RANK"], [25121, 25139, "EVENT"], [25121, 25132, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [25564, 25574, "EQUIPMENT"], [26276, 26283, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [26320, 26327, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [26510, 26516, "LOCATION"], [26813, 26819, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [26874, 26881, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [26887, 26900, "EQUIPMENT"], [26962, 26972, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [27013, 27026, "EQUIPMENT"], [27055, 27068, "EQUIPMENT"], [27114, 27120, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [27300, 27307, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [27547, 27554, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [27727, 27734, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [27920, 27936, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [28002, 28008, "NATIONALITY"], [29000, 29015, "PERSON"], [29282, 29290, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [29309, 29318, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [29378, 29383, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [29481, 29488, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [2437, 2441, "ORGANISATION"], [3348, 3354, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [3414, 3424, "LOCATION"], [4166, 4179, "LOCATION"], [4366, 4373, "LOCATION"], [7274, 7280, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [7955, 7961, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [9229, 9235, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [9762, 9769, "NATIONALITY"], [10580, 10588, "LOCATION"], [11079, 11088, "EVENT"], [11840, 11846, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [14373, 14381, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [14895, 14901, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [15416, 15424, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [15466, 15477, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [15824, 15831, "RANK"], [18765, 18776, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [25028, 25035, "RANK"], [26048, 26054, "LOCATION"], [26742, 26749, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [26758, 26764, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [27403, 27417, "VEHICLE_PLANE"]]}

And\nI run away from home you see and I was a good swimmer and I just to do a\nlot of high diving in and what have you at the place we had here which is now\ngone and you know the water drew me somehow. So one night I just packed\nmy kit and left home and I had a bit of a struggle to get into the navy because\nI wasn’t quite the age they would of liked but, anyway they put me into the\nGanges and the other lads had just been sent up across the water to the Isle\nof Man because they were being bombed you see and I was the only one\nthat went in as I were and came out at the end I done well. I’d been in the\nHome Guard as a younger man and done all my machine gunning and bomb\nthrowing in the home guard and course I got a good start on everything.\nExplosives didn’t bother me or frighten me of nothing. So yeah I enjoyed it,\nI loved it.\n\n01:42:21\n\nAnd what was it like then Ganges why did you enjoy it so much?\nWell I wasn’t there long because as soon as I got there the first thing you\nhave to do is put a wetsuit on and you have to swim the length of the pond\nand back and until you can do that and you don’t get away but, I was a good\nhigh diver because not far from here there used to be a high diving board\nand I’m red hot at diving and consequently I was straight out and I had to do\na couple of little runs up to Scotland and do some work up there with other\nchaps and one way and another I was seen to be doing jobs on little boats\nback and forth up to Scotland. Several of us was doing it and the next thing\nI decided I would I was in Chatham you see I decided I would study a bit in\nthere, I done all in the Home Guard I’d done all my rifle work and everything\nand was red hot with machine gun, in Wellingborough and I was a very fit\nman you know but, anyway after you pass what you want to do when you\nleave there… I wanted to be a Torpedoman you see so I joined the Torpedo\npart and that actually didn’t suit me when I got in there that didn’t but, anyway\nI got in and got out. And then another chap sat with me we both passed out\nand went into jobs in the dockyard basically until we got a ship.\n\n01:03:29\n\nIs this at Chatham?\n\n\n\nNo this is at… yeah Chatham sorry I’m getting mixed up and soon as that\nhappened we messed about a little bit in the dockyard doing work and then\nthe Savage she was down on the where all the trouble was down south she\ncame flying back because she was desperately needed to go up to\nMurmansk run and me and the chap were in there we both went aboard her\nand got picked up and took her to Scapa Flow and that was it and of course\nwe done one after the other up there.\n\n01:04:31\n\nWhat do you remember of the Chatham Dockyard what was it like as a\nplace for a young boy?\nWell I mean I was a young boy and I thought everything was wonderful…\nactually the first thing I did because the Savage hadn’t come up then she was\ndown just finishing down where the battle was going on and they sent me in\nthe dockyard to do a job until the ship come up you see and I was in that\nsubmarine… I had to go in that submarine that was in dry dock that had\nfooled the Germans and the Spaniards when they put that dead body in the\nChannel between them… do you remember it. Well they fooled the Germans\nthat it was a German that had been… they actually put a body… they got a\ndead mans body a genuine dead mans body from up north and they put it\ninto this submarine and they actually dressed it all up… as a man trying to\ntake information to the Spaniards in you know on the coastline. And they\nsunk it they took this dead body and bound it and done it all made it all look\nsmart in a uniform. Not service uniform but, in clothing and they put a thing\non his arm with a great big attaché case with dummy information of what was\nhappening because he was supposed to be a German Spy you see. It’s a\nfilm it’s fantastic. Anyway that little submarine that I had to go and work on\nhad just come back from taking the body and floating it in the Spanish\nCoastline to drift ashore and they dressed it all up as one of their sort not\nours you know and it all worked.\n\n** Start of Film 2\n\n01:06:37\n\nWhat was it like going into the Savage for the first time, you know your\nfirst proper draft can you remember?\n\n\n\nWell I’ll tell you what it were she was down on the battlefront and she was\ncalled away because she was needed for this… and we were down there\ntorpedo course and were having to work in the dockyard during the day time\nand then vittles in the canteen at night and anyway we got piped for and we\nboth got told to get our kit ready and take it in the dockyard and the Savage\ncame in from being down at the bank where they had been fighting and she’d\nbeen pulled right up and they were loading her up with stuff and alongside\nand we got called and put aboard her and that’s as quick as that but, I’ll tell\nyou what the bloke that was with me he died not about three weeks ago and\nwe’re both together you see and we both took the course together and we\nboth got put on the Savage. She came in, in the afternoon and pulled\nalongside and god it was murder they were having to do all sorts of things\nbecause we’ve got to race up with this big convoy what was coming from\nCanada and already there was loads up in North Scotland waiting for the\nconvoy to move or… and this well we knew it. Well anyway they piped for\nus two and we went on to the window where they tell you where you were\ngoing and they sent us straight to the Savage in the dockyard and what the\nSavage was having to do was take on ammunition and everything else and\nit was pouring with bloody rain at night it bucketed down and we had to go\ndown further down the coast because we joined it and when we went on we\nwere there forever we’d been drafted to her which was alright.\n\n01:08:54\n\nBut, we went done to when it got dark… we went down to the ammunition\nplace which was a long way down the water from us and it was bucketing\ndown and god blimey we had an ammunition ship in the dark and it was and\nyou went along this pipe not pipes boards and they were springing up and\ndown carrying stuff out pitch black and this ship was shipping water it was\nraining so hard anyway we’re all carrying stuff up along the landing you know\nto fill her up with ammunition and that and we sailed from there at midnight\nup between Ireland and that to join this here big convoy and you’d never see\nit rain like it god almighty I was a lookout and my mate was on the other side\nof the bridge in the look out and we was bloody soaked to the skin pitch black\nand of course we had to put all new ammunition on her before we could sail\nfrom there because that was where the ammunition bunkers were down there\nanyway we got up in the early hours of the morning we reached Liverpool\nthat area and then it started to lighted up a bit but, it never left off driving rain\nand we went right the way up to the North where we got to pick this convoy\nup and they were all more or less ready to sail. It was the biggest convoy of\nthe war.\n\n\n\n01:10:28\n\nWhat is said\nAnd every type of ship was there and course we joined her and I mean I’ve\nnever been to bloody sea you didn’t know where you were because we hadn’t\nbeen trained for it. I thought it was too quick but, anyway we managed alright\nme and me mate. The first thing were you were all mixed up because the\nship shipping water all the way and I went down into the front of the ship and\nit was half full of water and it was half full of water and it was shipping over\nthe top you see it was one of the worst storms of the war running up that\ncoast and… but, anyway I don’t mind admitting it I felt so bloody sick going\nup to Russia I wasn’t too bad going through the channel as I said but, when\nwe actually got going I thought cor blimey I got billeted they hadn’t got room\nfor us down in the main place and I thought I felt as sick as a dog so I cleared\nmyself and went up and they got the aft gun turret looking forehead so it was\nopen to the direction we were going on the back of the gun shield and it had\ncurtains… heavy curtains that go over because they had no doors or anything\nbehind them and I slept there all night I did… all night Christ I did feel ill and\nmy mate he was somewhere else I don’t know where he went but, I was\nnever sick again. Well I wasn’t sick I felt sick but, I was never like it again\nbut, I’d always been a good swimmer and everything you know and diver I\nwas good at diving so why that ship upset me like that I didn’t know but, I\nstopped in there until we got two days away from here as you might say and\nI never looked back.\n\n** Start of Film 3\n\n01:12:43\n\nThe Savage was a well-oiled ship she wasn’t got a depth under water like an\nup and down engine ones she had electric turbines steam turbines made all\nthe electric but she didn’t draw half as much under the water as an ordinary\ndestroyer or and ordinary sloop which was proved on the last day of the war\nof the convoy and we were all waited outside to go through the mountain gap\ninto the Russian end and a U-boat was waiting for us and we were all there\nand the convoy was coming in and it’s on the telly sometimes. Convoy was\ncoming in and spreading about but, the Germans were waiting underneath\nthe cliff bottoms and you could only go into the dockyard through and\nentrance not much wider than that with two great pillars of coastline so you\nhad to go in one at a time and the big liberty ships used to squeeze through\nit anyway this was the last convoy of the war and we were hanging about\nthere as the ships were coming in with stuff to take in and this u-boat was\nlaying under the rocks opposite us. It was snowing in the morning when we\ntook up our position to cover them as they come in because they got liberty\nships with them you know with railway engines on them and that from\nAmerica.\n\n\n\n\n01:14:35\n\nAnd the first thing that happened one of them got torpedoed as it went to go\nthrough the opening into the harbour where you go up further to it because\nthe ship broke in half and sunk in the gateway, well we called it a gateway\ncause there’s chaos then because the rest of the flotilla… their flotilla and the\npeople we brought up were coming in to this big opening where we were all\nwaiting for the others to go in and we were all ready for everything. Me and\nmy mate were put down below to push the depth charges up hook them on\nand then they were pulling them up ready to go. We never heard a torpedo\ncoming or I didn’t but, the others on deck did they could hear it coming but,\nthey didn’t know where it was and it went under the Savage and it hit a brand\nnew ship just as far away as the other side of the road. And everyone was\npractically killed on it… it sunk like that brand new but, why didn’t it hit the\nSavage?\n\n01:15:49\n\nShallow draft…?\nShallow draft yeah she had flat engines that were driven by shafts that way\nright at the bottom and they drove these two generators. I used to go down\none of my jobs as you go down every morning and check all the things that\ncould of stopped it and make sure everything was alright… that was one of\nmy jobs you see and I used to stand there and watch because what they\nwere there was no propellers what they were on the bigger ships that were\nright low down weren’t they it was only drawing half as much water as one of\nthem and that torpedo went under us and it hit the other ship on the other\nside and we picked some of the men up six… we buried one we went in. we\nwere fighting until dark out there all the rest of the ships and you see this\nliberty ship they hit it with a torpedo and it blocked the entrance you see and\nthen it went down in the entrance.\n\n01:16:59\n\nI mean how do you get rid of that can you remember?\n\n\n\nWell I don’t know because it was up to the Russians to do their own work on\nthat. So we were fighting until dark at night and it was snowing at eight in\nthe morning when we started until it got dark and we buried one chap. It was\nquite dusk getting dark and we buried him and we had to go right up nrth\nfuther to come in another way from the north and down inside the water\nbecause we couldn’t get in you see. It was terrible, it was the last convoy of\nthe war and when came out they had opened that up the Russians had. It\nwas Christmas… we had Christmas Day there and we were there for two or\nthree days and when we come out we could come out that way and we came\nout at midnight two of us and we had to go north run up the coastline and the\nother one… no we went south and the other one went north listening for UBoats and while we were there we were dropping the convoy was ready to\ncome out empties all ready to come out and we were sent each way us and\nthe other one to keep anything down you see and try and find if anything was\nthere and whilst we were doing this the convoy came out in the pitch black\nand by the time it got light in the morning they were well away from where\nwe were. So we had to catch them up you see and which we did and she\ncame home alright never had no problems.\n\n** Start of Film 4\n\n01:18:48\n\nAfter the convoys of the arctic then you didn’t stay on the Savage very\nlong didn’t you?\nWell I stayed on the Savage until the German surrender and we came back\ndown to Chatham, at Chatham Barracks in the dockyard and I was sent for\nbecause as you see I was a volunteer. I joined underage hence it made me\na volunteer not a conscripted man we came down to the Chatham Dockyard\nI got sent to the place added in you in and out and I had to pack my kit and\nthe next morning I was put on a train with hundreds more in the dockyard\nlocked in with keys and they take them out so you can’t get out and this train\nwent straight of flying down to Southampton we got out and there was a\nbloody great liner there waiting for us all full of people going to the Far East\nand she was due to sail at half past eight and it was half past six then and\nyou couldn’t get on anywhere for people it was a bloody great American liner,\ncan’t think of the name there was two of them made but, anyway we sailed\nthat night within two hours we were on the water going out and that took us\nright out to Ceylon and that’s where we were took off there. Don’t know\nwhere she went from there because she was loaded to the top with… we had\nto stop before we could go through the Canal to get out to… because by the\ntime we got there it was pitch black and we went on from there down the next\nmorning through the Canal which was such a big ship and the next thing we\nwent right out to Ceylon and that’s when they bumped us off…\n\n01:20:55\n\nWas there any… do you remember anything of that troop ship?\n\n\n\nThere wasn’t no room for us on the top deck and the gale god it blowing a\nbloody gale and all our kit had been left down below where it had been\ndumped and there was a load of women on there in uniforms and that and\nwe had to sleep on the open top deck and it was bloody freezing and we went\nthrough the Canal. Went right out and then straight out to Ceylon and they\ndumped us\n\n01:21:32\n\nPretty incredible really when you think you know one minute you’re in\nPolyarny in a battle and then two days later…\nThat’s right that’s how quick it was they were waiting for troops you see and\nshe was full that ship. They had two of them.\n\n01:21:49\n\nDid you have any fear of going to the Far East?\nNo I didn’t know what it was like did I. I mean I had a feeling what it might\nbe like but, I didn’t… I wanted it you see that’s why I runway and joined the\nnavy. I wanted the navy and when that all came well I was on top of the\nworld. She was a nice ship but, I never had done any minesweeping or\nnothing and she was not a Chatham ship you see but, everybody else we got\non like a house on fire but, this one bloke and he was in the same mess as\nme he used to sit opposite me at the table and I don’t know why he took to\nme but, anyway he found out I was a Chatham man and that’s how I think\nstarted it. I shouldn’t of been there really but, everybody else we were like\nbricks together but, he where we used to go down to sleep below if we wasn’t\nin any danger we used to go down there and down there you’ve got another\nmess deck and your hammocks down there if you can. And he was in the\nsame mess as me sitting opposite me and he just used to sneer at me and I\nnever had a bloody enemy on that ship and they made me Chief\nQuartermaster and they didn’t like that you see and that give me quite a run\nof the ship and then the captain had me up in his cabin and he had a chat\nwith me and he told me what he’d like me to do and it was nice. I mean I\nwas in charge of the steerage which means the other chaps are under me\nstraight away but, I’ve never steered a bloody ship but, I had to and I mean\nit hasn’t got a compass like where you see the hands going… you’ve got\nnumbers flicking backward and forwards and you’ve got to read them but, we\ndid have one of the old ones.\n\n01:24:04\n\nWhat about this ship the Japanese ship that you were escorting tell me\nabout that?\n\n\n\nWell that was the biggest of their cruisers don’t ask me the name I can’t tell\nyou but, it was the biggest one they had and she’d been bombed and she lay\nin the harbour and we used go by her every time we went in or out but, we\nthought she was on the bottom but, she wasn’t but, anyway it was one of the\nbiggest Japanese ships and it had been bombed and it had been in\nSingapore Harbour for quite some time since it was his but, anyway\nunbeknown they were making it ready to tow it and sink it you see and we\ngot chose to do it and we were coming on our way home as it happened. We\nleft Singapore a tug with her… two tugs with her actually and she was a\nmassive ship and she’d been emptied and everything and it had got dark and\nwe’re coming up the Malacca Straits and we got to this point where she was\nsupposed to of been sunk, the deepest water because she was the biggest\none they had at the time and consequently it was pitch black and we’re on\nour way to come home you see. It come to midnight and two Japanese tugs\nthat were towing her, had been towing her right out on… as far as that big\nhouse there from us but, they were coming up the coastline and we were\nfurther out where we could keep an eye on her and everything and as I say\nit got pitch black and by the time we got to the point which we had a compass\nreading which we’d got to sink her on.\n\n01:26:08\n\n01:27:31\n\nThey started the ship coming up and left her they bolted and left the ship with\nno head way and she come half way up to where she was supposed to be\nsunk and I expect our captain got permission to sink her but, it was midnight\npitch black and we had our search light on her and they vanish into the black\nand gone and of course she’s drifted. Well she wouldn’t drift far you know\nshe’s a massive ship but, she’s only just off the coastline as we saw her pitch\nblack and I’m still on the bloody wheel and of course looking out of the\nwheelhouse because we weren’t going we were just hovering. And then I\nsuppose the captain got in touch with their people and they said what to do\nso we had to send men over with depth charges because we carried depth\ncharges and they’ve got to put the depth charges as low as possible in the\nship because there is nobody on there and I mean it was massive and they’d\ngot to wire everything up and all we could do was use our depth charges and\ntry them… that’s all we could do.\nWell we did we did it… it was midnight when we started and we were drifting\nas far away perhaps as this first house from her and course you couldn’t do\nmuch really because our motor boat went over and they put four depth\ncharges in her in the motorboat and that’s all she’d hold you see… carry.\nAnd so they took them over from off us it was our crew doing it and whatever\nthey’d done they went aboard the ship and they took the depth charges as\nthe captain said had got to be done and put them right down in the lower end\nof the ship because I mean she was a bloody massive thing and they did\neverything they could and fused everything that would explode and came\nback to us and bang she did, she went down blew the bottom out and she\nwent down but, off course we never see her no more because we left her\nthere but, she wasn’t too far off the coast and she was too far from Penang,\nthe ship wasn’t we were going up towards Penang.\n\n01:28:49\n\nWhat is said\nDid you see her going down then?\nOh yeah we watched without search light…\n\n01:28:53\n\nBet that was a special thing to see?\nWell we hung on until we more or less her mast was sticking out but, she’s\nstill going, she was still going down our men put depth charges all the way\nalong so when she got to a certain depth they’d open the bottom of the ship\nto let the water in as you do and they had to sit there until it filled up and fired\nthese charges and it was bloody you’d never see anything like it… it was\nfabulous but, of course you wasn’t allowed to have cameras.\n\n** Start of Film 5\n\n01:29:29\n\nJust talk a bit about how you would mine sweep the story about what\nyou do and how you do it?\nWell there is various ways you can do it. You can do it with wires out with\nfloats on well there’s different ways. You can put depth charges down, put\nthem down to certain depths and leave them down there weighted them down\nit depends what’s going to be there over them when you come back but,\nbasically you only do it to clear the ocean in the area you were in and if you\ngive ships colliding with them we get sent out there to sweep it.\n\n01:30:04\n\nDid you have any near missed with the mines?\nWell we’ve had them come up beside us yeah a time or two but, when you’re\nall joined together with great strong wires you’re in a formation like that and\neach side of it goes out to another ship and then they go out to another one\nand then out to the other then you’ve got seven but, you’re the one in the\nfront. You’re the one that’s got probably more equipment that you can sound\nthan the others so they do that sort of thing. They keep improving on certain\nthings and we may have been a little bit better I don’t know but, that’s how\nyou sweep you all over latch each other.\n\n01:30:53\n\nYou’ve actually got wires holding you together in a position?\n\n\n\nNo no it’s all done free they had to set one each side of you at a certain\ndistance then vice a versa for the next that’s how you do it. That’s when you\ndo that type of sweep but, there are other ways you can sweep and we used\nto do sweeps with long wires. We had a great big thing on our quarterdeck\nand it was full of heavy wire and we used to let that out with things on that\nand captain on the bridge he’d say let go and he’s stop it when he tells you,\nit’s a massive sack of wire on a drum and it’s not heavy wire but, you put\nanything on the end of it and you could let it out and it would explode mines\nif it finds them if there’s any there, you’ll know where you stand a little bit\nbetter. It’s all done on luck really because you can’t look down in the sea\nbut, we used to snag up on… we snagged up on an airplane down there that\nhad crashed… well we were told it were but, I never seen it but, I know when\nwe snagged it, it got around the ship that it was a plane but, I don’t know how\nthey knew because we didn’t stop but, you always got somebody that made\nsomething up didn’t you.\n\n01:32:29\n\nYou mentioned this about this Chatham and Pompey Rating when you\nsay he made life difficult what do you mean, how did he do that, what\nwas?\nWell I’ll tell you what happened we come home to England and I had the ???\nmost of the time because I used to go up and sit with him and then I’d take\nover because I was responsible for him you see so they didn’t have a long\nthing I’d just take it you see and help out. And one night when I was doing\nthat I had to be a quartermaster which means when we were at anchor I had\nto do a duty at the back of the ship where they come in and out of it when\nthey go ashore and one thing and another and all the logbooks there and\neverything and I was on duty there doing mine and we was almost coming\nhome at this point and I’d got a terrible throat and cold and it was pouring\nwith rain and I had to take the night watch and I thought well I got a cold and\nI took my oilskins out of my locker because they’d been there since we went\nabroad I mean you never had them out and I thought god I’m going to go\ndown and get my oilskins and of course I’m standing in an opening because\nyou can go in that side walk straight out and of the ship the other side. And\nat night time there is an officer and a crew come around the ships and they\ncheck if you’re being looked after and that.\n\n\n\n\n01:34:04\n\nAs I went down to get my… I nipped down because I got the duty watch to\nget my oil skin out and I got a terrible cold and this chap slung his hammock\nright across the top of the opening and walk down the step under to there\nand he’s winging about in his hammock and of course this is one o’clock in\nthe morning and unbeknown to me the boat come around and seen that I\nwasn’t there but, that didn’t catch nothing but, he told the captain that I had\nbeen down the locker and id been having a job to get the thing open because\nit was all stuck together being in the heat because we never wore them you\nsee there and the next thing he dropped me in it and he told the officer of the\nday that I was going down to sleep and I’m sitting trying to get this bloody\nthing open and of course I’ve got a lousy cold and he done that and the next\nthing he sent for the officer of the day and he come down and put me on a\ncharge, I had to meet the captain and everything and the captain didn’t like it\nat all… but, anyway he told me to forget everything he says you’re my man\nhe says never mind about him he said ‘we’ve had trouble with him before’ I\nbrought the ship home right the way up to the dockyard and the next day I\ncome home had three days leave and had to go back down to Chatham again\nbecause they were demobbing they were all finished you see by then.\n\n01:35:58\n\nThey never give me a demob suit or nothing so I went to this to see what was\nhappening and they said ‘oh you’re going up to Scotland there’s a ship up\nthere you’re going on’ so I said ‘oh yeah how am I going to get there’ he said\n‘it’s alright there’s two other chaps coming up with you you’ll all be going\ntogether and that was that big ship up there of course she was only on loan\nduring the war you see to us lot because Canadian you see got to go home.\nI was billeted on her for… they put us on there to sleep and everything quite\na few of us and we slept onboard and everything but, by the time they wanted\nto take her home to Canada they sent for me and I went to the office and I\nhad a bit of a problem and I had to see the doctor and the bloody doctor said\nI wasn’t fit to go so they paid me off the day before it sailed. And I had to\ncome out the navy I’d got something in the chest and I had to see the doctor\nand he said you’re not fit enough he said anymore for the navy, cheeky\nbugger\n\n01:37:29\n\nEnd of Films\n\n\n", "label": [[2251, 2255, "ORGANISATION"], [2334, 2338, "ORGANISATION"], [2357, 2361, "ORGANISATION"], [2402, 2412, "ORGANISATION"], [2455, 2460, "EQUIPMENT"], [2466, 2477, "EQUIPMENT"], [2794, 2798, "ORGANISATION"], [3105, 3115, "ORGANISATION"], [3190, 3200, "ORGANISATION"], [3246, 3256, "EQUIPMENT"], [3169, 3173, "EQUIPMENT"], [3372, 3378, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [2883, 2889, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [3818, 3826, "LOCATION"], [3959, 3967, "LOCATION"], [4042, 4049, "LOCATION"], [4116, 4126, "ORGANISATION"], [4143, 4148, "EQUIPMENT"], [4190, 4201, "EQUIPMENT"], [4206, 4220, "LOCATION"], [4376, 4383, "EQUIPMENT"], [4629, 4636, "LOCATION"], [4661, 4668, "LOCATION"], [4791, 4797, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [4923, 4931, "LOCATION"], [5028, 5038, "LOCATION"], [5146, 5162, "LOCATION"], [5321, 5327, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [5505, 5514, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [5536, 5545, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [5587, 5594, "NATIONALITY"], [5603, 5612, "NATIONALITY"], [5649, 5656, "LOCATION"], [5712, 5719, "NATIONALITY"], [5734, 5740, "NATIONALITY"], [5873, 5882, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [6287, 6293, "NATIONALITY"], [6354, 6363, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [6638, 6644, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [6863, 6870, "EQUIPMENT"], [7085, 7091, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [5963, 5972, "NATIONALITY"], [6456, 6473, "LOCATION"], [7488, 7494, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [7683, 7689, "LOCATION"], [7724, 7738, "LOCATION"], [7937, 7943, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [7973, 7979, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [8436, 8451, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [8794, 8801, "LOCATION"], [9228, 9237, "LOCATION"], [10127, 10133, "LOCATION"], [10169, 10176, "LOCATION"], [10397, 10407, "EQUIPMENT"], [10490, 10500, "EQUIPMENT"], [11098, 11104, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [11321, 11330, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [11347, 11352, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [11482, 11489, "NATIONALITY"], [11500, 11506, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [11660, 11667, "NATIONALITY"], [12053, 12059, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [12282, 12289, "LOCATION"], [12806, 12819, "EQUIPMENT"], [12901, 12908, "EQUIPMENT"], [13039, 13045, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [13220, 13226, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [13789, 13796, "EQUIPMENT"], [14000, 14012, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [14032, 14039, "EQUIPMENT"], [12206, 12219, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [11878, 11891, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [14224, 14232, "NATIONALITY"], [14688, 14696, "NATIONALITY"], [14727, 14740, "DATE"], [14996, 15002, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [15568, 15574, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [15618, 15624, "VEHICLE_SHIP_NAME"], [15635, 15641, "NATIONALITY"], [15635, 15651, "EVENT"], [15677, 15684, "LOCATION"], [15689, 15705, "LOCATION"], [15868, 15884, "LOCATION"], [16146, 16157, "LOCATION"], [16257, 16265, "LOCATION"], [16405, 16413, "NATIONALITY"], [16583, 16589, "LOCATION"], [16754, 16759, "LOCATION"], [16887, 16892, "LOCATION"], [16959, 16965, "LOCATION"], [17427, 17433, "LOCATION"], [17380, 17385, "LOCATION"], [17534, 17542, "LOCATION"], [17753, 17761, "LOCATION"], [17919, 17923, "ORGANISATION"], [17938, 17942, "ORGANISATION"], [18086, 18093, "LOCATION"], [18320, 18327, "LOCATION"], [18781, 18800, "RANK"], [18889, 18896, "RANK"], [19371, 19379, "NATIONALITY"], [19467, 19475, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [19744, 19752, "NATIONALITY"], [19801, 19818, "LOCATION"], [20019, 20028, "LOCATION"], [20031, 20034, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [20049, 20053, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [20181, 20196, "LOCATION"], [20440, 20448, "NATIONALITY"], [20449, 20453, "VEHICLE_SHIP_CLASS"], [20983, 20990, "RANK"], [21427, 21434, "RANK"], [21523, 21536, "EQUIPMENT"], [21556, 21569, "EQUIPMENT"], [21597, 21610, "EQUIPMENT"], [21770, 21783, "EQUIPMENT"], [22037, 22050, "EQUIPMENT"], [22250, 22263, "EQUIPMENT"], [22271, 22278, "RANK"], [22697, 22703, "LOCATION"], [22746, 22752, "LOCATION"], [23025, 23038, "EQUIPMENT"], [23597, 23610, "EQUIPMENT"], [23958, 23963, "EQUIPMENT"], [25002, 25009, "RANK"], [25223, 25228, "EQUIPMENT"], [25753, 25760, "LOCATION"], [25765, 25771, "LOCATION"], [26183, 26196, "RANK"], [27476, 27483, "RANK"], [27980, 27987, "RANK"], [28011, 28018, "RANK"], [28315, 28322, "LOCATION"], [28532, 28540, "LOCATION"], [28832, 28840, "NATIONALITY"], [29040, 29046, "LOCATION"], [29264, 29268, "ORGANISATION"], [29386, 29390, "ORGANISATION"], [2955, 2966, "LOCATION"]]}

At the end of\nthe medical those who were accepted were told so and the others were\nsent home and we were kept behind told us that we would be sent for on a\ncertain day which was actually the 10th Feb 1936. Went into barracks there\nyou had eight weeks what they call field training which is all parade work,\nrifles and everything like that you get used to, then after the eight weeks\nyou then go to your engineering place which was the stokers department\nand did your eight weeks mechanical training and after that eight weeks\nyou became eligible for being sent around the ships but I had to wait until\nSeptember before I got sent to H.M.S Hood.\n\n01:02:12\n\nSo what was it like for you as an eighteen years old to walk up the\ngangplank on something like H.M.S Hood?\n\n01:02:20\n\nI had been on the Hood two years previously on a visitors day when she\nwas open to the public I had been aboard her but it was strange knowing I\nwas going aboard there to live for a certain amount of time and that’s the\nonly difference and I stayed on there for three years and two months left\nher just after the war in November as the war started\n\n01:02:50\n\nWhat were your memories of the Hood?\n\n\n\n01:02:52\n\nWell they were great because… we didn’t do much visiting because at that\ntime there was the Spanish wars on, civil war and we were doing what they\ncall none intervention patrols. The Spanish royalists and the rebels with\ntheir ships were interfering with merchant ships so we were doing patrols to\nmake certain that they didn’t have a go at us. We did have a bit of an\nargument at one time we had to go to… we were sent on emergency from\nGibraltar to go up to Bilbao, at Bilbao there was a chap… merchant navy\nchap there Potato Jones was trying to run into Bilbao with his cargo and\nthere was a Spanish battleship there trying to stop him so there was the\nHood and us up and down either way and in the end Potato Jones got to\nwhere he wanted to.\n\n01:04:07\n\nWho was Potato Jones?\n\n01:04:09\n\nHe was a merchant captain on a merchant ship and he was running a\npotato that’s why they called him Potato Jones.\n\n01:04:18\n\nWhat was your day to day roll on the Hood at the time?\n\n01:04:21\n\nWhen I went aboard the Hood she was just commissioning, she just been\nin for a small refit and she was commissioning so she took a load of people\naboard I would say probably about twelve hundred people aboard it at one\ntime and there was so many second class stokers, which is was one of\nthem and normally when you’re a second class stoker you go aboard and\nyou do all the boiler room work, the double bottom tanks that’s the oil tanks\nand everything they need cleaning and you did all those jobs first but there\nwas so many of us second class stokers that I went in the engine room and\nfrom then I was there for a little while then I got working with the Chief ERA\nof the engine room and then when he got sent home because he was\ncoming up to his twenty two years I got my auxiliary watch keeping\ncertificate.\n\n01:05:28\n\nThat’s a certificate you have to get by being able to look after all the\nauxiliary machinery like the dynamos and your evaporators there were…\nwe had reciprocating dynamos, we had turbo dynamos, we had diesel\ndynamos you had to learn all about these and at the end of that time which\nwould take roughly about six months you got your auxiliary watch keeping\ncertificate your name was then sent to Portsmouth barracks and that\nentered you into the mechanical training establishment which put you\nthrough for advancement. Well after a while I managed to get onto the\nCaptains motorboat as a stoker on his motorboat which was a very good\njob and I stayed there until I left the Hood in November very good job\n\n01:06:30\n\nJust going back a little bit obviously when you joined the Hood she\nwas you know out and about and showing muscle if you like, showing\nBritish muscle…\n\n\n\n\n01:06:47\n\nYeah when we went aboard we… I would say approximately three or four\nweeks we were getting prepared for going out. We went out to\nMediterranean for three years.\n\n** Start of Film 2\n\n01:06:58\n\nWhat do you recall of the outbreak of war and how did the\natmosphere on the ship change?\n\n01:07:04\n\nWell there something I could never understand nobody seemed to worry\nabout it. I’ll give you an instance in 1938 the Munich Crisis when\nChamberlin came back waving this piece of paper now in the\nMediterranean we had American ships, German ships, Italian ships all on\ndoing this none intervention now the I don’t know whether it was the\nBismarck or the Graf Spee all of a sudden she disappeared from the\nMediterranean well then they sent the Hood out to see because the crisis\nwas there and anything could have happened and for several days we\nwere more or less shadowing her so if the war had started we would have\nbeen right in top of her because in those days you could do that you didn’t\nhave radar or anything but you could do it by radio signals.\n\n01:08:12\n\nWell then the crisis was called off we go back into Gibraltar and a little later\nI don’t know if it was Deutschland or the Graf Spee one of them pocket\nbattleships came back into Gibraltar and we were unfortunate that when\nwe tying up on the mooring in Gibraltar a wire parted and killed two of our\ncrew one marine and one seaman. And then we held a football match and\nthe proceeds from the football match went to the dependants and that\nmatch was between the German ship and the Hood and a few days earlier\nwe would have been trying to blow each other out of the water and yet\nthree days later we were playing a game of football and actually we beat\nthem three nil.\nDid you play?\n\n01:09:10\n\nNo..\nSo that was just after the outbreak of war?\n\n01:09:14\n\nThat was 1938 crisis… ok… which was a very memorial time with that…\nwith Chamberlin with his piece of paper… piece in our time which didn’t\nwork out. Well from then on we carried on with our time in the\nMediterranean we came home in January 39 and they had to do some\nrepair work on her and I would say probably about September we set sail\nfrom Pompey just before the war started.\n\n01:09:57\n\nDid you have an inkling was there a sense that war was about too\nbreak?\n\n\n\n\n01:10:00\n\nWell yeah because you know you had this propaganda going around you\nknow from the press and that and everybody was getting trained up…\nabout three days before the Hood… before the war started the Hood went\nto sea to do a full… what they call a full calibre gun shoot training so when\nthey did that we used to leave motorboats in because they should have\nbeen back the same night but she didn’t come back for three days and we\nwas stranded in Scapa Flow but we managed to get some food from the\nsalvage people who were salvaging the ships from world war one and then\nwe went aboard the Iron Duke for a couple of days until the Hood come\nback in and then we went out to whatever we did do you know.\n\n01:11:03\n\nJust before I left we unfortunately got bombed they split a few plates on the\nship side but nothing disastrous\nWas that aerial bombardment?\n\n01:11:17\n\nYeah…\nWhere were you, were you below decks at that point?\n\n01:11:22\n\nOh yeah I would be below decks most time, most of my time in the Navy\nwhenever you were In action was mostly below deck the only time I wasn’t\nbelow deck was when I was on the motor launches and I had a dual\npurpose job then but that should come later, but then we came back into\nScapa and they said to me you go to go into barracks and do your\nmechanical training course and I left her then… I don’t think I saw her ever\nagain until… well I didn’t see her but I heard about her being sunk\n\n01:12:10\n\nHow did you feel when you heard that having spent three good years\non her?\n\n01:12:13\n\nWell it’s something that’s very awkward to describe really because you\nhave this feeling you now of such a lovely ship like that and so many crew\nthat you know… but I had mates that were left on there that went down\nwith her so you know you had this feeling about it because that was the\nfirst time really that death had come to us in that way\n\n01:12:48\n\nI mean it’s an amazing stroke of fortune isn’t it that you were sent off\njust before she set sail for that?\n\n01:12:54\n\nWell no I left her in November 40 and she didn’t get sunk until May 41 I’d\nleft my second ship then H.M.S Cossack I joined her in April 14 and left her\nin April 41because I got rated up and there was one to many of the rates\nso they sent me off.\n\n01:13:20\n\nBut what happened after you done the mechanical coarse and I mean\nwhat were you learning on that, why was that a good move for you?\n\n\n\n\n01:13:27\n\nIt was a good move because it was your ladder to promotion as PO your\nname got in there and then you did your training so I went to sea in the\nCossack as a stoker I hadn’t been there very long and I got made up\nleading stoker I left her as leading stoker and went to my next boat and I\nwas on there and I was made a PO so a mechanical course was a great\nasset to me\n\n** Start of Film 3\n\n01:14:00\n\nWhat was it like going to Cossack and how did that compare and\nwhat were your thoughts about the Cossack?\n\n01:14:06\n\nWell the Cossack… I picked the Cossack up she’d come back from The\nSecond Battle Of Narvik and she’d been hit about four times by German\nshells and she was in a bad way, she had quite a few killed on there and\nfortunately for me she went into dock in Southampton for repairs and I lived\nin Eastleigh which is very good for me but that was a good point about it\nbut there is a difference because you come down from a thousand four\nhundred crew to about a hundred and eighty the whole amount of them will\nbe about a hundred and eighty so it was a different atmosphere all over\nbecause your more integrated because there were chaps on the hood that\nI never even knew the Nobby Clark was a stoker with me on the Hood, I\ndidn’t even know him he was there at the same time as me, I never knew\nhim I never met him until I joined the Hood association but destroyers to\nme were the main thing in those days, to be on a destroyer, it was great.\n\n01:15:26\n\nWhy did you have that sense of satisfaction?\n\n01:15:29\n\nI think the thing is you mingled with lots of people, when you’re on the\nHood the most people you mingled with were stokers but on the Cossack\nwas:- you had stokers you had seaman, you had telegraphists and god\nknows what and you more or less met them individually whereas on the\nHood you wouldn’t meet them at all\n\n01:15:58\n\nWhere did you go with the Cossack?\n\n01:15:59\n\nWell we were on Atlantic convoys, we did do three of the Tribal boats from\nRosyth which our captain was the senior man, we attacked a German\nconvoy over at Ebro light in Norway an action that took about twenty odd\nminutes and the convoy and its two escorts were gone lost three boats\nvery superior boats they were.\n\n01:16:38\n\nWhat do you remember of that action?\n\n\n\n\n01:16:39\n\nNothing much… most of my time when there was action on destroyers and\nthe Hood I was always down below. On the Cossack you worked in three\nwatches so if you were on watch you were in the engine room, if action\nstations were done you’d try and change over you’d come out the engine\nroom and you went down the forehead boiler room to man the\ncompressors and longest of watch you went to the steering gear in the tiller\nflat where you had dual system if anything went wrong you changed over\nfrom one system to another and I had just been relieved by leading stoker\nWoods and he’d gone to the phone ( pair of earphones like you) picked\nthem up like that… contacted the bridge leading stoker Woods just relieved\nleading stoker Kellaway and a bit of shrapnel came through the ships side\nand he was a very big hefty chap and it split is arm right down to the bone\nthere as it came through the side, so that could have been me but it wasn’t\nit was stoker Woods.\n\n01:18:10\n\nDid he survive?\n\n01:18:11\n\nOh yes he survived yes…\n\n01:18:13\n\nIs there any sense that you were in a battle even below decks… as far\nbelow deck as you were?\n\n01:18:19\n\nThe only thing I remember while on the destroyers and that. When I was on\nthe launchers and that it was a different matter. When I was in the tiller flat\nthe after twin 47 was above me and you could hear them firing and doing\nwhat they had to do, which you know you were down there on your own\nyou locked in… more or less locked in because they watertight\ncompartments so your doors locked not locked it’s clipped but that was a\nfeeling you know you heard the guns going off that a… you know what’s\nhappening.\n\n01:19:03\n\nI noticed from your notes that one of the sort of big, almost continual\nissues that you had to deal with were the mountainous seas… oh\ndefiantly were there any that you recall any particular events?\n\n\n\n\n01:19:20\n\nOne special one, which was Christmas Day, which would have been 1940\nwe had been ordered out from Scapa on some mission or other and when\nwe got outside it was a blinder the seas were mountainous and somebody\nsent down to the mess stores are ready so you had a galvanised tin about\nthat size, about that wide, about that deep which you went up and got your\ntea, sugar and tins of milk. Well I went up and got these because we had\nall new stokers called up for the war and you know some of them were real\nseasick. Well I came down and as I got down the ladder me first foot on\nthe ladder she was bouncing a lot at the time and I said to the lads below, I\nsaid steady me which normally the other chaps that knew the job would\nhave got hold of my backside ease me down and all of a sudden the ship\nwent up and down I was thrown up and this metal container comes down\nthe side of my nose and split it down there had to go into sick bay and have\nit stitched up. That was a moment… momentous moment.\n\n01:20:52\n\nDid you ever get seasick or did you have good sea legs?\n\n01:20:56\n\nI had very good seasick but the very funny thing is about it is when I was\nwaiting for my commission first commission on the Hood you fell in outside\nthe regulating office and the ???? came out there and chopped you off you\nthere, you there , you there somewhere else and he came to us two chaps\nand he said go and get your overalls and go round to the lorry park and\nthey’ll take you down the docks you’ve got to take a destroyer to sea for\nthe day. So we get down the docks I think the boat was the Ambuscade\nshe was doing torpedo runs for the torpedo school so I go aboard there\nand I got straight thee and had to go down the boiler room and I was down\nthere until twelve o’clock and I came up and by that… just after that about\ntwo o’clock the destroyer came back into harbour and we went back into\nPompey ok so get in the mess were in about six o’clock mealed up so I\nhelped we all mucked in and served it out and that I’m sat down at the\ntable and this is honest, sat down at a table like that there’s a long table\nholds about eight or nine each side and I was sat down there and that table\ncome up to me like that… that’s the only time I had any feeling about the\nsea… seasick in the barracks you wouldn’t believe it would you. Yeah just\nsat down there and that (demonstrates table up and down) but in my mind\nit did.\n\n** Start of Film 4\n\n01:22:43\n\nI had just been rated up to leading stoker and they had one too many so\nthey sent me back to barracks and when I got back to barracks I was\ndrafted too motor launches these were very versatile boats they could be\nused for torpedo boats, submarine chasers, used for secret service\ndropping spies everywhere, they weighed about sixty four ton, they had a\ncrew of about two officers and about ten men and I got drafted to them.\nWell when the Hood was sunk I was in Esher doing a high speed engine\ncourse for these boats at a place called there Railton Cars and if you go\nback in history Railtons were racing cars.\n\n\nDid you say Esher?\n\n01:23:44\n\nEsher\nIn Surrey?\n\n01:23:49\n\nYeah they had this big place where they designed engines for cars and\nthat Railton Cars and that’s when I heard about the Hood. Well I left there\nwent back to barracks and the next thing is I’m on my way up to Fort\nWilliam and we had to do a fortnights course on these motor launches\nwhere we were more or less given instruction on everybody’s job so if any\nof the crew got injured up top someone else could step in like a seaman\ncould nip down below, I couldn’t nip up and do some of their job and from\nthere we went down to Brixham, yeah about ten of us and from Brixham we\nwent up to Appledore North Devon and we picked up a ML 279 and when\nwe saw her on the slips there, she’d just been finished off she had a\ncopper bottom we told us we were going abroad somewhere.\n\n01:25:01\n\nSo we took her up West Africa and we were running up and down the\ncoast there Bathurst, Freetown, Takoradi one trip we did to Liberia which\nwas the original place where the Negros went when they were liberated we\nstayed there for about ten days well I had two boats there because I got\nmade a PO and I went then in charge of the engine department on 209\n\n01:25:45\n\nWhat was it like to have gone from you know something as big as the\nHood to the Cossack to a such a small crew I mean you know how did\nyou adapt and how were you put with the crew?\n\n01:25:56\n\nThe thing is that you when you were in barracks or a large ship everything\nwas done for you in the line of cooking and catering and that as soon as\nyou went aboard a destroyer you prepared the food and the cook cooked it\nfor you, quite a difference and then when you went aboard these small\nboats you had to rely on one of your mates to be able to cook if not you\nwere in a bad way for meals.\n\n01:26:33\n\nWe did a when we left the shipyard from Plymouth we went up to\nLondonderry and from Londonderry it took us nearly seven days to get to\nGibraltar there was four of us boats and two flower class boats they were\nbigger than us and they were are escorts to Gibraltar\n\n01:27:05\n\nWhat was it like crossing the Bay of Biscay in something that big?\n\n\n\n\n01:27:09\n\nWe could only use one engine, we didn’t carry enough fuel to go all the\nway normally a day trip to… from England to Gibraltar three days but\nbecause you had to do a detour to evade the German forces it took near\nenough seven days. Well we had one thousand four hundred and fifty\ngallon of petrol tanks in our main tanks and they put five tanks on deck with\nfive hundred gallons in each and as you went through the normal tank you\ndrained the others into the main tanks so you had these five just ordinary\nsteel tanks on deck with five hundred gallons of fuel in them\n\n01:28:11\n\nDid you… I take it that you didn’t encounter any Germans or anything\nbecause I mean that sort of boat your pretty much a sitting duck\naren’t you?\n\n01:28:19\n\nOh you are… the only thing you got in your favour that your very small in\nthe water which is quite a good thing you know.\n\n** Start of Film 5\n\n01:28:30\n\nA young man from Eastleigh you’ve travelled a little bit but you’ve\nnever been to Africa what was it like going to North Africa for the first\ntime… what do you recall of Africa?\n\n01:28:40\n\nI went to North Africa actually when I was on the Hood my first trip abroad\nfrom the Hood was in Tangiers and then we went round to Oran and\nvarious places so we got… but when we went to Bathurst and Freetown it\nwas so primitive there you know they had little tin huts anything was\nchucked up somewhere they could live you know.\n\n01:29:12\n\nOk and then so when you were down there you went to 279 just talk\nthrough a bit about that please?\n\n01:29:17\n\nWell I had been rated PO and our skipper came aboard one day and he\nsaid I got a job for you if you’ll take it will you take over engine staff at 279\nthere mechanic wants to go ashore I said that’s ok with me you know gave\nme an extra shilling a day which was quite a lot of money then I was only\non about seven shillings a week, seven shillings a day at that time so that\ngave me another shilling another… no one and sixpence, one and\nsixpence charge money. When I went aboard 279 we did several trips up\nand down the coast there. What we normally did we just took one ship that\none ship kept in close to the coast and we kept on the outside of it and we\ndid submarine sweeps all the time you know.\n\n\n\n\n01:30:22\n\nWell then I got called back to barracks, but before I got into Pompey\nbarracks they sent us to Portland to the small ships base and the engineer\nsaid he said you are not going to barracks I need you for boats here and he\nkept us there and I got drafted to ML 100 which was one of the first MLs\nbuilt the only difference was she was more or less a flat bottom boat and\nshe had three engines where the other boats only had two and she was a\nminelayer so we used to carry these mines, six mines we used to carry like\na torpedo shape mine we just dropped them over the side get to a specific\npoint and lay them and we used to drop them, well I managed all there time\nI did about ten trips with them. Well sometimes we used to go up ????\nRiver that’s when we carried the pimple mines we carried eight of those so\nwe’d go up the river and on the way out we’d lay our mines so we weren’t\nbeing worried about anybody chasing us because they’d run into our\nmines.\n\n01:31:52\n\nDo you ever remember even in Africa as well any particular incident\nwhere there was any kind of contact or memorable moments?\n\n01:32:01\n\nNo there was nothing… nothing special at all there our biggest problem\nwas that we had engine troubles break down of engine, which was a hell of\na job. We had one problem there when we used to go along side these big\ntankers for fuel well when the tanker was empty it used to fill up with water,\nits tanks up with water then go down to South Africa way pump all the\nwater out and fill up with fuel, would be oil fuel, petrol and various things\nwell then we found we were getting this… we were steaming along one day\nand all of a sudden the engine cut out and what was happening we still had\nwater in our petrol, which was quite a big job because once your engine\nstopped you changed over to your auxiliary filter started the other engine\nup but then you had to get the other engine prepared and if you can think\nof standing on top of an aircraft type of engine because you got six\ncylinders either side and you’ve got a manifold that runs through the middle\nof it about that long with three carburettors underneath it and you got to\nstand on top of this engine and take this off hell of a job it was, but it was a\ngood job very interesting.\n\nAnd this is out at sea is it?\n01:33:35\n\nYeah…\nSo the boats tossing about in the surf?\n\n\n\n\n01:33:39\n\nYeah… when you’re going down the African Coast the sea is coming in\nthat way all the time so your boat is more or less doing that… it’s not doing\nthat… it’s doing that (indicates the way the ship is moving) so you just\nfancy standing on top of this engine one foot on either set of pistons or the\ncovers of the pistons and taking this manifold off because you got to get\nthe carburettors out to drain the water out but another problem we had was\nthat the engine room… the engine oil that we was getting out there was\nvery weak and if you didn’t watch out, the system was at the top of the cam\nshaft each end you had two little oil pumps… petrol pumps and they were a\nvein type of motor which if you remember the Wankel engine as it goes\naround so these two pieces come in and out causes suction and discharge\nthey were fitted on the end of cam shafts now they ran at ten pound per\nsquare inch and the oil pressure ran at forty pound per square inch but with\nthe oil being a poor quality that it had no body and the petrol would leak\nfrom the pump along the cam shaft and go down in the sump of the engine\nand if you didn’t watch it but to long you had say you got that much of oil\nthere… you had about that much on with water and that\n\n01:35:21\n\nand ML 301 she actually blew up and they put that down to the fact she got\nwater in and the engine more or less stalled and started and blew up and\nthey lost the boat… the boat was lost because there only made of wood\nyou only had to have a slightest fire there… they were dangerous but on\nML100 I had a good job there because I had a leading stoker and two\nstokers well they used to man the engine room and I had to do whatever\nthe skipper wanted if I wanted down the engine room I went down there\nand had a look at those things but I would lay a smoke screen we had a\nchemical… I forget the name of it but on the stern of the ML we had this\nlike a little drum about that size about that round and you had an air vessel\nup by the bridge so you went down and opened up the valve on the\ncylinder then opened up the air pressure blew this chemical out and as\nsoon as it hit the water you got a big smoke screen and we were always\nlaying a smoke screen because of the German E-Boats we were in roughly\na thousand yards of E-Boats, we could picked them up at a thousand yards\nwith our radar but if they got inside that thousand yards we didn’t know\nwhere they were you had to rely on visibility people being able to look at\nthem and pick them out.\n\n01:37:06\n\nClimate wise and that whole lifestyle of being on one of something\nlike 109s and what have you to then go and see the Skate I mean that\nmust have been a bit of a come down?\n\n\n\n\n01:37:20\n\nWell with the MLs and that it was very good because you only had twelve\ncrew two officers so you mixed well you learnt about each other’s job. I\nhad a stoker Jimmy James who came from Salisbury he was a better\ntelegraphist than the telegraphist was the telegraphist on small boats he\nused to be more or less look after the two officers, the officers fed off the\nsame food as us it was his job to make certain they got their food, keep\ntheir cabin clear. Everybody worked together I used to work with the\nskipper and he used to get me on the bridge and have me take noon day\nsights so if anything went wrong I could always navigate the boat\n\n01:38:21\n\nWere you disappointed to leave the MLs?\n\n01:38:24\n\nYes I was really because they were great you know because you were so\nfriendly it was just like you and I talking together there’s twelve of you there\nwhich was ML100 there was only four in engine department but then you\nhad your gunners you had your ASDIC rating you had a telegraphist you\nknow very friendly and the officers were… they were not naval trained they\nwere civilians who had university degrees probably amateur yachtsmen\nthey were all well to do people my skipper Booth on my first boat Dennis\nBooth he was the son of Booth Brothers Shipping Line he was a good\nskipper very nice, very nice it was a totally different life altogether\n\n01:39:32\n\nSo then I came off there and went to the Skate well your back then to naval\nroutine well I managed to stay on her until she had to be scraped then I\npicked up H.M.S Loch Tarbert\n\n01:39:47\n\nWhat year was that?\n\n01:39:50\n\nI can’t quite remember the date of that but it was before VE Day that was\nwhat forty five wasn’t it so I would say late 44\n\n** Start of Film 6\n\n01:40:14\n\nWhere did you go after the…?\n\n01:40:16\n\nWell after that I got… the Navy said these Po’s are gonna come back\n\n01:40:22\n\nWhat year is this by the way?\n\n01:40:24\n\nI left the ML’s September 43 I got back into barracks I had about a week’s\nleave I went back of leave and I was sent up to Hull to pick up H.M.S Skate\nshe was 1916 she weighed about nine hundred tons she was one of the\nsmallest destroyers we had she was built for North Sea work but they had\nconverted her into an escort vessel they’d taken her torpedo tubes out and\na couple of guns then fitted her up with depth charges so we could do\nescort duties.\n\n\n\n\n01:41:17\n\nWell the first job we did was we went round to Loch Ewe and we did two\nArctic convoys from there and then we were doing running between\nLondonderry and Iceland taking military stuff up like… you had this I think it\nwas Empress of Canada she took all the Canadians up there and of course\nwe had Canadian troops in Iceland during the war in case there was any\ninvasion well we were… we came back into Londonderry and we were told\nwe had to go down to Plymouth well on the way down we passed\nthrough… we were in London we were going over by Scotland and as we\ngot near one of the Lochs we were told we had to go in there and do an\nexercise with submarines, they were training new captains for submarines\nso they had three of us boats and we were running down the loch quite a\nspeed and we were the last one and this submarine had to come up astern\nof us and use its sounding gear to find out where we was and it had to\ncome up astern of us instead of that it came up right up under our props so\nwe then had to, we damaged her conning tower and everything\n\n01:43:04\n\nso two boats were more or less out of action so they then sent us round to\nBarrow for docking it was a lame duck escorting a lame duck the\nsubmarine went into one dock and we went in the other and we had to\nhave two new shafts, two new props\n\n01:43:30\n\nDid your captain get into trouble for that?\n\n01:43:31\n\nNo… well I don’t know that, it wouldn’t be him it would be the training\ncommander on the submarine\n\n01:43:40\n\nI just want to go back a little bit actually Alec… what was it like having\nyou know spent a year or so whatever that was down in North Africa\nhaving not been in England for a while to come back and find Britain\nin 43 when you were on leave do you recollect that… what was it…\nwas it a different place?\n\n01:44:01\n\nIt was defiantly a different place because my wife and I we managed to get\nup to London for a couple of days I had seen the bombing in Pompey and\nthat and Plymouth but when I got to London it was devastating to see the\namount of damage that had been done by the bombs and that.\n\n01:44:25\n\nDid you see any Battle of Britain while you were in London at that\npoint?\n\n\n\n\n01:44:28\n\nNo… I was on leave from the Cossack that’s it we got to go back again\nnow. I was on leave from the Cossack and I was going back on a Sunday\nevening when the first planes bombed London and we got as far as\nClapham Junction as trains were stopped we were taken off, put on buses\nand taken round to King’s Cross where we needed to because the\nCossack was in dry dock in Edinburgh so we had to go to King’s Cross we\nwere then put in air raid shelters and that because there was bombing\ngoing on but we just mingled in with the crowd you know and they didn’t\nseem to worry about it… they must of worried about it but they didn’t show\nit you know there was no panic or anything like that\n\n01:45:25\n\nAnother thing I was just curious to hear you were married at this\npoint you know how was it being away from your wife for such long\nperiods of time?\n\n01:45:33\n\nWell I was… really when you look at it I was very fortunate when it came to\nleave I finished my mechanical training then I got married well the first boat\nI picked up was the Cossack and she was in dock for a couple of months\nbecause she’d been so heavily hit by the German shells so I had a couple\nof months there and then we went to sea and you went to sea in any\nweather you know if the weather was bad in normal times they say well we\nwon’t do this exercise we don’t want to damage the ship but you had to go\nto sea so a destroyer used to take a lot of hammering and that meant she\nhad to keep going in dry dock so when she got in dry dock you might be in\nthere for a fortnight so you got leave for each watch, week for each watch\nand this went on all the time even when I was on the Skate we had this\nbecause if you read my story of the Skate it’s a wonder she stay afloat\n\n** Start of Film 7\n\n01:46:42\n\nWhat ship were you on and what were your recollections of D-Day?\n\n01:46:45\n\nI was on the Skate at D-Day and as I say we went out the day before we\nthen had to abandon that exercise we went back to Plymouth we fuelled up\nand everything and we didn’t go to sea on D-Day but we went too sea the\nnext day. When we got over the coast there Normandy Coast there was a\nCanadian plane that got shot down and were trying to pick the crew up and\nas soon as we got near them there rowing away in their dingy until we\ncould make them understand we were British very funny thing that was…\nyeah…\n\n01:47:37\n\nWhat was your recollection were you on deck at all on D-Day did you\nget to see anything?\n\n01:47:41\n\nNo… most of my time was always down below… … you see you would be\nat action stations until you left the area so I would either be down the a…\nwell my action station was forehead damage control or on watch in the\nboiler room\n\n\n\n01:48:05\n\nWhat happened to the Skate just after D-Day you split the side or\nsomething?\n\n01:48:08\n\nYes we went out to the Atlantic to relieve these Americans that had brought\nthis convoy over and we brought them in and I’m on watch down the aft\nboiler room and I’m just doing a walk around to see everything’s alright and\nI got behind the fans that were supplying air to the boilers and I got cold\nwater on my neck and I thought cold water in a boiler room impossible and\nwhen I looked up there was a very thin spray of water coming through the\nships side like that you couldn’t see the gash but there was a thin spray of\nwater coming through so I rang up the engine room and told the engineer\nin charge there they sent somebody over to have a look we then went into\nPlymouth and no not to Plymouth sorry… into Falmouth they put a\nconcrete patch over that, they built a frame filled it up with concrete that\nstopped the leak\n\n01:49:15\n\nWe then went round to Devonport and as we were going in through the\nboom they signalled us to say your degaussing gear is not working it was a\ngood job there were no magnetic mines about. What had happened water\nhad come over that and got into this motor and it wasn’t working properly\nso we then went alongside a cruiser there The Black Prince and we tied up\nalongside her and as we tied up one of our steam pipes burst and of\ncourse were chucking out black smoke then everywhere and this skipper\ncomes along you ought to of heard what he said about this because we\nwere making the Black Prince black\n\n01:50:06\n\nWas the split a consequence of activity on D-Day?\n\n01:50:11\n\nIt’s what they said it was crystallisation of the steel so they then towed us\nup to… into the dock itself and by the time we got there we had raised\nsteam again and we went along side this tug, there was a tug there and\nshe just had a refit and she had brand new paint and everything and my\nsteam injector that had never worked before worked and it pulled all this oil\nout, dirty oil water out of the bilges and straight over the ship never seen\nanything like it. So then they moved us round somewhere else in the end\nthey said to us sorry everybody’s got to leave the ship she’s going to be\nscraped and that’s when I picked up the Loch Tarbert then\n\n01:51:09\n\nWere you sad to leave the Skate?\n\n01:51:11\n\nYes she was a nice boat I had some good mates on there that’s the main\nthing… very good mates\n\n01:51:18\n\nWith the Skate after you had the incident with the sub on a couple of\nthe Arctic convoys wasn’t there fires that nearly sank the ship and\nstuff… wasn’t there incidents of fire and other incidents?\n\n\n\n\n01:51:31\n\nOh yeah… we had fires on the Skate… which we had… if there was a\nthing that went wrong it went wrong on the Skate she was so old she\nshould have been scraped when they took the guns out and the torpedo\ntubes they had to put ballast in the ship so in the boiler rooms underneath\nthe boilers they put in these big cast iron ingots about that long about that\nshape about that long but they never cleaned the bilges out so as soon as\nwe got to sea the oil that was in the bilges floated on any water that was\nthere and there was about that much difference between the bottom of a\nboiler now you’re looking at a boiler that’s the size of this room and\nunderneath that which is quite an area you got these ingots there and this\noil that’s floating across and the heat from the boilers set them alight we\nhad fires there which we had to see to, we had problems with the fresh\nwater where she was so weak that the oil was running into the fresh water\ntanks and the water was running into the oil tanks it got to a state there\nonce that our two senior PO’s asked permission to see the captain and\nthey brought it up about the state of the ship and they put us in dock in\nLondonderry for a couple of days or so and tried to do something about it…\ntanks but it didn’t work we still had that problem water in the oil and oil in\nthe water always had this problem.\n\n01:53:39\n\nAs soon as we were free we used to come in from having a convoy into\nfrom the Atlantic the American ones we used to pick them up and bring\nthem into Portsmouth area and we go in fuel up store up and we’d be back\nout again straight away you know.\n\n01:54:00\n\nThat’s a point actually we haven’t touched upon that… what do you\nrecollect about the convoys… and the Arctic convoy was to Iceland\nyeah and obviously the Atlantic was to Canada or America but you\nnever did the Russian convoys or anything like that?\n\n01:54:17\n\nI did two Russian convoys but not all the way the Skate was so small that\nshe never had the fuel she only… I think she carried about four hundred\nton of fuel she was very good she was very fast boat she could do thirty six\nknots you think that she weighed nine hundred ton and thirty six knots she\ncould do.\n\n01:54:45\n\nWhat was it like being onboard when she was doing that were you\never on deck when she did that sort of speed?\n\n01:54:49\n\nNo… mostly if she was doing that speed I’d be down the boiler room.\n\n01:54:55\n\nThat’s a very quick boat isn’t it?\n\n01:54:57\n\nYeah… when you look at the Cossack the Cossack was a thousand eight\nhundred ton well the Skate was nine hundred ton\n\n01:55:11\n\nAnd so yeah just what’s your recollection of any of the convoys that\nyou did and the sight you know what you saw in these convoys?\n\n\n\n01:55:17\n\nWell the thing was that…\n\n01:55:20\n\nWere you ever worried about U-Boats as well?\n\n01:55:22\n\nWell we had that we always had U-Boat trouble you know when you came\noff watch and you went to your hammock for sleep and that you were\nalready ready so you got straight out if the alarms went you didn’t have to\ndress or anything you were already dressed for that, but you know you get\nan alarm go off and everybody would dash to their respective stations and\nthen they be dropping depth charges or whatever you had against them\n\n01:56:02\n\nDid you ever see a U-Boat?\n\n01:56:05\n\nNot until after the war… no not after no… not until VE Day and we had to\ngo and round them up in the Atlantic and bring them in what was left of\nthem because by that time the German U-Boats were in a very bad state\nthey had lost seven hundred boats\n\n** Start of Film 8\n\n01:56:29\n\nOk so after the Skate what happened next?\n\n01:56:33\n\nWell then I went up to Ayr and Troon and picked up a brand new frigate\nH.M.S Loch Tarbert we commissioned her we went round took her round to\nTobermory were they had an admiral there who was still specific training\nfor escort vessels and then we joined the Atlantic convoys again and we\nwere in Liverpool coming from sea we were in Liverpool when VE Day\ncame now the Loch Tarbert was a brand new ship she was prefabricated\npieces were built everywhere and then shipped up to Troon and then they\nbuilt put it down the dock and welded them together but we had a problem\nwith her that we always had the port engine always run a bearing and\nthese bearings were quite big there about that wide and that size you know\nwere the shaft went through because they were reciprocating engines,\nthey weren’t turbines like the other ships were these were reciprocating\nand we always ran bearings no matter how we turned soon as we turned\nas soon as we got up to a certain speed we ran a bearing\n\n01:58:02\n\nWhat does ran a bearing mean?\n\n\n\n\n01:58:04\n\nWell it’s when the metal goes inside the bearing you got… there white\nmetal lined and the friction and that… that used to go in the bearing then\nwhich slap so it’s like well you can fancy it couldn’t you… every time we got\nback in harbour people came aboard our people mixed with them we done\nthe bearings putting in new linings and various gods no what and we kept\nthis up for… till we got to Malta we left Liverpool and we got to Gibraltar\nand the bearings had gone again we got round to Malta bearings had gone\nagain and this Maltese engineer came aboard he was going to do the\nrepairs and he’s having a good look around and he said that engines out of\nline you got your pistons… your pistons the engine I suppose was about\nfrom the window to about here and nearly as high reciprocating engine and\nthe piston were each were a separate piston and what had happened they\nhadn’t been lined up properly so every time we went to sea and you started\ndoing a little bit of speed so you got this trouble and it took that Maltese\nchap to realise that problem was there we never run a bearing after that.\n\n01:59:49\n\nWhat was it… Malta was after VE Day was it?\n\n01:59:54\n\nYeah we were on our way out to the Far East then.\n\n01:59:58\n\nWhat was… what do you remember of VE Day?\n\n02:00:00\n\nVE Day well we were in Liverpool at that time and it was hell to play in the\nevening one thing that a… really I don’t think you should record this\nactually the British soldiers were having a go at the Yankee soldiers they\nwere as soon as they got some beer in them they were fighting like hell\nwhich was sad but everybody was so happy you know everybody was\ncheerful and that\n\n02:00:37\n\nCan you remember how you felt?\n\n02:00:38\n\nOh felt well you know because that part of the war had finished and we\nhadn’t been a… about a day later we were outside rounding up these\nGerman U-Boats bringing them in\n\n02:00:53\n\nWhat was your recollection of seeing a U-Boat for the first time… it\nmust have been a bizarre sight I mean you know?\n\n02:00:59\n\nWell the thing is with a U-Boat your used to your own submarines yourself\nthere was no effect on you that way except they were painted in German\ncolours because we operated in the Med before the war with submarines\nwe had a big flotilla of submarines at that time so submarines were part\nand parcel part of everyday life really\n\n02:01:27\n\nDid you meet any of the… you know the German crew?\n\n02:01:32\n\nNo some of our chaps did because they had to go as boarding party you\nknow.\n\n\nSo you stayed on after the war?\n\n02:01:40\n\nYeah from…\nWas that all part of your plan because you joined before the war?\n\n02:01:49\n\nWell I had twelve years to do I’d signed on for twelve years but on the Loch\nTarbert when we were in Liverpool after VE Day one day we went out for\nand exercise with one of the monitors that’s these heavy gun… they carry\ntwo heavy guns fifteen inch guns and there good for going up rivers and we\nhad to go out and do an exercise with her and we crewed up in Gibraltar\nthen we crewed up in Malta then we crewed up in Alexandra and then we\nwere out in the Far East then we were operating from Trincomalee which\nwas then Ceylon and the day the Japanese chucked in we were outside\nwith the fleet cos we were an escort vessel, we were outside with the fleet\nthey were going to invade Singapore, but that day the Japs chucked in so\nthat was ok. So we had more celebrations\n\n02:03:00\n\nAnd then after that we went down we were called in an emergency to go\ntoo Indonesia because the Indonesians were fighting the Dutch so we had\nto go down there and see to it and we took a I think it was Ghurkha\nregiment down with us because these rebels had taken over the airport\nand everything and we were down there for several days the Ghurkhas\nwent out did their job they got the airport back and while we were tied up\nalongside the jetty in Surabaya we were continually getting shelled by\nmortars but fortunately none of them hit us at all\n\n02:03:51\n\nDo you remember Indonesia?\n\n02:03:54\n\nNot a lot but I was the chief stokers handyman I was his upper deck stoker\nPO, what they called them and anything that happened I had to do he\nwould say to me we got this to do and that and one day these mortars\ncame over about two hundred yards from us and they landed in a pile of\nraw rubber and they set this rubber on fire and I was sent out with a crowd\nof blokes to put the fire out well we had… there was no means there we\ncouldn’t get any water and that so all we did was went round this pile of\nrubber and dug this earth up and chucked it on the top and when we left\nabout four days later it was still smouldering but it wasn’t burning Yeah the\nIndonesians were having a go at the Dutch they didn’t want the Dutch\nback.\n\n\n\n\n02:05:01\n\nI had to go in the dockyard one day I forget it was… is this Surabaya?\nThis was in Surabaya and when I came back to the ship there was crowds\nand crowds of women and kids around the boat and they were the women\nfrom the local village and what had happened when the Japs arrived there\nthey took the men away and put them in camps for work and left the\nwomen in the village and they said you look after us and you’ll be alright so\nyou had young Japanese children and that and all these women and that\nand they came down the boat for safety well we had to provide them with\nfood well the skipper had a bath so our chaps got round they scrubbed this\nbath out they got a steam jet put it in the bath and filled it up with tins of\nveg and that and made a big stew for these people and the two cooks\nbaked bread and that so we catered for them for about three days and then\na landing craft came in from Singapore and took them all away\n\n02:06:28\n\nThat must have been a special experience for you?\n\n02:06:32\n\nYeah… it was to see all… when I come back walking along there gets\ninside the ship there all these women and that. There were Dutch,\nIndonesian mixed race and that and a lot of the women there had small\nJapanese babies well they had no option if they didn’t toe the line they got\nno food\n\n** Start of Film 9\n\n02:07:00\n\nWhat was your feeling towards inverted commas the enemy by this\npoint?\n\n02:07:05\n\nWell it’s very funny you know when you look at things you got to go back to\nthe Munich Crisis there we were two ships which would if the crisis had\ncome into war we would have been fighting each other two days later we\nwere playing football with them. There’s a friendship in the sea that you\ndon’t get with the Army of the Air Force there’s such a comradeship\nbetween all nations at sea. I would say you sink a ship like the Bismarck,\nwhen the Bismarck went down there was a lot of men in the water I think\nthe Dorsetshire I think sunk her they went around picking up survivors until\nthey got a submarine scare and then they just vanished and that’s why\nthey lost so many of the crew there, they actually had a crew over two\nthousand and only two hundred were saved (actual figures 2,200 men, only\n114 survived) she was a massive ship\n\n02:08:22\n\nWas she bigger than the Hood?\n\n02:08:23\n\nYes she was bigger than the Hood and… I don’t know what her actual\ntonnage was but she was bigger than the Hood. The Hood weighed forty\nfour thousand tons so I would say the Bismarck must have been around\nsixty thousand tons\n\n02:08:44\n\nSo after Loch Tarbert were you back to the UK then?\n\n\n\n02:08:55\n\nWe finished out the Far East then after a while we with the state of our\nboat, they were built for long journeys out to the Far East using the\nexperience the Americans were had to during the war we used their\nexperience we built the ship and you carried a lot of fuel and then when the\nfuel was being used up you had ballast tanks which you filled with salt\nwater well one day I had to go aft they wanted the ballast tank I couldn’t get\nthe valve to open I managed to get in the tank itself had somebody come\nalong I went down with a face mask on with a long hose up into the fresh\nair and couldn’t free the valve at all so that meant to say that tank was\nuseless then so that’s the first thing that went wrong.\n\n02:10:00\n\nNo ballast tanks and we were doing a harbour duties and they had one\ndynamo running, we had no auxiliary dynamo we had just two steam\ndynamos so you always had to have steam in the ship and this steam\ndynamo which was a reciprocating engine something went wrong with the\nelectrical side and the governor went on the steam side and the two of\nthem working against each other they snapped that shaft off… that shaft\nwas about that round and it sheared it off so we were down then to one\ndynamo so after a while they said well get her back to England scrap her,\nwhich they did do and she was only what… eighteen month old and she\nwas useless\n\n02:10:58\n\nSo then I come back to England I was sent back to barracks and a little\nwhile later I got a draft chit to H.M.S Concord she was a new… she was a\nwar destroyer being finished off she was one of the last it had been built in\nWoolston in Southampton which did me very well living in Eastleigh and\nthen we went out to the Far East not much trouble there we had… we were\nmore or less stopping drug runners and various things and we went up the\nYangtze and on the way back from the Yangtze we went to Hong Kong and\nI was fuelling the forehead tanks and an officer sent for me and he said or\na message came you got to see the officer so and so I got to him he said\nI’d like you to pack your bags and that go over to the cox aid you got a\nsteamer back to England, and I said well what if I want to sign on he said\nyou’ll have to do that when you get there so I steamed the cox aid back out\nto England from then on I had my leave and left the Navy.\n\n02:12:26\n\nHow was that… how was that leaving the Navy after all that time?\n\n02:12:31\n\nWell it was awkward but I had a young family and I thought I’d sooner have\ntime with them than being around at sea I couldn’t get any higher than I\nwas I got… I was a chief at the time\n\n02:12:50\n\nDid it take some adapting?\n\n02:12:54\n\nWell not really because I had… I was on leave from the 27 th of December\nuntil about the 12th of April I was on leave they owed me so much leave\n\n\n\n\n02:13:10\n\nWhat was it like though you know it’s almost ten years you dabbled in\nEngland but it’s been a long time since you lived in England how\ndifferent was it?\n\n02:13:21\n\nWell I think the thing that helped me was the fact I had the wife and the\nchildren my mother and stepfather lived locally you know and I just blended\nin with them. My whole nature is I can blend in with anybody even today I\nyou know I’m getting about I look after the club here and various things if\nanybody needs help I’m there and I’m the second oldest chap here…\nsecond oldest person here\nYou don’t strike me as a man with high stress levels?\nNo…\n\n02:13:58\n\nThat’s what you need to be on a boat isn’t it… Lord West was saying\nthat to us actually that you don’t what big personalities necessarily\nyou want people that are you know… fly below the radar get on with\neverybody?\n\n02:14:19\n\nYou got to be able to adapt yourself and when you get on ships and that\nyou got a different thing altogether it’s a different life from one ship to the\nother it’s totally different because the attitude of the people. The Hood was\nan exceptionally happy ship there’s no doubt about it she was a great ship\nwe were on her at the wrong time Spanish war we never went past Greece\nwhen we were out there our run was between Greece and Gibraltar we\nmanaged to get home for the coronation 1937 then we went back to the\nMed\n\n02:15:13\n\nEnd of Films\n\n\n", "label": []}

From the fishponds area… where I was born. And I went\nto school in Bristol. And started my work, after school, in Bristol.\n\n01:00:23\n\nHow old were you when war broke out?\nUmm, well, I was born in 1919, so I was twenty.\n\n01:00:31\n\nWhat was life like for you in Bristol, I mean, just tell me a bit about your\nschooling and just life in Bristol, so I understand who you are?\nUmm, I originally went to a small private school, umm, and then went to\ncoleston from there and umm, it… Bristol itself I found rather dull, you know.\nIt was all pubs and churches. That’s how it seemed to me, you know, there\nweren’t the lovely, fun things that there are for young people today. We spent\nmost of our time either going to, our free time going to the cinema, or playing\nsome kind of games, you know, I belonged to various hockey teams and\ntennis clubs. And, umm, during the war, umm, of course we worked very long\nhours, umm, and late so you weren’t looking for much leisure fun. And I\nmoved because of the Bristol Blitz, during that time. Umm, I was put up by\nthe firm, they didn’t want us in the danger of central Bristol and so on, and so\nthey took over a cottage in Chipping Sodbury, and I lived in Chipping\nSodbury, for a couple of years. That was quite good fun, actually, the sort of\nvillage life – lots going on. But I’d always had a yearning to go into the Navy\nwhen the war broke out. Mainly ‘cause I had friends who had joined the\nservices.\n\n01:02:15\n\nWas it… Was it WRNS over any other service?\nYeah, I didn’t want to join… Do you mean… err?\n\n01:02:24\n\nWAAF or ATS or anything?\nNo, no, no. My particular friend went into the WAAF and she had a very\ninteresting time as… out in Washington, err, working for the Naval… not\nNaval, the air force.\n\n01:02:40\n\nThe WRNS was the right choice then?\n\n\nYes, yes. Liked the uniform too!\n\n01:02:44\n\nYeah. Just tell me a bit about Yate and what you were doing there and\nthe… the work and stuff?\nUmm, well as secretary to the chief designer in the beginning, it was a\nquestion of doing typing. He would dictate his design, umm, reports, ‘cause\nit all had to go up to the air ministry for approval, err, ‘cause they were looking\nfor a, umm, an order for these planes of course, and it was typing all these\nsheets of description of these planes. Umm, and that, I mean to say he was\na very un-disciplined man in that he left everything to the last minute, so one\nwas working quite late at night, very often, to get it done to the deadline that\nthe ministry had set.\n\n01:03:37\n\nWhat was his name?\nBasil Henderson. And he designed the small plane called the umm, what did\nthey call it? Umm... The Hendy… It was a breakdown of his name. But it was\nBasil Hen… It’ll come to me, but it was round about the time that there was\numm, another chap designing those small planes, umm, I can’t think of his\nname now. But that would have been in about 1937/38.\n\n01:04:18\n\nDid you have a sense that war was coming?\nUmm, not really no, I mean to say the boys that we used to meet and mix\nwith were mostly umm, air force types, or going… interested in the air force\nand we knew they… It was the 501 squadron, the… at Filton, umm, that most\nof them flew with. Umm, and we knew at times that… from their conversation\nthat things were getting very near. But, umm, not really, you know we weren’t\nputting up the barricades or anything!\n\n** Start of Film 2\n\n01:05:05\n\nWhat about the outbreak of war, do you remember that?\nI do, we were actually on Filton aerodrome when it… that Sunday when they\nannounced it, watching these lads in their planes taking off, purely for\nexercise.\n\n01:05:21\n\nSo did things change in Bristol, when war broke out? What was the\nchange, do you remember?\nI can’t honestly say because most of my life was spent between Fishponds\nand Yate, you know, I very rarely went the other way towards town, and didn’t\nreally get any feeling of what things were like. Even, you know, I read now\nabout some of the ghastly things that happened in the bombing, you know,\nthe loss of life. But it didn’t affect me directly. Umm, my parents had a shop\nin Fishponds and they still kept going, you know, in a quiet sort of way.\n\n\n01:06:03\n\nWhat is said\nDid you see the Blitz? Did you see… were you in… were you in Yate\nwhen it happened?\nYeas, I was in Yate, yeah. And that was one of the reasons why the firm\nmoved us, to live in Yate, so we didn’t have the business of travelling, umm,\nbut we did have a daylight raid in Yate and that was very traumatic. There\nwas… they sent a single plane, I mean we were all working away quite\nhappily and the air-raid siren went, and err, I was being taught how to play\nbridge, by the friend who went into the air force, and umm, we didn’t take any\nnotice of the air-raid siren because we never had anything and suddenly\nthere was the most almighty explosion, and the whole building shook. What\nhad happened, a single plane had come in, apparently it came in from\nsomewhere in the northern France area where the German’s had, umm,\nairports, and it had flown up the Bristol channel to somewhere north of\nGloucester, picked up the railway line and Yate runs along the railway line,\nyou know, the building, and flew down and dropped this strip of bombs along\nthe factory. Fortunately a couple of them didn’t go off and I think it was about\nfifty seven people were killed, and it was my first experience of seeing a dead\nbody, because I knew most of the people in the factory because of who I was\nworking for and one of the other people living in the house in Chipping\nSodbury was a woman called Sister Hobbs who became quite well known for\nthe work she did in that Blitz. And she just caught hold of me and she said\n‘come on, we’ve got to go up to the brick factory’ she said, to identify these\npeople who’ve been killed. And you know, I was taken, but also I… it was\n1941, so I was 22. At 22 to see all these disintegrated bodies, and I hadn’t\nseen a dead body before, and that was very traumatic.\n\n01:08:26\n\nYeah, was that, do you think, a catalyst for thinking I want to join…\nbecome a WRN then?\nNo, I don’t think so, no. No, that was quietly simmering away. And, I think the\ncatalyst in the end was when my boss moved. He went to a firm, which again\nyou may know of, Boosey and Hawkes. They, umm, he wasn’t a musician or\nhe hadn’t made musical instruments ‘cause that was the job they did,\noriginally, they were making spare parts for some of our gun turrets. And\nthey, umm, found that he was a man who could design what they wanted.\nAnd umm, they got him, they head hunted him, and when he left, I wasn’t too\nhappy with the person who got the job and I thought I want to move. But I\nhad to work quite hard to get into the WRNS because, of course, I was in a\nreserved occupation.\n\n01:09:27\n\nI was going to ask was it a… I assumed it was a reserved occupation,\nso you had to go through the procedure to get out?\n\n\n\nYes. And there weren’t… the WRNS weren’t open for recruitment anyhow.\nAnd at that time we were being, umm, drawn, I suppose is the word, for a…\nthe… by a war artist. A man called Leopold Freedman, who I haven’t been\nable to run to earth since, I have tried, because he did like a mural of people\nworking in the factory and it went to the, umm, National Art… What’s the one\nin Trafalgar Square? National Art Gallery in Trafalgar Square, umm, and I\nwas sitting, you know, while he was drawing me and talking to him and I said\nI wanted to join the WRNS, the problem was there were no vacancies and I\nwas in a reserved occupation. So he gave me the name of a woman, again,\nI’ve forgotten her name, but she was the head of the Ministry of Labour in\nLondon, so I go off to London to see this woman and she told me the sort of\ninside secret that I ought to be able to get in fairly soon because the WRNS\nwere expanding and they expanded very rapidly and I got in very easily then.\nBut I had to wait ‘til the doors opened. Of course the Lords of the Admiralty\ndidn’t want women. You know, they reluctantly took them in at the beginning\nof the war, but, you know, it was a man’s service. It wasn’t for women.\n\n** Start of Film 3\n\n01:11:08\n\nBrilliant. So what was the process then from… transitioning from being\na secretary in Yate to becoming a Wren? What do you remember of it?\nYeah, I remember, err, you know, having my papers and being sent to Leeds\nbecause… because they suddenly expanded, err, they had to open new\ntraining depots. I was in my early twenties and, umm, I had what they call a\nwhite paper, umm, which was a recommendation for a commission as soon\nas you were interviewed originally, you know. Most girls have to wait and\nwork a while, but I was older and I think they saw me as a possible admin\nofficer, well they did actually. But then I went from Leeds after I did my basic\ntraining to Rochester, which is really in the Chatham. Now I had seen myself\nas boats crew, you know, because I was a Bristolian I wanted to go to\nPlymouth, which was the uh… But the Navy had other ideas, so they sent\nme to be… to go to training for an admin officer at Chatham really. Anyhow,\nI… they put me in what’s called the regulating office, which is, you know,\nwhere you monitor people coming in and going out and telephones. And,\numm, I always remember that the first officer, who was the one in charge,\nwas a very, very jolly woman, umm, and she was the daughter of somebody\ncalled Lady Burtonshaw? who lived in Hove and every Saturday afternoon\nLady Burtonshaw would ring up her daughter, just for a chat and I was put\non the telephone. Well, I’d never, never worked at a… you know those plug\nin telephones, I’d never worked one of those, and of course Lady Burtonshaw\ncomes through and I was a… panic, you know, I wasn’t very confident about\nit. Of course what do I do in the very middle of their conversation, I pull the\nplug out, you see. So I had to go in, she called me in and she said ‘who was\non the telephone’, so I said’ It was me ma’am’, so she said ‘You are nothing\nbut a broken reed’. And I thought, well nobody’s ever called me a broken\nreed before! But you know, it did me the world of good. I thought I was God’s\ngift to the Navy, you see, and I wasn’t at all! But that remark, really has stuck\nwith me all my life.\n\n01:13:46\n\nWhat is said\nWere you, excuse me for asking, were you a Chatham rating?\nYes.\n\n01:13:53\n\nOkay.\nI suppose I was. Nor?? command, it was.\n\n01:13:59\n\nDid you go to Chatham?\nWell, not… only in sort of… to visit because we were billeted in Rochester.\nAnd because I was doing the admin work in the office, the office was attached\nto the billet.\n\n01:14:17\n\nHow did you find moving ‘round the country? Had you been out of\nBristol at this point?\nUmm, I… not very far, no. That was another thing, you didn’t travel far, you\nknow, holidays were… well the furthest we went was Tenby, in south Wales.\nBut I had been to London, umm, and I had been to France on a school trip,\numm, once. But no, not very far. We weren’t very well off anyhow as a family,\nyou know, we had to cut our corners.\n\n01:14:52\n\nSo after Rochester then, where did you… where did you go then?\nWell, when I was at Rochester, the first officer, I was telling you called me a\n‘broken reed’, umm, I was in the… what do they call it now? Sort of, the office\nwhich allocated postings to the girls, ‘cause all the girls there were waiting to\nbe sent somewhere, umm, and I was there, and nothing came in, ‘cause I\nwas looking through all the different things that came in from the Admiralty\nand nothing came in I was interested in. I was down for admin and then I\nfound that to do admin I had to go to, umm, Lowestoft, to the Captain’s office\nwhere they trained admin officers. And I found that there was a long waiting\nlist, and I thought, ‘well I didn’t join the Navy to sit in an office and wait for\nthat’. So I was given the opportunity to go and I said no, so they said ‘well\nyou realise you’ll go to the bottom of the list’. I said ‘well, I didn’t join to have\na commission anyhow, you know, I joined to do a job’. So she said to me if\nyou see anything coming through, umm, it was a teleprinter in those days, let\nme know and I’ll see, I said well, all I know is I don’t want to work in London,\nI don’t mind where else I go and, you know, I’d like to stick with my shorthand\nand sort of general office work. Okay, she said, so… in comes…\n\n\n\nIt was at the time when General Eisenhower was, umm, getting to be quite\nwell known as a commander and he set up, if you remember, SHAEF, and I\nlooked it… and I… something came in with ANCXF/SHAEF, and I thought\n‘well, that’s interesting’ and at the ANCXF was the Allied Naval Commander\nExpeditionary force and that was Admiral Ramsey. And I thought, ‘well that\nsounds interesting’, you know, so I went to her and I said could I have my\nname put up for that vacancy. And so she agreed and, you know, you had to\ntake your chance what other applications they had and, umm, I got it! And I\nsaid where is it? So she said, well to start with you’ll have to go to Norfolk\nSquare in London, which is the headquarters of SHAEF, and the ANCXF\ngroup were collecting there, umm, and they were mostly WRNS who were\ngoing to do the D-Day planning. But I got… because I put in for\nANCXF/SHAEF I got attached to the… this is where Admiral Parry came in,\nto Admiral Parry who, typically British, we hadn’t started D-Day but they were\nalways… already post-operative planning! And I couldn’t believe this, I\nthought, well we haven’t won the war, why are they planning for the future?\nYou see, and that’s what I was caught up in then, from then on. I was\nattached to him and sent to Bushy Park in Hertfordshire. Not Hertfordshire,\numm, it’s near Hampton Court Palace. And it was General Eisenhower’s\nheadquarters for… they were collecting all the more administrative people\nthere, you know, while the troops were being collected around Kent and\nSussex and places. Sorry, it’s me nerves!\n\n01:18:41\n\nYou’re doing brilliantly. It’s amazing, trust me, don’t worry.\nUmm, and I thought, oh I don’t want to go to London, but anyhow, in the end\nthey said well you’ll only be hold… held there until umm, and I was only held\nthere a day. I remember sitting on the wall outside Norfolk House, which is\nwhere the London group were and told to wait and somebody would pick me\nup ‘cause from then on it became highly secretive. And I was sitting like a\nlonely Wren with my naval case and nothing else and a jeep came zooming\nround the square and an American stopped by me and he said ‘are you WRN\nIrene Ballamy goin’ to Bushy Park?’ Well, I said ‘I don’t know where I’m going,\nI’ve just been told to sit on this wall!’ So he said… he got me aboard his jeep\nand we went through that bit It wasn’t far from Norfolk to get out of London,\nwent to Bushy Park.\n\n01:19:46\n\nBet that was a fun journey!\nAnd of course, when I get to Bushy Park I’m the only Wren there, because it\nwas a separate unit to the big group that were at Norfolk House.\n\n01:19:58\n\nWhat year was that?\nErr, be 44, I think, 44/45.\n\n** Start of Film 4\n\n\n01:20:04\n\nWhat is said\nI mean, just describe the set up at Bushy Park and what you were doing\nthere before D-Day?\nWell, Bushy Park, umm, is… I presume it’s a sort of local… it’s a very large\npark and in it were porta cabins in which, by then you’d got the British and\nthe French, err, and Americans. Who were the fourth ones? Not the…\n\n01:20:38\n\nCanadians?\nNo, yes, well there were a few but not many. I was thinking of the group that\nthey split Germany up into regions, didn’t they, there was the British…\n\n01:20:51\n\nRussian?\nRussian. But I can’t remember Russians being at Bushy Park, I think they\nlinked up later. Umm, but I remember being in one of these… we had our\noffice and this is where… I didn’t actually, couldn’t say I met him, but the\ndoodlebugs had started flying and, umm, we… they’d got… they had Bushy\nPark in their sights and they got very near us, but so there were air raid\nshelters built specially and a lot of the Americans, particularly the women in\nthe American army had never experienced anything like it before – they just\nwent to pieces if there was an air raid! They were a terribly nervous lot. But I\nquite enjoyed being with them because it was a different lifestyle altogether.\nTheir method and the equipment they gave us, you know and the hygiene\nwas put in. So I was really… I was under air… umm, ATS supervision, err\nand somebody called Lady Brecknock? I think she became quite a power in\nthe Land afterwards from a political point of view, but she was in charge of\nus and she… and I resented her because she… she used to open my post,\nwhich of course the Navy never opened your post, but because I was under\nATS rule, all our post was opened. Umm, and Lady Brecknock always made\na point of reading and remembering what was in them and I was always\nsending home for money! And err, she was always saying you know, ‘you\ndon’t need money, you’ve got plenty, you know, you should manage on what\nyou’ve got.’ And that was seven and six a week. So from there…\n\n01:22:54\n\nDid you meet Eisenhower?\nWell, yes and no. I was talking about the Doodlebugs, umm, and if he was\non sight, umm, in his office, he didn’t come very often ‘cause of course the…\nhis responsibility was enormous and the places, you know, people said ‘oh\nEisenhower was there’ but they were never there for long. Umm, but he did\nuse the air raid shelter, which was the same shelter that we used because\nwe were in the joining offices. Umm, but you know, he hardly saw us,\nbecause he’d pop down and all his entourage would be with him. Err, but, I\nmean to say we didn’t feel we were lesser than him, you know, he always\nhad a word to say, but you can’t really say you met him, you know.\n\n01:23:46\n\nWhen did Admiral Parry come onto the scene?\n\n\nUmm, not actually until I went across to France, because in the mean time\nhis… one of his sidekicks was a Captain Owen, who had been the\nPortuguese… umm, it wasn’t an attaché, the Naval representative in Lisbon,\numm and so when he joined us on the staff of Admiral Parry, I was attached\nto him and he always called me his minina. Do you know, I’ve never actually\nspoken to a Portuguese to find out, I was told it meant friend, but I was always\nthinking… He always told people if they wanted something ‘go and ask my\nminina.’ But he was a very gentle, very nice man, who… about whom I\nknew… never heard much about him at all. I know Admiral Parry, umm, at\nthe end of the war, umm, I think he… he was an apple grower in Kent, and\nthat’s what, in his retirement that’s what he did. But Captain Owen I never\nknew.\n\n01:25:05\n\nWhat did you sense? What did you know about this escalation towards\nD-Day? How, sort of, privy to it were you?\nOh, absolutely, because, you know, although I wasn’t in the typing pool, as it\nwas, umm, I knew… I’d seen papers going through and you knew what the\nplanning was.\n\n01:25:28\n\nAnd you say it was top secret, what… just describe the secrecy\nprocess. What did you have to do in order to be let in?\nWell it was, umm, BIGOT (British Invasion of German Occupied) was the\nthird level, which was the absolutely… I don’t think we could ever get through,\nbut there were special lines and things on the telephone and it was mostly\nfor use by telephone, but I never really knew how they decided, umm, I knew\nwhen I had to… if I had to make a call which line I had to use, whether it was\nthe ordinary one, the top secret or BIGOT, but I never knew when, say\nCaptain Owen was wanting me to do something and he said ‘that’ll be\nBIGOT’ how he knew it had to be BIGOT, you know. That was something\nknown to him.\n\n** Start of Film 5\n\n01:26:27\n\nIs BIGOT above top secret?\nYes.\n\n01:26:29\n\nJust describe what your job was. What were you actually doing?\nPredominantly?\n\n\n\nI was in London, wasn’t I? Well, mainly doing the Admiral’s or Captain Owen,\nwhichever one was around, doing the, umm, their post and taking dictation\nand what planning they had to do in terms of post-op. Most of the post\noperative stuff was the division of the German Navy when the war was over,\nyou know, who was going to have what, and that was interesting, because of\ncourse the Russians wanted everything… this was much further on, when\nwe were in Berlin. But the Russians always wanted all the big stuff, you know,\nand we knew all the best equipment was in the smaller destroyers and things,\nso, umm, we went for those. So, you know, they were working out all those\nsort of things and of course it all had to go up through the admiralty and back\nagain, so it all took time. But it was just straightforward short-hand reporting\nof the post operative planning.\n\n01:27:45\n\nEven before D-Day?\nYeah.\n\n01:27:47\n\nDid you ever meet any… you know, were there any other like Churchill,\nany of the other big wigs?\nNever saw Churchill. Montgomery, umm, when we were in Germany, it was\nthe fashion to have a dog. I never had one, but umm, my friend had one\nwhich she called Frat, ‘cause that of course was no fraternisation. And I\nremember we… we had an office, we were in Frankfurt at the time, and the\noffice there had a sort of staircase going up and Paddy always took Frat to\nwork with her. Nobody minded ‘cause the war was over by then. And, err, we\nwere going upstairs one day and somebody said ‘watch out, Montgomery’s\ncoming’ and he was in the building, at some meeting and he was coming\nagain with his entourage down the stairs as we were going up, you see. And,\numm, apparently, he didn’t do it in front of us, but, umm, when he got back\nto his office he told his adjutant to contact whoever was responsible for the\nWrens to say he didn’t want dogs in the building. Typical!\n\n01:29:15\n\nSo, if you were very privy to all this stuff, when did you know it was\ngoing to be June 5th or 6th? Did you know that?\nUmm, well yes because, you know, of the delay. Do you mean D-Day? Yeah.\nBecause of the delay, with, you know, yeah.\n\n01:29:32\n\nSo you knew that… that this was going to be the day that the landings\nwere happening? Did you ever…\n\n\n\nYes. Well, it was… you did and you didn’t, you know. There were always\nthings being said to put you off, so that you weren’t a hundred percent sure.\nBut, I don’t suppose anybody was really because of the weather and things,\nbut we were…when I was at Chatham and there wasn’t, you know, we’d done\nall the work we had to do, that we were waiting, umm, we were sent cherry\npicking in the Kent orchards, and that was amazing because all the lanes\nand roads all round, sort of Kent and the sort of area going down to the coast\nwere full of army vehicles and men waiting. You knew that they were there\nready to go! But I think that’s how I know rather than through the office.\n\n01:30:32\n\nSo after Bushy Park, you went back to Chatham, did you? Or back over\nto…\nBushy Park, I’ve got to get this, ‘cause I did so many things! Umm, no from\nBushy Park, umm, we were moved back to London and I worked in Princes\nGardens there. And we lived in England’s lane, in… in sort of… England’s\nLane it’s sort of Swiss Cottage way. And there was a nurses’ home there, I\nthink it was the cherry cross nurses’ home and they used that for WRN billet.\nAnd then we used to travel to Princes Gardens from there, and it was from\nPrinces Gardens that I was drafted over to France.\n\n** Start of Film 6\n\n01:31:28\n\nCan you remember how you felt when you found out you’d be going,\nfollowing the expedition?\nI was a bit disappointed ‘cause I felt that my… I am still, that my Naval life\nwas anything but Navy, you know, ‘cause I had great… great ideas of being\nboats crew, as I said, and going to sea with the mail?. So I was a bit\ndisappointed that it was going to be in land, as it were. But once I’d got used\nto it, and there was a certain adventure as well in going over.\n\n01:32:06\n\nDid you sail to France?\nWe went over… you know those, umm… boats they took the troops over in,\nthe… we went over. Actually, umm, when it came to it the war was… the\narmy was almost in Berlin by then, so they felt it was safe to put the girls\nover. And we went across to a little town in Normandy called Granville on the\numm, well ducks we called them, you know DUK, those, like landing craft.\nAnd I was terribly sick. I may say it proved to me I wasn’t a sailor anyway!\n\n01:32:47\n\nDescribe the sort of… the day that you went on the landing crafts to\nFrance. Just going back a little bit on the story and what you remember\nof… you know, that day. Where did you sail from and what was the\nweather like etc, can you remember?\n\n\n\nYes, the weather wasn’t too good, hence the fact that I was sick. Umm, I\nsuppose… I think there were probably nearly… between fifty and a hundred\nof us going. Not only WRNS, but others. Umm, trying to think. We went from\none of the little ports. They weren’t really ports, they were around the\nBeaulieu river, that way. Umm, we were excited, we didn’t… you know, you\nhad all sorts of imaginations of what might happen crossing the channel –\nmight sink, you know and you’d be able to swim far enough, and you know,\nwe didn’t have to go through water when we got the other side like you see\nthe men, you know trailing out with all their stuff through water. They\nmanaged to beach us, so we were quite dry when we got to the other side.\nAnd, you know, the French actually in Normandy were very accommodating\nand they were very pleased to see us. They were very different, in my view,\nto the ones we met in Paris.\n\n01:34:19\n\nWhat… was it obviously war-torn?\nOh yes. Yes, you know, the umm… because it would be after D-Day of\ncourse that we went across, so things were still pretty, umm, broken, you\nknow and all the, sort of front line houses and things were all bashed about,\nbecause they’d been bombarded of course from the sea.\n\n01:34:49\n\nAnd Granville, what was the set up there, and you… you know, you’re\nstill in a war zone, basically, aren’t you?\nIt was a war zone. Well, it was just a sort of getting off point for moving people\non behind the army, I think it was felt to be a reasonable place to start moving,\n‘cause we had a lot of equipment as well. We didn’t but the army and the air\nforce and the navy for that matter all had equipment to move up with us. And\nI think Granville probably as a little town was considered, you know they had,\numm, good roads… not good, but the transport situation, moving stuff was\nreasonable. But very basic living conditions, you know, we had no running\nwater or umm, we had sort of things like your tripod with canvass bags in\nthem which we used as washing… err, machines, well… umm for washing.\nWhat else was there? It was like camping really, from the living point of view\nand very little work we had at that time.\n\n01:36:12\n\nAnd what… were you just writing or did you have teleprinters or\nanything like that? Was there any technology?\n\n\n\nOh yes, there was a lot of… but not in the group I was with, you know, the…\nactually the first people to go over were the communicators. The telephone\noperators and so on, umm, and of course they were still… the engineers\nwere still fitting up field equipment, when they arrived. And there were a lot\nof WRNS in that group. Tremendous number. And from Granville, you know,\nthey found the work they wanted me to do was more centred back in London,\nso I was shipped back to London, to wait until they’d prepared what we\nneeded, or I had to help do that. Umm, and we went then to Paris, but I went\nfrom London, from England’s Lane that was, to Paris on my own and then I\nreally was… I’d not been anywhere on my own before, and they… I was met\nwhen I got to the Gare du Nord, ‘cause I went over on the train, by another\nWren who’d been over. And then we were… I was billeted and worked in the\nchateau in, umm, it’s a suburb of Paris anyhow, and I worked there for a very\nshort time, and then the administrative group were following on behind the\narmy, and we went from, umm, Paris to Frankfurt and, umm, I didn’t enjoy\nFrankfurt very much because, umm, there wasn’t much to do by now, you\nknow, most of the planning had been done and life became rather, sort of,\nthere didn’t seem to be any point in what we were doing, we’d done it all, you\nknow, so it was a bit of a playground.\n\n01:38:32\n\nOkay, was this at the end of the… Is this after the war?\nYeah. Now this is the, umm, troops had entered Berlin, umm, and we were\nback in Paris, so it was sort of just as the war was ending. And yes it had\nended, because one of the things that struck me in Paris were the fashions,\nyou know, the most beautiful hats made out of cellophane paper, you know,\nsweet papers and things that the women had made. They seemed untouched\nby the war in Paris. They didn’t much like us, I don’t think! I think the Germans\nhad given them quite a good time.\n\n** Start of Film 7\n\n01:39:18\n\nWere you with Admiral Parry then, at this point?\nNo. I met Admiral Parry when I got to Paris.\n\n01:39:24\n\nAnd what was he like?\nAs a person very quiet, you know, you didn’t really feel, you know, he could\nhit anybody let alone kill anybody, but, umm, or even discipline anybody, he\nwas always very gentle and… and very nice to work for. But very clever, of\ncourse. He, umm, knew what he wanted.\n\n01:39:53\n\nAnd what… Just describe the sort of working relationship – what you\ndid for him and what the purpose of you being there was?\n\n\n\nUmm, do you mean… Umm, you see most of the… He, he really would have\ncommunicated to Captain Owen most of what he wanted, ‘cause he’d be off\ndoing something else. Umm, but… so that Captain Owen was really the\nperson who was giving me work, when there was work to be done, but\nAdmiral Parry certainly was very approachable and he mixed with us, there\nwas no sort of officers and others. Everybody mixed. And, err, he’s a difficult\nman to describe really.\n\n01:40:48\n\nThat’s nicely described, Irene…\nYou know, but the… when we were in Berlin, do you know Berlin at all, in the\nlakes in the Wannsee, the lakes that are on the outskirts. Well, when we were\nliving in what had been the, umm, Japanese Embassy in Berlin. The most\nbeautiful house and it was in that district where the lakes were – I always\nsaid the Wannsee lakes, and they would freeze over in the winter, ‘cause we\nhad a winter there and, you know, the admiral would arrange skating parties\nand, you know, of course the ice there is so thick because it’s so cool, that\nyou could have barbeques on the ice. And, you know, that’s when life\nbecame a bit superficial, latterly when there wasn’t much work to do, you\nknow, you really felt you should be somewhere doing some work!\n\n01:41:46\n\nAnd how did you get from Paris into Frankfurt? Were you on railways\nor were you in vehicles?\nOh, in Naval Jeeps. Most of the travelling we did. The only thing, when I went\nfrom Frankfurt to Berlin, I had been home on leave, and when I got back, it\nwas to find that… I don’t know why but they couldn’t notify me and couldn’t\nget hold of me to let me know that the main party had gone on to Berlin and\nit… when I got back to Frankfurt, I had to go and report to one of the army\nofficers to get transport. And when I got there I found a message to say that\nGeneral Eisenhower’s chauffeur had married one of our WRNS. I knew they\nwere very friendly before I went. And that he let them have his house in,\numm, near Frankfurt for their honeymoon and they were both due back in\nBerlin and they would give me a lift. So I went breezing up the autobahn from\nFrankfurt to Berlin in General Eisenhower’s car!\n\n01:43:06\n\nAmazing! And what was Berlin like? What was post-war Berlin like?\nAbsolutely devastated. Yeah. That really did shake me when I saw it, you\nknow, there was, almost every building we saw was destroyed and there\nwere these, and they weren’t necessarily old women, but they looked old,\n‘cause they were all hunched up, you know, in dark clothes with\nwheelbarrows clearing the streets. Working so hard and little food, you know,\nthey were working with very little strength. But, umm, I must give the\nGermans their due; they did work hard to get Berlin back.\n\n01:43:51\n\nDid you go to the Brandenburg Gate or ???\n\n\n\nOh yes. Yes.\n\n01:43:56\n\nTell me about some of that?\nWell, that again was more like a tourist trip, you know, we… I’ve been trying\nto think what our office in Berlin was like, and do you know… By then, of\ncourse, it was control commission, and, umm, I can’t visualise it at all, it’s an\nabsolute blank in my memory. I can remember the Wrenery, the Japanese\nEmbassy, and I can remember going on the tram from there to the office, but\nI can’t remember the office. At all! And I’m not… I was there for nearly a year.\nBut, umm, we went to see the bunker, you know, where Hitler was killed, and\nthat was still in, you know, pretty rough state, you know, bits of furniture were\nstill there, you know, it hadn’t been tidied up.\n\n** Start of Film 8\n\n01:44:59\n\nWhat was your sentiment towards the Germans at the time?\nWell, it was interesting because, umm, I found them very helpful, but then,\nand, you know, I quite liked them, but of course they had a lot to gain from\nus, in the way of food and so on. The Russians, of course, were the… the\nproblem. Because, I… The story goes that the main Russian army that took\nBerlin, they pulled them back and they replaced them with the sort of third\nline who were Mongolians, and they were pretty rough, and, umm, on one\noccasion coming home from the office, a couple, very… they used to drink\nan awful lot, any booze they could get hold of, a couple of very drunk\nRussians started… We were walking home from the office in Berlin to our\ndigs, and, umm, they started getting their guns out and shooting all over the\nplace, and we had to jump in a hedge and after that… to keep out of their\nway, and after that they put a fairly strong Marine presence on the road, you\nknow, a sort of guard on the… and we weren’t allowed to travel on our own.\nSo, we were pretty okay on transport, if we got the tram home, we were\nalright, it’s if you started walking. We had a German cook in the Wrenery,\nand he found it difficult to be pleasant to us, but he was, because of course\nhe… he used to collect our used tea bags and take them home and he knew\nthat if he didn’t, you know, treat us all properly, he’d get taken off and we’d\nget someone else and he’d lose out on his bits and pieces he was getting.\nAnd we also had an interesting maid, Franzeska, who was German. Not,\nsorry Jewish. And, umm, she had had a very bad time. She had legitimately\nbecome, well I say legitimately, but it was her boyfriend and not a German or\na Russian, err, pregnant and she had this baby in a cellar which she was\nhiding from because the Germans were still looking for Jews, even after the\nwar, and, err, anyhow, it was a Russian soldier who actually helped her have\nher baby in this cellar and, you know, who really rescued her. And then of\ncourse the British… We were in the British region, of course, but Franzeska\nused to have lessons in German for us, which… She was an educated Jew.\n\n\n01:48:11\n\nWhat is said\nSo you didn’t go to Potsdam?\nYes, umm, the Potsdam conference was held while I was in Berlin and\nAdmiral Parry, of course, had a… ‘cause the main purpose of Potsdam was\nto sort of finalise the break up of the German Navy, umm, and I went with\nCaptain Owen, because of course they’d done their work on the Navy to\ncontribute to that. I didn’t go in to the actual meeting hall, ‘cause it’s quite\nsmall actually, I was surprised. I’ve been back since and had another look at\nit, you know, and I thought yes it is small. But I went this time, you know,\nbecause I was driving as well, you know, so our group, umm, the Captain\nsaid if you’d like to go, you can go, but you won’t be able to go into the\nconference.\n\n01:49:08\n\nDid you know it was a significant moment in history?\nOh yes. I think you… you knew that, yes. You know, you saw Stalin and\nChurchill, you know, just as though you were a tourist watching!\n\n01:49:29\n\nYou talked a bit earlier about how the Navy knew more about the\nGerman Navy than the Russians. The Russians wanted the carriers, the\nBrits wanted the destroyers. Was there… You know, just sort of recap\non that. Was there any more of that discussion, sort of pre-Potsdam\nthat you can recall or was it all sort of done and dusted by then?\nNo, I don’t… I think they sort of…There was another, umm, Admiral Miles\nwas someone who appeared on the scene at, umm, before Potsdam, and he\nhad a lot to do with the, you know, sorting out the German Navy. But, umm…\nSorry I’ve forgotten what your question was now.\n\n01:50:16\n\nJust was there more discussion about, oh you know now we’ve heard\nabout the V2 rockets, we should be getting those rather than the\nRussians?\nNo, I think it was all done before hand. I don’t remember. I know there was,\nand I can’t remember what the… there was supposed to have been an\nincident when, now of course, I don’t mean Churchill I mean Atlee because\nit was at the Potsdam conference, you know, that Churchill, umm, lost his\nseat and Atlee came in and that meant… made a change of foreign secretary\nand it was… What was his name now, the big man? Socialist. He was Atlee’s\nforeign secretary, and he is reported to have got, umm, cross over something\nat Potsdam and banged the table and water… You know, there were glasses\nof water which, I gather that the Russians didn’t take very kindly to! This man,\nyou know, who was determined to have his way bang the table. The work up\nuntil we got to Berlin was really quite interesting. But once, you know, the\nfinal stamps were being put on, the dividing of the city into regions and things\nlike the break-up of the Navy, of the German Navy, there really wasn’t much\ninteresting to do, and it did become a sort of, almost a playground.\n\n\n\n** Start of Film 9\n\n01:51:58\n\nJust tell me about VJ day?\nWell, we were in Berlin when VJ day was announced and they said there\nwould be a parade towards the Brandenburg gate, so we went, had the day\noff and went down to see and it was a wonderful display, even though it was\nthe end of the war and everybody was a bit tired and fed up. The Americans\nput on a great show with what equipment they had and so did the Russians.\n\n01:52:31\n\nWere you thrilled that it was the end of the war?\nWere we…?\n\n01:52:37\n\nWere you thrilled that the war was over then?\nYes, I suppose we were really. We were all a bit uncertain about what was\ngoing to happen, you know, the war was over and, you know, there was this\ndevastated city – how was it going to recover and, you know, who was going\nto see the Germans behave themselves, you know, with little recognition that\nthe Russians were really the problem, in terms of the future, because that\nwas in Stalin’s day, of course. Yes, it was like going, any group just going out\nto see a parade, you know.\n\n01:53:20\n\nWhen was you demob, and just tell me a bit about that.\nOh, I did go back to Chatham to be demobbed. You know, I said I wanted to\nbe demobbed and of course they were then planning the break-up of all the\nservices, and I went back to Chatham, just to be… hand over things that I…\nequipment I’d got that I had to return. It was a very uneventful thing, my\ndemob! And I returned home.\n\n01:53:54\n\nWhat were the circumstances around your BEM?\nWell, that again, was a bit difficult for me to explain because it was mainly for\nthe work that I did, you know. The thing that came, you know, from… from\nthe palace just said for zeal and devotion to duty. Whatever that means!\nYeah. But of course it was war-time and there was no sort of going to the\npalace to get your gong or anything, you know, it just came in the post!\n\n01:54:31\n\nIt must be nice to have…\nBut it was quite nice to feel that it was recognised. Although it wasn’t madly\ninteresting or madly responsible, you felt you were contributing in some way,\nwhich is what I wanted to do in the beginning! You know, it’s a great thing to\nserve your King and country.\n\n01:54:54\n\nWhat is said\nDoing your bit!\nYes.\n\n01:54:58\n\nAnd how do you reflect on your life as a wren, then?\nI think one of the things, you know, I began to become much more interested\nin being with people rather than paper, as it were, and I had a… I was looking\nround for a job and I just found that there was an approved school wanting a\nsecretary and they called them housemistress, in Bath. I didn’t want to be in\nBristol, I didn’t want to go back to my old job, and that’s how… that was my\nfirst step into social work. And then my father became very ill and as the\nunmarried daughter in the family, I was expected to be at home. And, you\nknow, I was concerned for both of them, because he was a good deal older\nthan mum, so I returned. I gave up the approved school that I was working\nat, which incidentally the last one was a place called Duncroft in Middlesex,\nwhich had been associated with Jimmy Saville! I thought my goodness! And,\nthen I… Oh, I had, before I left Duncroft I had got myself a job with Bristol\nchildren’s department, which was in the days before the social services as\nsuch were formed. And I stayed with them ‘til I retired. Which, golly, do you\nknow that was twenty nine years ago.\n\n01:56:45\n\nDo you still think about the WRNS?\nOh yes! It… Oh the WRNS has remained constant because they have a very\nstrong association and that’s, I gather, how you ran me to Earth. And I’ve\nbelonged to the local branch since 1953, I think it was, I joined.\n\n01:57:08\n\nSo, you’re still as proud to be a WRN now, as you were when you\nbecame one?\nYeah.

The war had broken out by then\nobviously, I wanted to join the WRNS, I went down I thought I’ll hopefully\nget in the WRNS if not I’ll have to go into the WAAF but, they accepted me\ninto the WRNS. At the time they were only taking on cooks and stewards\nwhich of course I did not want to do. I did an eye test and they decided I\nhad perfect eye sight then and I was told I was going to be a Signaller… it\ndidn’t mean much to me but, I didn’t mind what it was and I was called up\njust a month before Christmas to HMS Cabbala which is up in Warrington.\n\n01:01:52\n\nWhat year was that?\n\n\n\nI’m just trying to think… 1941, in the middle of 1941 and I thought this is\nmarvelous all the officers at Christmas were waiting this is a lovely idea but,\nof course that was short lived. It was very tough at Cabbala you were given\ntwo weeks what they call probabtion and you were given all the dirty jobs to\ndo in overalls scrubbing the floors, cleaning the loos it was make or break\ntime really. Squad drill and squad drill… you hated squad drill but, I got to\nlove it after that but, that’s another story. At the end of the fortnight we were\naccepted some of them went home and some of them went AWOL. If you\nwent AWOL then you just went into munitions or what have you but, if you\ndidn’t really like it then perhaps the WAAF would have had you, we were\nfirst choice in those days. Everyone wanted to go in the WRNS. And so I\nstarted my visual signaling and coding, I did some coding as well but,\nbasically visual signaling and the course lasted I think six months… yes it\nwas about six months, no four months I think and after that time you went\non leave and then you were drafted to different places. We all of course\nput down for Plymouth all wanted to come south because I lived then in\nWelwyn Garden City obviously so it was south I wanted. I ended up in Oban\nI never even heard of it I had to find it on the map when I got the draft, I\ndidn’t even know where it was… I found it and I thought ‘this is lovely, it will\nbe lovely up there’.\n\n01:03:37\n\nCan I just go back a bit you sounded like you were emphatic about\nwanting to join the WRNS over any other service why?\nI don’t know I got no naval… all my father and grandfather all served in the\narmy I don’t know what it was I loved the sea maybe the uniform… do you\nknow I don’t really know but, I always wanted to be in the WRNS it was just\nsomething… I think Stephanie had the same when you read her book.\nThere is an attraction to it I suppose in a way it’s a sort of glamour of the\nWRNS.\n\n** Start of Film 2\n\n01:04:16\n\nNow you mentioned Cabbala and you mentioned ship visualization\nand coding but, I’d like to know a bit more about what you were\nlearning and how you learnt visualization and what was the process?\nWell first of all you got to learn the Morse Code even at seventeen that was\na bit tricky but, still you learn the Morse Code and that is absolutely\ndrummed into you the Morse Code.\n\n01:04:44\n\nIs it purely repetition?\n\n\n\nYes really and truly and you learn gimmicks to learn it you know f for face\nyou learn all these gimmicky things to remind you. It is tough we were all\nput into classes and the visual signallers classes all began with a V and my\nclass was verity and I can’t remember what Stephanie’s class is but, she\ndoes mention it in the book. The wireless telegraphers classes all began\nwith a W like Warspite and the coding classes all began with a C and each\ncourse was a different length and we learnt Morse Code, Semaphore to\nsignal with flags you know like the old Nelson signal which kept changing\nlearning the phonetic alphabet which half way through our course changed\nso the Americans could understand it which annoyed us because why\nshould we have to change after all these years. Anyway so the phonetic\nalphabet… every class was manned by an ex serving man usually a chief\nwho’d never dealt with women before and some of them were a bit tough,\na bit tough but, we needed it because we were completely raw to it all and\nwe were taught naval discipline and different time watches you know how\nto read a twenty four hour clock which of course we hadn’t started to use\nthen, the basics… really basics and I found it quite enjoyable it was just like\nbeing at school really.\n\n01:06:21\n\nAnd what about your Wrenery where were you staying what was that\nlike?\nPretty spartan but, not too bad it was old Nissan huts I think they’d been\nused by I think she definitely mentions it in her book I think they had been\nused by the post office they were old Nissan huts on this big site at Newton\n???? just outside Warrington and it’s obviously now been developed into a\nbig housing estate but, it was a very large camp mostly the Wrenery but,\nthere was also men onboard as well they were learning I think WT but, we\nwere obviously being trained to take over some of the signal stations from\nthe men to release them which we learnt afterwards obviously so I got my\ndraft up to Oban.\n\n01:07:13\n\nAnd when you get a draft how is your communication with your\nparents and this draft you say ‘Oban blimey where’s that’ how did you\nget there? What did your parents think?\n\n\n\nWell a bit staggered with my mother and my father my father took me up to\nEuston Station. I got this draft just a thing report to I suppose it was patrol\npolice up at Euston then I was sent to… no I went to Kings Cross and had\nto go to Euston all this military stuff all in civvies you were only allowed to\ntake a suitcase of cloths. One outfit of civvie clothes and then the usual\npajamas always pajamas you know the usual sort of things you were going\ninto hospital I suppose but, only one set of civilian clothes and to report to\nthis place at one of the stations I think it was Kings Cross and they took me\nunder their wing and sorted me out and got me onto the train my father saw\nme off and that was really all that happened I ended up where ever am I\ngoing… you go miles and miles and of course there was quite a few sailors\ngoing up going back of leave and they were all kind to me, they all realised\nwhat was happening and the train was crowded and I can remember we\ncouldn’t sit down anywhere and one of the sailors put me up on top of the\nrack at the top so I could have a sleep. I can always remember that. We\ngot to Carlisle there was an air raid warning and we had to stay in Carlisle\nsiding for about an hour which meant that I had missed my train from\nCarlisle to Sterling where I had to change again so that was another\nproblem.\nGot to Sterling and of course the train to Oban had gone so I was stranded\nthe WVS put me up in a hotel or hostel for the night and I went on to Oban\nreported to Oban to the officer in charge at Oban and was told I was going\nto the pier signal station in the morning I was going to the pier signal station\nand in the meantime of course I’d been kitted it out at Cabbala we were\nkitted up but, I didn’t have any bell bottoms that was essential for a VS Wren\nbecause it was so cold. So I was issued with bell bottoms and the next day\nwent on duty and I thought this is crazy all this sort of business at Cabbala\nand all the strict discipline naval discipline nobody seemed to be bothered\nup in Oban. I don’t even think they realised there was a war on except for\nthe convoys coming in. I liked it, I liked Scotland Stephanie didn’t like it if\nyou’re reading her book or you’ve ever read it she just didn’t seem to mix in\nvery well with Scottish people but, I’ve got a Scottish grandfather so I did\naccept it more and I realise that they’re a bit insula they didn’t mean to be\noff putting but, they were it’s an insular land up in the Highlands. I don’t\nknow whether you know the Highlands very well, they’re a thing unto\nthemselves.\n\n** Start of Film 3\n\n01:10:54\n\nOk well so just describe a bit about Oban… what the base was like,\nwhat your surrounding were like, where you slept and then we’ll talk\nabout the work?\n\n\n\nWell Oban first of all I was stationed in what was called the Station Hotel\nand the signals station on the pier was only a short walk away and I met up\nwith a girl that was going to work with me she had been there about a week\nwe hadn’t yet started getting the convoys in so we were told what was going\nto happen but, the convoys would come in and they’d be in a bay and we\nhad to man it all the time, we weren’t allowed to go on any boats but, that’s\nanother story we had to monitor everything coming in and out we also had\nto look after funny enough the RAF had their Sunderlands and Catalina’s\nup there and they had a call sign which changed every hour and half of\nthem could never ever read it so we used to have to read their code signal\nfor them to send their patrol boat out but, that was unbeknown to our base\nthat never had a clue what was going on, it was a crazy set up really and\nthe submarines on patrol duty used to come in alongside the pier we had to\ngive them their signals when they went out on patrol but, that was mostly\nwhat we were doing at the pier signal station.\nBut, this wasn’t adequate enough and Ganavan signal station which was\nright around the corner from where we were was still manned by the men.\nAnd they also had the new ASDICS centre opening up just below which\nwas radar on ASDIC that was still done by the men and the men was going\nfrom Ganavan and they were going over to Lismore and the WRNS weren’t\nallowed out there because they were completely alone out there. There\nwas no habitation just a few sheep farmers so the WRNS weren’t allowed\nout in Lismore and that’s where the photograph was taken unbeknown to\nanybody. So the Ganavan signal station was going to Oban and we was\ngoing to go there which meant great difficulty because from the Station\nHotel to Ganavan was about two or three miles in the middle of the night\nthat’s no joke. So eventually I was there for about… at pier signal station\nfrom about I would say about a month before Ganavan was opened.\nGanavan signal station was then opened up for the WRNS and we took\nover from the men and we had an intake of more VS WRNS so there was\nnow six of us instead of four and we took over Ganavan from the men, very\nvery spartan when we was at the pier station we were able to have meals\nin the mess, proper meals and when we were on night watch they would do\nus up sandwiches and when we moved from pier signal station to the\nGanavan signal station we were stationed at a place called ????? lodge\nwhich was very tough going.\nThey didn’t like watch keepers because they couldn’t handle us nearly all\nthe wrenery was writers or WT Operators who worked proper watch hours\nthey were nine until five. Not us we had to do watch keeping hours same\nas the Navy so if we were lucky you would get a hot dinner, if you didn’t you\njust got a sardine sandwich so the food was pretty sparse if you read in the\nbook people my friends who read the book say ‘why did you stand it’ but, I\nsaid ‘there was a war on we didn’t know any different we had to do it, it was\nour job’ the men… it was a very very sparse signal station do you want me\nto describe it to you?...\n\n01:15:02\n\nWhat is said\nYes please yeah…\nThe signal station itself was right on top of Ganavan just by Dunollie house\nwhich is the house of the lord and lady MacDougall I think they were called\nyes MacDougall and it was on their land and it had been built as a look out\ncoast I think originally for the coast guards it was very sparse. It was a two\ntier place you had to reach it… but to get to it it was a climb up a cliff almost\na sheer cliff a road went below us and this sheer cliff up which we had to\ncarry the oldest lamp batteries which was very heavy and then we had to\nhave a coal fire… A because we had to be able to burn any confidential\nbooks that we had if any… if we had any kind of invasion we had to put the\nbooks goodness knows how because they were lead line… but, that’s why\nwe had the fire. We had a bunk down below and a signal up top and a\nbalcony all around, we had a big ten inch Aldis lamps an RT set and it was\nreally just go we were pushed into the deep end.\n\n01:16:27\n\nAnd how far could you see from there what was your vista?\nOh we could see where she’d got it right from… we could see right the way\ndown to Mull over to Lismore we had perfect vision of everything that was\ncoming and going.\n\n** Start of Film 4\n\n01:16:41\n\nWhy was that such an important stretch of coast line in terms of the\nconvoys and your role there?\nBecause it was very safe they thought. They could come in and if you had\na look at a map it is a complete bay and Tobermory the escort ships and\nusually about two or three destroyers dropped the convoy off and went up\nto Tobermory then they would go up the Sound of Mull. If you could\nvisualize that coastline Mull almost protects the bay so any ships passing\nhave to go around behind Mull they don’t realise come in… that’s another\nstory about the Duke of York. I think it was a very safe haven they came\nin, they were escorted off from us probably down to Gourock into the Clyde\nfor unloading or they would mass up ready to go out and the ETA of arrival\nor an expected time of dispatch… they were either coming or going.\n\n01:17:51\n\nAnd what was the most ships you think you ever saw there?\nI don’t know the whole harbour would be full I would say thirty more than\nthat yes… thirty most likely and of course you’d have a list and unfortunately\nyou think there might be a straggler but, they never came and that was a\nterrible thing and you wonder what happened to that one. We had quite a\nlot of losses unfortunately not in the bay you know coming and going.\n\n01:18:25\n\nYou’d expect to see a load of ships…\n\n\nYes because we’d have a list sent to us which was a confidential list and an\nexpected time of arrival and you’d give them about two or three hours but,\nthey never came and you just wonder what happened and they were all\nmanned by mostly merchant men so their Morse wasn’t very good but, now\nand again you’d get a ship that had a few United States… when America\ncame in it was better planned you know the liberty ships came and they\nwere better manned and a little bit overpowering really because they were\nso…. Shall I say this over clever. They used to send Morse at the rate of\nknots thinking that we couldn’t answer it and we would send back at the\nsame rate. This is why we didn’t like the Americans very much I’m afraid\nthey tried all sorts of things. They tried to come up to our signal station and\nwe couldn’t have them in, we weren’t allowed to have them in. We had one\nor two problems with people coming up… shall I go on?\n\n01:19:39\n\nYeah…\nOne night I could hear footsteps coming up and a knock on the door and I\nthought this voice I didn’t know who it was it was a man’s voice and we’d\nalready had a Wren murder in Inveraray a VS Wren murdered in Inveraray\non night watch so we were all… we were all taught how to handle a pistol\nwe had to go on the range which was the RAF had a range and we were\ntaken onto the range by an instructor and we were taught to fire a pistol and\nI have very small wrists and I was taught to fire holding my wrist so I could\nfire with my wrist… we also had a rifle up in the signal station it wasn’t\nloaded there was no ammunition in it but, the pistols were but, this rifle\nwasn’t loaded it was just there as a warning. I heard these footsteps and\nthis is perfectly true… I heard these footsteps coming up and I said to my\noppo ‘I don’t like this very much’ so this… kept knocking on the door and in\nthe end I got this rifle and I thought I can’t… I knew it wasn’t loaded and I\nthought what am I going to do so I put it up the other way and as this voice\ncame through the thing I lifted it up and was going to clock him on the head\nwith it and he said ‘it’s alright Joan it’s only me’ and it was one of the\nsignalman from down below stupid… who’d got a date, I had changed\nwatches with a girl… I shouldn’t tell this really. He obviously used to come\nup for a cup of tea at this time and have a cup of tea with her and he thought\nshe was on watch and in the end he could of got himself killed and I would\nhave been quite within my rights because nobody… we’ve got a great big\nprohibited notice on the door and it never ever came to anything and I never\never reported it because it would of got him into terrible trouble but, we were\narmed but, only with a pistol and a rifle with no ammunition because we had\na Wren in Inveraray.\n\n01:21:48\n\nWhat were the circumstances of that?\n\n\n\nI don’t know I’m afraid all that is a need to know you were never ever told\nwhat happened we were just told to be very aware and to take extra\nprecautions and I think Stephanie mentions this in her book as well. We\nnever ever knew what had happened and I mean we had what we thought\nwas a spy that come down and it was all prohibited land for civilians but,\nthis man used to come down and sit on the rocks and wait for the convoys\nand he had binoculars and a camera and we were not allowed to take\nphotographs of the convoys, we could take photographs around our cabin…\naround the thing but, not the convoys... not allowed to so we reported this\nman to our headquarters in signals back in Station Hotel and nothing ever\nhappened about it, he just disappeared we never heard whether he was just\na local newspaper man or whether he was a kind of spy or whether he was\njust interested in ships we never heard. I’m afraid in those days it was all\nneed to know you were never ever told.\n\n** Start of Film 5\n\n01:22:54\n\nAnd just picking up on the Americans you were talking about because\nthe Americans gave you some hassle?\nYes well they would try to bribe us, they wanted to come up the signal\nstation ‘look honey we’ve got some nylons’ or honey we’ve got bananas\nonboard you know this sort of thing… it was so stupid and childish we took\na dislike to them what we didn’t like was the way they used to treat their\nofficers complete disrespect they would call them by their first names which\nwe thought was terrible and the captains and all the officers never seemed\nto take any notice of them and in Oban one day shopping and the\nAmericans who came onboard… came shopping as well and they would\nlike to take us for a cup of coffee and ok fine which they did we took them\nto the YMCA and had a cup of coffee going back some of their officers were\ncoming the other way well we were appalled the way they spoke… no\nsaluting ‘hiya hiya cap’ I thought this is terrible I can’t describe it they were\njust another world away and they were trying to bribe us with bananas and\nnylons and we just didn’t want to know we thought it was so childish with all\nthis very fast flashing Morse.\n\n01:24:18\n\nYou touched on the different methods of communication you had the\nsemaphore, you talked about the lamps there. So just when do you\nused different types of communication or is it one specific type in\nOban in the station?\nAlways by Morse by light or sometime by RT but, nearly always… the RT\nwe only really used for the ASDIC station but, lamps Aldis and all the big\nten inch which was very difficult of course to handle you had to go out on\nthe balcony and of course up there the winds were always at gale force and\nwe always had to hoist the cones for the weather every day… every day we\nhad to hoist the cones for the convoys to know what the weather was.\n\n\n01:25:06\n\nWhat is said\nWhat were the cones?\nThe cones were the cone was a shape like that and you hoisted it up for the\nnorth wind and down for the south wind very primitive but, it gave them\nsome idea where the wind. Another thing you could tell which way the wind\nwas blowing just look at the ensign which we always had to fly, the white\nensign and we had to by the colours… put it up at sunrise and down at\nsunset so the ensign was always flying so you could always tell which way\nthe wind was blowing without the cone and if it was a gale force wind we\nused to put the cone up which sometimes meant the cone was up for days\nbecause the gales would blow up there, very windy. And sometimes we\nwould have to be lashed onto the ten inch by our oppo because it was so\nwindy you kept being blown away it was very very cold and we were always\nwet but, it didn’t seem to matter.\n\n01:26:10\n\nDid you have a bath or a shower up there?\nWhen we went back….\n\n01:26:15\n\nHow long would you be situated up there then?\nWell the night watch was a long one we’d go on something like eight o’clock\nand come off at eight o’clock next morning that was a very long one. The\nother watches was pretty well four hours on four hours off but, in the night\nwatch was a tough one.\n\n01:26:34\n\nYou said you had to walk there and back?\nFirst of all we had to walk we couldn’t… we objected because the men in\nthe ASDIC station down below us got transport they were working the same\nwatches well yes ok… then they decided they would issue us with bicycles\nwhich they did. We had a Wren officer come up to see us and she said this\nisn’t good enough and then they supplied transport for us so we didn’t have\nto walk the night watch backwards and forwards three or four miles in the\npitch dark along a coast road but, first of all we had to before they realised\nwhat was happening.\n\n** Start of Film 6\n\n01:27:14\n\nThere is a story about The Duke of York can you tell me about that?\n\n\n\nThe Duke of York we never had the big ships the escort ships never really\ncame into us just destroyers or corvettes because they always used to go\ninto Mull to wait for the convoys to go back out so we never had anything\nwhat I would call large. I was on watch with Stephanie on this particular\noccasion and if you can picture the islands and the sea and suddenly you\nsee a great big cross mast coming at you and you thing what an earth is\nthat. You had no idea what it could possibly be and we had no ETA for\nanything, we had nothing. It was moving very slowly it got bigger and bigger\nwe couldn’t believe it of course we called it up and there was no reply and\nof course that was worrying because there was no reply because every hour\nit changed the call up sign had changed in the code book so you would call\nthem up by the code what it was for the day and no reply. So we had a little\nship… we had two ships actually one was called the Southern Star and one\nwas called the Southern Wave and they were patrols ships and they used\nto patrol backwards and forwards along the convoys all the time, they were\nold something I would call something like a corvette. I think they were old\ntrawlers they were manned by Navy and they were… if any trouble we\ncalled them up immediately.\nAnd we called up the Southern Star she was way out over Mull and we\nasked her what it was all about and she said ‘I can’t see anything from here’\nbecause they would be way way… she said ‘I’ll go and investigate’ she said\n‘if it’s any trouble I’ll put a shot across it’s bows’ and that was that anyway\nthis thing got bigger and bigger eventually I managed to call up obviously\nthe Bunting Tosser that was visual signallers are called Bunting Tossers.\nWas asleep I should think he thought we’re only coasting around these\nislands and he came back quickly D of Y instead of a pennant number\nbecause all ships have pennant numbers. Either the pennant number of\nthe ship of the code but, she came back quickly with D of Y and I said to\nStephanie ‘D of Y Duck of York’ I said ‘gosh it’s a battleship and base don’t\nknow’ so we quickly phoned our base and they didn’t believe us because\nnobody had got an ETA anyway the captain of our base came rushing\ndown. Took him about half an hour to get to us by which time she was in\nfull view massive great thing it just filled up the whole of the bay I’ve never\nseen anything like it and of course it was a great big who har about this why\ndidn’t we know. Well of course she was on pilgrimage up to Norway after\nthe Scharnhorst and she was doing this I suppose she though they’d got\ntime… I don’t know why they did it they were way of course…. She must\nhave known the way very well because it’s very dangerous out there but,\nshe did she came right passed us just of Mull. I mean I can show you exactly\nwhere she was on a map she just appeared by the islands as if it was on\nsome kind of film it was incredible and the sort of thing you dream about.\n\n01:30:53\n\nLovely story…\nNobody ever really again need to know… we never really found out but, we\nrealised afterwards what it was all about she was on her way up to the battle\nin Norway.\n\n01:31:09\n\nWhat is said\nD-Day?\nD-Day came we had all ships… we couldn’t understand why they looked so\ndreadful they were all sort of battered ships and we thought we’d seen some\nawful sites but, there was about fifty of them with two destroyers The\nDurban and something else one was the Durban and one was something\nelse maybe she mentioned it in the book. Anyway and we thought gosh the\ndestroyer looks in terrible state surely the Navy… we had no idea what they\nwere they came in I suppose they came in a week about ten days enough\ntime for Stephanie to get to know this signalmen yes it must be ten days.\nWe still couldn’t understand why they were in such a state and why they\ndidn’t because they only ever stayed two or three days but, they seemed to\nbe a long time and we thought hello something is going on then all our…\nwe were told we were not allowed to post anymore letters all our letters\nwere to be cancelled… all our postage out was to be cancelled everything\ngoing out from the base was to be stopped and all leave was stopped and\nwe thought something was in the air. You know you get that feeling.\nWe thought well where they are going what are they going to do and of\ncourse they were the block ships. The night before D-Day they didn’t know\nwhat they were doing they had no idea what it was all about or so they said.\nThe night before they all seemed to be getting ready… a big ship came\nalongside some of them and took of a lot of stuff we thought they don’t\nusually unload here it goes to Gourock and Greenock but, they were\nunloading all sorts of stuff and we watched them through the telescope you\nknow chairs and tables and all sorts of things were coming out and we\ncouldn’t understand this. Next day when we came up on watch they were\nall busy ready to go out and we had no expected time of departure at all.\nThey all just seemed to disappear and our two patrol ships had no idea.\nThey said ‘what do we do they’re going’ we couldn’t tell them because it\nwas so secret and that was D-Day that was the block ships going down they\nwere all rotten old ships that nobody wanted… the two destroyers had been\nso battle-scarred that they were almost sinkable so they were the two big\nblock ships and these were sent down to help out and we never ever heard\nuntil the end of the war what it was all about these were obviously then the\nblock ships.\n\n** Start of Film 7\n\n01:34:00\n\nA thing you touched on earlier but, I’d like more clarification on is that\nthe convoys essentially you did talk about this documentation so can\nyou just explain again for me you know how the process…?\n\n\n\nA dispatch rider would arrive from base from Station Hotel which was their\nbase a dispatch rider would arrive with a confidential letter which would\ncontain ETA of the next convoy coming in. so right you’d then get it out put\nit in front of you and put it up and wait for the first one to come in ETA 09:00\nand perhaps they wouldn’t start to come in until 09:30 they’d obviously been\nmarked I think from Ireland they were then sort of marked across get the\nETA of them coming across and that was literally how we got the ETA from\nthe dispatch rider confidential letter would come. I suppose they’re every…\nthe convoys were coming in quite regularly at least once a month coming in\nby the time they’d gone out again. The bay was nearly always choka block\nand then of course you’ve also got the RAF boats going backwards and\nforwards with their Sunderland’s and Catalina’s so it was quite a busy little\nharbour and every single thing had to be logged and logged out, identified\nand put down you know you had to be on watch pretty well aware what was\ngoing on all around you literally in the air with the Catalina’s. this why we\nhad to have Southern Wave and Southern Star who used to be out, they\nwere also signaling and trying to get… it was really like a great big heard of\nsheep and two Shepard’s trying to keep them in it could have been\norganised chaos but, it wasn’t it was very very good. It always worked it\nwas just sheparding these ships you know these big liberty ships, they were\nquite big.\n\n01:36:01\n\nAnd do these liberty ships have its own call sign which you would…?\nYes each… we knew each one we had a identification for each one so we\ncould mark them off if not we’ve got everyone’s name the list wasn’t very\nlong but, yes we had identification for all of them. You had to concentrate\nquite hard when they were coming in you couldn’t let your attention wander\nbecause you know you’ve got to be so quick.\n\n01:36:30\n\nAnd you talked about some of them not coming how do you feel when\nyou’ve done five convoys and you’re missing twenty boats what was\nthe feeling?\nWell first of all when it first happened its’ you wonder what happened to\nthose I hope they’re alright but, by the time you’ve done it for about a year\nor so you just except it you know what do you do you don’t know what has\nhappened to them you never know what’s happened again you’ve got this\nneed to know. We used to try and find out but, we were never ever told that\nthree of them probably been sunk off somewhere you think I wonder how\nfar they got and what happened to the men but, you know what happened\nto all that lovely stuff that was coming in or going out I don’t know. You just\ndon’t know you never knew you just had to accept whatever was happening\njust and leave it put all your sort of personnel feelings aside because it was\nno good worrying about it because what could you do.\n\n01:37:31\n\nAnd what do you remember of VE-Day?\n\n\nVE-Day I was still on watch on VE-Day I don’t remember much about it\nbecause I was up in Scotland we were invited to a big parade in Edinburgh\nwhich we did take part in later on but, the big VE parade we thought by the\ntime we get there… I mean it’s a journey from Oban to Edinburgh I mean\nit’s you just don’t get on your bike and go you’ve got… I don’t remember we\njust had a party that was all we had a party. We were never allowed\nobviously the rum, the rum ration but, sometimes we used to go on… the\nships used to come in and we had a tot of rum but, I hated it I didn’t like it\nvery much. Of course after the war I was in the Royal Naval Association\nand I was Vice Chairman of the ??? branch of the Royal Naval Association\nand they used to have tots up there always offered me, I don’t like it it’s to\nhot and to fiery for me so VE-Day was really just a tot of rum and a knees\nup in the base.\n\n01:38:48\n\nAnd VJ-Day the end of the war totally?\nThe end of the war where was i… at the end of the war I was out Toward\nPoint in Dunoon because as the convoys were no longer needed we were\nno longer needed so Stephanie went to Ireland and I went to Toward Point,\nDunoon to HMS Brontosaurus and that was the ships coming back and forth\ndown the Clyde and that was where I spent VJ-Day and just another knees\nup really you can’t say much more about it and from there I could either stay\nin the WRNS or I could be demobbed from there which I was demobbed\nbecause I wanted to go on a social services course so I already lined up\nwhat I wanted to do. In a way now I regret now not staying in I think in a\nway but, it happened it didn’t work out like that.\n\n01:39:44\n\nAnd how do you reflect on it all now many years later?\nI enjoyed it I quite liked it, I’m glad I did it, it was an experience I’ll never\nhave again and nobody will ever have again because it will never happen\nlike that again, I enjoyed my time up there, I loved the highlands.\n\n01:40:05\n\nEnd of Films\n\n\n", "label": []}

When he married my mother\nwherever he was he tried to get us as children with him. I mean I went to\nschool out in Malta for two year.\n\n01:00:52\n\nSo, what do you remember about the outbreak of war?\nWell, at that period I mean, (Dad finally decided), well as I was saying I was\nin the church choir I was walking through the village one day it was always\nsurnames with the vicar “Pitcher” he said, “There’s a job going down at\nHalesworth as an apprentice hairdresser if you wish” It was a job so I went\ndown and got the job, my job obviously at the start I was taught how to\nshave with the old cutthroat and believe it or not I mean a shave in those\ndays was tuppence and a haircut was four pence. Well, I mean I finally got\nto shaving the head bloke, the head bloke there I was more nervous than\nhe was, yer anyway I succeeded.\n\n01:01:53\n\nOkay, so let’s move on to the war then, what do you remember the\noutbreak of war where were you and did you expect to get into the\nnavy at that point?\nPeople were saying, I mean I was obviously that type of age should be\ncalled up and they’d make you a cup of tea, and well my sons in the army\nor in the navy and I was glad when I finally got my calling up papers.\n\n01:02:19\n\nSo you didn’t volunteer you were called up?\nNo, no I was called up and the railway warrant was for Afon-wen I thought\nsurely not China. So, I looked it up and it was Pwllheli, North Wales. HMS\nGlendower, and so finally had come the day and I had to turn up at HMS\nGlendower.\n\n** Start of Film 2\n\n01:02:48\n\nWhat was it like going to Glendower then?\n\n\n\nWell, there was a train journey, train journey and cause funnily enough I\nmet in with other lads who were being called up the same day so you got\nchatting to them. I mean every week they’d be a crowd of lads come in and\nyou’d see um come in your now you got your uniform your in the navy and\nyou’d see the train come in and other lads come in and all of them you done\nyour seamanship, and then you were allowed a week at home, sorry not a\nweek a weekend at home and then back and do gunnery and get drafted to\na port.\n\n01:03:31\n\nWhich was your port?\nMy first port was, I’ll think of the name of it in a minute, Hull and again you’d\ngo on a pool, report to a certain place. I was amazed stepping out of the\nstation at Hull, the bombing, they were quiet heavily bombed. So you get on\nthis pool and finally I had the ship, a little coaster, a collier “The HMS\nKenrix”. HMS Kenrix, I’ve got a photograph of her here in my bundle. HMS\nKenrix and I mean the, it was a collier and we were taking coal, I mean our\nobject was from Goole to Poole. I mean having got loaded at Goole which is\nlike inland from Hull you went up the Humber a little bit and these trains\ncome along and just tip up and the dust I mean everywhere was saturated\nwith dust, it would slide into the hold and suddenly you’re full up. Anyway\ngoing down the Humber the skipper said to me, our main argument\n(armament- is what should have been said) on a little ship coaster, they’d\nbe three gunners aboard that’s all we had, three gunners\n‘If you like you can try your gun” So, I had a blast away, I tried to just miss a\nbuoy you know. Anyway having done that I see the chief engineer below\ndeck he said “For God’s sake before you fire that gun another time tap on\nthe deck- because it’s unbelievable the noise down there. I didn’t appreciate\nthat and there we were at sea.\n\n\n\nConvoy, you were always in convoy on that east coast because of E-boats\nwere quiet frequent, you know German e-boats. We’d pick up escorts and\nmore escorts from The Wash they’d come out MTB’s come out you know.\nHaving got in the Southend area there’s a boat there, the convoy sort of\nsails past this boat and as you come by there’s a hailer “Where you from\nand where you bound?” So it’s from Goole to Poole and we had another\ngunner lower down honestly on deck from this ship and all he’d bring was\nhis toothbrush and what ever and to get through the channel, to go through\nthe channel at night because they were at times, although we got through\nalright, they were bombing from Dover from Europe to that coast line. I\nmean at one period one convoy we went into there’s a deep sea ships\nwould come all round the coast and join us and suddenly we ran into fog\nand at that period they were on tacking well that means you know suddenly,\nI was off duty but I was on the deck and we’re a little coaster and suddenly I\nsee this whacking great deep sea ship making direct for us and I thought\nI’m too late to ring the bridge they can’t alter course and this is a true story\nand cause your life boats hang over board as you know on a little coaster\nyou’d have a lifeboat hanging each side and they hit the life boat and the\nlife boat and we lost the lifeboat , but we got out of it. We had a few days in\nport there and a new lifeboat fixed.\n\n01:07:54\n\nDid you ever come into contact with any German e-boats?\nNever. Never, it was still the luck of the draw really. But another amusing\nthing I mean the skipper his wife come down by train and I mean in his\ncabin he had a four poster bed with the old brass knobs on the bed job you\nknow on the corners and he said “Gunner,” he said “brass up these knobs\nonce a week and there’s sixpence for you” It’s a laugh now but I mean it\nwas a pint of beer. Yer. Anyway, this one time going north to get to the\nHumber again, why this time the crew were so friendly, and all I remember\nI’m aft on the Oregan and you know keeping watch, looking round and\nsuddenly two sides of the bridge there was a bloke who was on the wheel\nand there was a second mate on the other side and they put their hands up\nand said “Look – no hands”. I mean its ridiculous I know but we was in\nconvoy, yer, things like that you know it’s a friendly old crew you know-very\nfriendly.\n\n01:09:15\n\nWere you ever worried on those convoys, because they were attacked\nquite a lot weren’t they?\nThey were, but never no. There was on the next ship I was on.\n\n** Start of Film 3\n\n01:09:31\n\nHow long were you on the Kenrix?\n\n\n\nWell I mean, you were suddenly allowed leave. A case it’s up to you I mean\nI could have stayed aboard her. But Obviously you like to have a leave, you\nknow when your entitled to leave you apply and you leave the ship and then\ncome back to that port and you pick another ship up. This I did I went home\non leave, come back and I picked up the Cambrian Coast another coast\nboat and she was running from Kirkcaldy, Scotland, to London. It was quite\ngood I mean cause one day at winter time I was in London for the\nChristmas and up in Scotland for the New year. Och aye. Friendly old\ncrowd.\n\n01:10:31\n\nWhat year was that?\nI can’t give you the year – well I mean I was called in 1941 so your talking\nabout ’42 . It’ll be 1942 I can’t give dates\n\n01:10:46\n\nCan I ask which port division were you assigned to? Were you a\nChatham?\nI was a Chatham rating but I never got to Chatham. You were a Chatham\nrating and that was it. Never got to Chatham- no\n\n01:10:59\n\nDid you ever have any issues with other ratings? Port ratings or was it\ndid you have a pride to be a Chatham rating?\nWell, I mean my Dad was a Chatham rating. I mean he finished up as a\nsignalman, a chief petty officer. On one trip, we had to on the way going\nnorth we had to call into Middleborough, so we didn’t go along side we\nanchored cause the actual town was quite inland any way we anchored in\nthe harbour, there was a harbour there. So, to get ashore we had to a little\nliberty boat and I’d never sculled, I don’t know if you’ve ever done any\nsculling in your life, they lowered the little boat in to get the chaps ashore\nand I learnt to scull I didn’t go ashore but I was so happy getting lads\nashore and picking them up again I thought it was wonderful. Again, by this\ntime again 3 gunners, they’d be three gunners on board again. Well, I had a\ncolleague George, he was a Londoner and he had a gold tooth and he was\nquite a lad, he was a barrow boy sort of thing. He spent his spare time\nwriting out 3d a pound pears on a bit of paper type of thing. Quite a lad, so\nGeorge was a shore so anyway suddenly up anchor and we’re away and\nGeorge is not with us so I thought oh! God so I thought, oh! You should\nhave reported it, but I didn’t. If he’s got the sense to come up by train and\npick us up you know no body’s going to know anything about it, if he come\nup by night. Well, ongoing into port, in Kirkcaldy the procedure was the\ngunners helping to take the lifeboats in and as a mate I mean I was the\nbelow deck so “ Come on you bloody gunners come up were getting the life\nboats in” ‘Where’s George?” So, I had to tell the first mate. So I said well I’m\nafraid he’s not here hopefully he’ll come up tonight.\n\n\n\nHe said “Well, we’ll leave it but if he comes in nothing no problem. But, if he\ndon’t I’ve got to inform the skipper he’s missing” I often thought if we’d been\ntorpedoed on the way up and George, I don’t know what he’d of done, I\ndon’t know whether he’d have reported it you know- it could have been one\nof us that had sunk. Anyway George turned up and he’d got with a young\nlass, he’s late whether he stayed with her the night I don’t know but any\nway he came up by train. So, he were saved. Again we’ve now left\nKirkcaldy heading south suddenly they realise no cook and the cook- the\nskipper said to me, cause they’d only be three gunners and I mean we used\nto have the cook would cater and serve us only a little cabin and a half\nwhere we used to eat our meals. I mean he’d look after the skipper and\nmate and the first and second mate and the engineer, the first engineer, the\nsecond engineer, the crew looked after themselves they had the use of the\ncooker, you’d fuel it with coal so you couldn’t control any heat. “Pitcher” he\nsaid,” you’ll cook” So, I had to do the cooking- I was doing fine until we hit\nheavy weather- I was seasick! Any way that was it. I got over it, we survived\n.Yer.\n\n01:15:13\n\nWhat was the galley like on something like that?\nWell, it was just, I mean a cook was a professional cook, he was a good\ncook, well he got his stores, but I don’t know whether he was suppin’ up on\nshore or what. But you’d have thought they’d have checked before all\nhands on board. Nothing though and away we went.\n\n01:15:38\n\nHow did you personally feel leaving a ship when you’d had a nice time\nwith the crew?\nOh! Horrible because you got to make new friends and get used to other\npeople, it is horrible- well you couldn’t imagine that because I mean life at\nsea wasn’t all that happy. Really, you was tense a lot of the time. Yep (is it\nrecording now or not?) yes I mean from that aspect but well as I say there’s\nquite a story here really. I wasn’t the only one on this first trip on a\nSilverstone.\n\n01:16:16\n\nCan I ask what did you think of the Silverstone when you first saw\nher?\nWell, I mean (are we recording?) well my first I done my watch, my quarters\nwere aft, we had a four inch an old four inch gun aft from the last war and I\nsaw a rat- well I’m a country lad you don’t keep rats. I told um, which is\nprobably why they didn’t take to me. I said come on rats; you don’t want\nrats “Oh! That’s Joey we feed him” I said well I don’t feed rats. I went and\ngot a trap off the mate, baited it, caught it and killed it! So that was the end\nof that so whether they took a liking I don’t know.\n\n** Start of Film 4\n\n01:17:08\n\nCan I just ask as well, I mean most of your sea ship, seamanship now\nis being coastal how did you feel going out to…\n\n\nDeep sea? West? Well, it was quite an experience really I mean obviously\nthe old Atlantic is a bit tricky but, well I mean every day you get the old\nSunderland and come and circle the convoy, be flashing of lights and\ncontact and all of that and we’d say they’re away home again, they’d be\nhome at their own base at night. Anyway we finally come in through this\nharbour so, I can’t think of the name of the harbour, anyway Nova Scotia\nthere’s an island there, there was a harbour, finish all guns you can unload\nyour guns and that’s it-so we’d all unloaded ours, back in the mess and\nbrewing up having a cup of tea, well suddenly this lad, who you know it was\nhis first trip to sea I think, he come in with a Marlin gun I think he had, well\nwith a Marlin gun the trigger, I think it was used in aircraft as well, was a\nsort ‘L’ shaped job and then you fired it. Well, we’re all sitting round\nsupping our coffee and he flung it on to the mess table ‘I can’t unload the\nbloody thing “ prittttt- the tracer round the mess honestly the tracers and the\narmour piercing through the ships side we’re all down on the deck. Well, of\ncourse there is that one blast and we’re all down and they stop it the\ntriggers released the mere fact of hitting it on the deck hitting it on the edge\nof the mess table started it.\nSo, it was the luck of the draw you know. Nobody didn’t tell the skipper or\nnothing like that. I mean he’s one of forecast you can’t handle a bloody gun\ndo you? No! That was that and the other thing on the same trip my first trip\non her when I was off duty I walked round the deck I mean your off duty you\ncan do as you wish if you don’t want to sleep I saw this hose and I thought\noh! the weather was warm what about a shower and I saw this stop cock\nand I had a little go and nothing and I suppose I’d switched it off I don’t\nknow any way one of the things , I didn’t know at the time, that was the\nmagazine for all our 4 inch guns- to fire it you push your shell in , ram it\nhome and then you put a cordite in a silk bag in and then a sparky was to\nfire it . Well, they come aboard to see if we’d had any action, which we\nhadn’t and examined it you know “Where’s your ammo, where’s your\nammunition?” “In the locker”…. I’d flooded the locker please don’t say\nanything I did say, “Please sir, I did it”. So, I kept quiet but I mean no\nproblem, took it all ashore, and dried it out. The cordites in silk bags- you\ncan dry it out. It’s one of those things but that was I should have reported it I\nsuppose I didn’t know you see. I mean there should have been a lock on\nthe thing but there wasn’t so I done wrong there.\n\n\n\nAnyway we had a trip ashore we was allowed one trip ashore at Montreal, it\nwas Montreal wasn’t it, well, we had a trip ashore and the lights were all on\nit was lovely, we done shopping for the girls. I mean, well you know we\nwere all lads 20, 21,22, the bloods rising type of thing and well we’d got a\ngirlfriend at home you know could you just put that dress on and what ever\nand put that brassiere on, have a twirl round and we did all this. They fell in\nit was lovely it was great. Anyway that was it and then we went down further\nand picked up wheat from another port and away out to sea again. I mean\nthey tell me the Lawrence freezes up in the winter and we were praying\nthere was going to be a heavy frost, but no we was out back to sea again,\nout to sea again. Anyway finally we come in to North Shields with the cargo,\nthis cargo of wheat I mean we had tanks, which they welded to the top deck\nand that’s where you ride there. Well, I didn’t get on to well with the, I\ncouldn’t somehow, I wasn’t part of it, I don’t know whether its cause I killed\ntheir rat, I don’t know I wasn’t getting on too well with the crew so I thought\nwell I did have a problem with the a wisdom tooth so I thought well I’ll go\nsick and get off. So, that was it and what a do the wisdom tooth.\n\n01:23:10\n\nWhen you say you weren’t getting on very well with your crew, I mean\nhow does that manifest itself on a ship for somebody who doesn’t\nknow what life is like on a ship. How did you feel why did you feel that\nway?\nWell, it’s a funny feeling I mean it’s rather suppose like a marriage that’s\ngone wrong you’d like to get out, rid of it really I wish I could. I did have\nproblems with my wisdom tooth – well I thought I’d use that to get off the\nship but funnily enough having said that that ship was clobbered on the\nnext, what I’m thinking I’ve lead a very, well a fortunate life I suppose I\nsurvived and that ship was sunk and I’ve got all the details here, was sunk\nthe next trip.\n\n** Start of Film 5\n\n01:24:05\n\nWhat was it like to get on to a new ship?\nWell, lovely because everything was brand new, everything was brand new\nso yes so from that aspect.\n\n01:24:14\n\nWhat was your mess like?\nAh, well just an ordinary mess, we slept in bunks it wasn’t hammocks- you\nslept in bunks so you were reasonably comfortable, quite comfortable.\n\n01:24:28\n\nWhere was that sailing then?\nWell, I well remember I mean we actually loaded and we didn’t know\nwhere we were going but we loaded at Leith, come out of the Tyne, yes the\nTyne, to Leith travelling north to load and that was a sort of a general sort of\ncargo and cause it turned out to be the torch effort by Algiers where the\nYanks and the British went into Algiers Casablanca and Iran , So er,\n\n01:25:08\n\nWhat is said\nSo what was your cargo do you know?\nGeneral cargo, I mean they’ll be guns we took guns aboard and general\nNAFFI stores, general cargo.\n\n01:25:20\n\nDid you have any sense that this was a different convoy?\nWell, we just didn’t know. We were not told anything on that score so we\njust accepted it. It wasn’t till we got sort of down nearer the Meddy that we\nknew we was involved somewhere in the Mediterranean. So, I mean that\nfirst trip we got through, got into port, and discharged our cargo and away\nback- we went back to Newport in Wales to another cargo and away we\nwent to sea again and we knew then we were going back to Algiers again.\n\n01:26:11\n\nCan I ask you about Algiers because it was quite a big convoy wasn’t\nit?\nWell, it was. I mean when we finally, when we finally went through the\nstraits of Gib, well initially before we went through the Straits we were\nactually bombed with a high level bomber coming over, it was so high but I\nmean our guns couldn’t touch it but we had on the deck a we had a rescue\nlaunch which we had ex pilots who I don’t know whether they’d lost their\nnerve or what but they were going to crew these rescue craft if any ship\nwas in problems in the Mediterranean, that was the idea. Well, they said\nafter the trip I may even have got a bucket out there with if you wanted a\ndrop of rum- you had a sip which they did. Well, I said well you know well\nthey said we were used to dropping bombs we’re not used to being here\nwhere they are coming down. So, anyway that was that. Anyway we finally\ngot through bigger escorts come out of Gib, we had a destroyer and I think\nwe had a cruiser with us. Oh! you think well we’re safe here now; cause the\nother trip went ok. But, no we weren’t we were torpedoed – we got a hit\nfor’ard and um well immediately – I mean having been hit the hatch covers\nare blown up in the air there are bits of timber which covers the hatch, well\nas one come down one of the long bits of wood it landed on a wire which\nran from the funnel to the bridge, well that sets off the siren, well a long\nblast on the siren is abandon ship. Well, well I mean we weren’t sinking\nalthough we were well listed the skipper immediately left the convoy and\nstarted making for the shore this would be more or less opposite Oran we\nwere sort of a nights trip from Algiers where we were making for. So, panic\naboard, no I mean these lads come up from the engine room with all their\nlittle suitcases trying to clamber, well they couldn’t we were listing well they\nwere trying to get in the lifeboats. Well, the ship wasn’t sinking so we had to\nget rifles out to get um “come on get back down below deck we’re alright\nwe’re safe, we’re going, we’re still under way. So, that was it\n\n01:29:02\n\nWho were these people below?\n\n\n\nThey were mostly Indians, they weren’t English, they weren’t English they –\nI don’t know about the engineer whether he was – he wasn’t coming up – I\ndon’t know what he was doing – he didn’t know how to handle it really, well\nwho did? When your hit you don’t quite know um I mean suddenly there’s a\nlist in as much all as you could see the cargo and guns and everything just\nsliding into the Mediterranean. It’s clear water you could actually see the\nstuff just floating – it cleared that hold out entirely. A Corvette left the\nconvoy and escorted us, cause guns were useless we listed too much we\ncouldn’t use anything but we weren’t attacked on the coast. I was thinking\nI’m wondering whether that coastline would be mines, but anyway we made\nAlgiers. Having got in, being listed we tied up alongside in Algiers and the\narmy was now established ashore and they would come in to discharge the\nship ,you know, handle the derricks and everything and discharge . Well,\nwe got friendly with them, and you know we used to feed them because\nthey’d come aboard we had plenty of food aboard and on this particular\nmorning “Where’s old so and so this morning?” and course he has his\n“Well, he got stopped at the gates on the way out last night and he had\nthirteen pair of pants on” Obviously he saw to flog them on shore I suppose\nI don’t know. I mean we had NAFFI stores, we had all that type of thing, we\nhad everything aboard there. Yer.\n\n01:30:54\n\nWhere exactly were you when the torpedo hit? What was your first\nreaction?\nWell, panic really. I mean what do you do? The noise is deafening,\nimmediately it takes a list. Well, I mean once you start to list the waters\npouring in that hole /hold obviously the cargo is going out so, I mean having\nsaid there’s a list you could still- it’s like walking up a hill- but we were still\nafloat.\n\n01:31:27\n\nYou were very lucky to be……….\nWe were lucky – we were lucky. Well, I mean having got in harbour, I was\ntelling the story there. Well finally having the army lads discharge this cargo\nwe then got in another part of the harbour and um I mean most of us was\nallowed ashore, we went ashore and everything. Well, then we had a\nbombing raid in the harbour and I think, I think the ship that was in there as\nwell, I think that was what they were after HMS Sussex, I’m not sure but I\nthink that’s what it was a cruiser. Anyway, well they missed her and hit us\nand we got hit the same exactly the same and she just broke up in the\nharbour. She just sunk in the harbour and nobody was killed. I mean a lot of\nus was ashore. But, I mean with the commotion we got back and I think the\nskipper told quite a story. I think he was having a shower or something. I\ndon’t know quite what happened there but anyway nobody was killed.\n\n** Start of Film 6\n\n\n01:32:43\n\n01:33:50\n\nWhat is said\nIt’s interesting because you know you’ve had a pretty inoffensive war\nreally until you got to Gibraltar you’ve been torpedoed and you’ve\nbeen bombed. How were you reacting to real war situations now- can\nyou remember?\nWell I think it comes automatic – I think it comes automatic. I mean we’d\nseen other ships sunk. I mean at sea suddenly you’d see a destroyer, I\nmean we were always in convoy you’d see a destroyer put a, I think they\nused to put a black flag up and they’d come through the convoy just\ndropping depth charges and I mean , in fact I well remember one convoy\nthe ship broke down , a lot of old ships, some of the old ships merchant\nships were very old and it broke down and they had to tow it into Gib. But\num the old ship, your ship would think you’d been hit cause there was a\nterrific movement of water a surge of water when they’re dropped yer.\nSo had you seen ships being sunk around you by then?\nWell, again we had that one actually when I was on the Cambrian Coast,\none ship we were picked up in convoy and a ship ahead got sunk, one of\nthe little coasters got sunk and well you heard the bang and suddenly the\nship had gone. So, I mean you just plod on you don’t know the situation.\nThere was usually, they’d be a ship a tug go a stern of the convoy to pick\nup the survivors, so they’d pick up survivors. Yer.\n\n01:34:32\n\nWhat is a gun layers course and why did you go on that?\nWell, it’s a step up from the seaman gunner, which I was, you got, I don’t\nknow what, a little bit of an increase in wages and as I was on coastal\nships I was the other two were seaman gunners you were in charge of the\ngunnery so from that aspect and you got a rise in wages and this was\ndone at Leith and I mean in the end you had to go to sea to fire off, there’s\na little story there , on a little coaster and a biddy and the skipper to pass\nyou out on this course to pass as a gun layer and you had to fire a twelve\npounder gun , different positions on the gun and the procedure if , if the\ngun failed to fire according to the annual you just put it to safety and leave\nit but the bloke in charge of it he just opened the breach took it out and\nsaid “ Gun,” now what was it , he give an order and threw it over board\nand then carried on with his lesson. But, I mean that was not according to\nthe book. But, I mean if that gun couldn’t use it we couldn’t pass because\nwe was at sea – so that’s how it went on. Anyway I passed that. I mean\nanother one I had to go in one of these where the bloke in charge was\nsitting and they got these rockets each side which they fire and as your\nlearning the trade you’d sit beside one bloke one side and the bloke in\ncharge here and he fired these rockets, well the poor bloke do you know\nthere was blood coming down his nose I mean when they go off it’s\nunbelievable. Cause they’re on ships, not on merchant ships they’d be on a\ncruiser or whatever – there’s terrific noise. So, you had to pass that. This\nwas done at somewhere on the south/east coast – Hartlepool area where\nwe went – yer.\n\n01:37:02\n\nWhat is said\nWell the next ship you did was the Malayan Prince… and that was an\nunusual cargo, just tell me about that. Were you in convoy with that\ncargo?\nMalayan Prince, hang on I’ve got to think on that one. Oh! Yes we had a\nvery unusual cargo here, we loaded, this was money, it was printed in\nBritain and we had to take this out to Alexandria in Egypt. So, having got\nout there when it was being discharged we had to have rifles own stand on\nguard quite a bit of money passed hands there I assume.Yer.\n\n01:37:46\n\nYou went through the Suez Canal… What was that like?\nWell, I did remember one thing I told you I had to learn the art of\nhairdressing – I went as an apprentice. Malayan Prince was quite a biggish\nship, it was a twin screw so we were Commodore ship going through the\nMediterranean so we had a Commodore on board so I’m aft in our quarters\nand they sent one of the boys down, down below decks to see me “Will you,\nthey say from the bridge they tell me there’s gunner down there that can cut\nhair – the Commodore wants a hair cut, would you come up and give him\nhair cut?” Well, I mean just by hand clippers, so I mean I did it I well\nremember doing one bloke at sea, just an ordinary rating – well army lad\nwhere we had a Bofors we had an army crew come down for a hair cut\ndown the mess . Well, I give him a haircut but I give him a Mohican haircut,\nif you understand me, he had a tuft which he didn’t know he had down, he\nwent back to his mess and come back “What the hell do you think you’re\ndoing?” I said well it’s only a joke come on I’ll put it right. Well, any way\nwent off and there was the skipper, the commodore we’re up on the boat\ndeck in the Mediterranean it’s a lovely day and there’s me with my hand\nclippers giving the commodore a hair cut, I never spoke about it I’m only the\nlower decks really so um, having done it he said “Well, I haven’t got any\nmoney on me at the moment gunner but see me at Alex , I’ll see you get a\nbit of money for it sort of thing ” So, that was it so we arrive in Alex well I\nknew he’d be going a shore so obviously I’m sort of on deck looking up\nand he I see him sort of go over to the skipper and I don’t know I suppose\nhe give me a couple of bob or something like that he went ashore . Yes,\nthat was the end of him.\n\n01:40:06\n\nWas he nice?\nOh! Quite pleasant , quite pleasant . Yes. Well he was getting a cheap\nhaircut wasn’t he and at sea.\n\n** Start of Film 7\n\n01:40:17\n\nAnd the Talma was an interesting ship, it was a hospital ship?\n\n\n\nWell, she was a very old ship, old ship but. I mean we had all English\ndoctors, nurses aboard so I mean we didn’t have much to do with them\nreally apart from the different ports we went to we had to do sabotage\nwatch. I well remember one place this was at Calcutta you sort of walked\nround the firm had a Indian bloke there to make sure the right chaps were\ncoming aboard and I well remember him turning round one bloke he said\n“Him no good Johnny him sick cock” So, I don’t know whether he’d got\nvenereal disease I don’t know. But then he’d go and make me a cup of tea\nand things like that, so friendly, yes.\n\n01:41:24\n\nDid it; was it a different experience at this point to the war I mean is it\nany more enjoyable period?\nWell, yes I mean the war with Germany is over but at this period I mean the\nJaps, I mean the thing with Singapore that’s where we were bound for.\nWell, I mean there we spent quite a bit of time having got up to Calcutta, by\nthis time the British had re-conquered Rangoon on the Burma side and we\nwere going down the Ganges over to Rangoon with Indian troops, leave\nthem there, coming back, more troops and that’s what we were doing for\nquite a while. Then finally the convoy left Rangoon and cause we had the\nbig boys with us then making for Singapore that was the idea. So, I mean\ngoing down that coast I was friendly with the sparks and he kept me\ninformed he said “Well, we just had a phone call come through, not a phone\nbe a message come through the Yanks have just dropped two atom bombs\nand the Japs have apparently surrendered” So, well that was a good news\nthat I mean to go into Singapore that was we’d be well armed so all we\ndone really was mine sweepers ahead of us and we just sailed into\nSingapore and the being a hospital ship we was tied up, we were tied up\nalongside and cause prisoners of war flocked to the docks and well we\nhad food aboard but obviously nature you’d say you know well obviously\ngive him something . Course they stopped all that, we weren’t allowed\ncause they had to be bought back to life again, you know on a normal diet,\nthey couldn’t eat a sandwich as you put it. They were shocking.\n\n01:43:51\n\nWhat did they look like?\nWell, thin obviously thin. But, they stopped all that.\n\n01:43:57\n\n01:44:08\n\nBut, were you shocked when you saw them?\nWell, they were in a state they were horrible Yes, I expect you’ve seen\nphotographs of them – horrible, yes horrible.\nHow did you, do you remember how you felt when you saw things like\nthat?\nWell, I don’t think, you got used to everything, you accepted it I mean we\nwas quite interested with I don’t know what officer we had there we had a\nship there anchored the other side, I think it was going to take the Japanese\nsurrenders. I’m not sure who it was but again I knew at the time I’ve\nforgotten the years have gone by, many moons have gone by haven’t they.\n\n01:44:51\n\nWhat is said\nCan I ask how do you reflect on the war now?\nWell, well I’m glad to be alive and you know and pleased I survived. I mean\ncause a lot of the lads lost weren’t they – lost a lot of boys – yes. Sorry I’m\nstammering now – it’s emotion - sorry –\n\n01:45:32\n\nGlad to have done your bit then?\nWell, yes yes.\n\n01:45:46\n\nEnd of Films\n\n\n", "label": []}

I’m 89 years old, I was born on the\n7th April 1924. [Sniffs] When in the service I had originally joined to be a\nsignaller, and they found out I was colour blind. So I was automatically\ntransferred to a, the a stewarding branch, which I didn’t want but you had\nno choice you did what you were told. And I got transferred to\nminesweepers. And I was based on the Isle of Sheppey at Queenborough-. Queensland. Queenborough Pier. And we had about 10 minesweepers\nthere. We went out every couple days to sweep any mines that had been\ndropped by … boats in the hope of sinking our supply ships.\n\n01:00:57\n\nWhy did you join the navy?\n\n01:00:59\n\nBecause I wanted to get in the fight, I didn’t want to be left behind. At the\ntime I was what they call, in the reserved occupation. I was an apprentice\nas an electrical engineer. And my Dad didn’t want me to, to join up, he was\nin the last war. And he would’ve preferred me to learn a good, steady trade.\nBut I wanted to go so as soon as I was [pause] 18 I went over from\nMaidstone, where our home was, I came over to Chatham to Pembroke\nBarracks and signed up. I said I was 19 but it didn’t matter because they\njust accepted you. If you could breathe in and out and move your arms you\nwere physically fit. I was told to go home and wait and I’d be contacted. And\nabout a week later the envelope came, report to Chatham Barracks on such\nand such a day. I went right through the war without actually seeing the\nGerman. We had long range fights with them but we never actually saw a\nGerman.\n\n01:02:13\n\nBut John, you wanted to do your bit, but why did you not join the\nArmy or the RAF?\n\n01:02:17\n\nI’m not interested in either, and it’s traditional in my family. My father was in\nthe navy, so was my grandfather and an uncle. My grandfather was on\nBeatty’s flagship, The Lion, at the Battle of Jutland, and he didn’t come on\ndeck for three days, he was in the Engineering branch. But that’s the\nservice I wanted to join so I did.\n\n01:02:41\n\nAnd what do you remember of your training?\n\n\n\n\n01:02:44\n\nIt’s rather confuse when you’re young, you don’t take things in so easily.\nBut from Pembroke House--Pembroke Barracks, we were all marched\ndown to, the a, further down the yard where we got fitted out. And at that\ntime everyone, unless they were an officer, wore the same. Four and a …\nrig, with bell-bottoms, the scarf, and the, and the a, the hat. Sent up to\nSkegness with another bunch to Butlins holiday camp, and that became\nHMS Royal Arthur. And I was to start training as a telegraphist, signaller\nand I been doing Morse code. Started on the Morse code for about a\nfortnight, then somebody said ‘ooh, this lot haven’t had a, a colour test,\nthey’d better have it.’ Most of them passed, but two others and me were all\nstrongly colour blind, so you’re out. If you send the wrong colours when\nyou’re signalling it could be a disaster. So that’s when I was transferred\nonto minesweepers on the Stewarding branch.\n\n01:04:14\n\nWere you disappointed?\n\n01:04:16\n\nYes. Nobody liked being on minesweepers, we all kept putting in for\ntransfer to something more glamorous. Destroyers, submarines, MTB’s,\nMGB’s, but always got turned down. ‘You’re doing an important job, you will\nstay put,’ and that was it.\n\n01:04:35\n\nHow many people on one of these minesweepers? How--what was the\nship--the boat like?\n\n01:04:38\n\nFive officers, and about 12 to 15 crew. That includes the, the engineers, or\nthe Stoker branch as they call it, signalling, and, and those doing the actual\nmine detecting. When we first started and went out minesweeping, it was\nthree days on, one day off. And we had two seamen standing in the bows\nwith rifles. When they saw a mine that was floating by, they’d shoot at it, hit\nthe holes and blow it up. But that was when they started the minesweeping\ncampaign, and they, the Germans when they dropped them, had long\nweights on wires so they just floated below the surface to hit the ship. If one\nof those wires came loose the mime would bob onto the surface, and that’s\none of the things we looked for each time we went out. When the Germans\noccupied France, they course got right on the coastline, and they had big\nguns and the …. and they used to pop away at us every time we came out.\nAnd fortunately, we never got hit. There was one amusing anecdote: our\ncommodore had been a senior captain before the war, and he retired of\ncourse, and he was brought back in and made commodore of the\nminesweeping fleet\n\n\n\n\n01:06:39\n\nHe had his 12 minesweepers, and we used to go out and do the same thing\nevery day. The Germans being very meticulous would come out, we’ll say,\nFriday’s and Tuesday’s, not only the same day but the same time, to lay\ntheir mines and then dash back in. We went out the following morning each\ntime to pick them up, and the skipper got a bit fed up with this, and he told\nthe conference of his captains one day, he said ‘next time we go sweeping,\nrun your trawls out, but don’t drop any wires.’ Which is of course contrary to\nall naval instruction and you could have got a court martial if anything\nhappened. But we went through the German minefield as they’d laid it, and\nwe got away with it. So, the Germans came out again to replace the mines\nthey thought we’d picked up, and they lost four of their own boats on their\nown mines. And I don’t think they thought that was very sporting.\n\n01:07:55\n\nWhen we went out, I was due to report with six other stewards, we reported\nto the first lieutenant. We’re damage control party. If the ship got hit, we had\nto clear the damage away, put out any fires and pull the wounded into the\nwar room where the doctor was waiting to do what he could. But fortunately\nit never happened, but that was my official station.\n\n** Start of Film 2\n\n01:08:24\n\nAnd what about bad weather and storms and stuff? Did you ever\nencounter any dangers?\n\n01:08:27\n\nOh, we had some, yes. But we still went out, you just put on your … and\nthat was it. We had safety lines rigged fore and aft so you hold onto those,\nyou wouldn’t get washed overboard.\n\n01:08:41\n\nWhat was it like watching the planes taking--going over you and stuff?\nDid you see much activity in the air?\n\n01:08:44\n\nWe went--Fortunately we never got attacked from the air. I don’t think the,\nthe Germans thought our little boats were worth wasting a bomb on. They\nwanted them for the capital cities or the airfields.\n\n01:09:01\n\nWere you involved in D-Day at all?\n\n\n\n\n01:09:03\n\nYes. Now, a week before D-Day, the base was shut down like an oyster.\nNobody could go off-duty and no-one was allowed in for security reasons,\nobviously. You couldn’t get any post, you couldn’t make any phone calls\nbecause it was coming up, although officially, we didn’t know that. And for\nabout three months before D-Day, on Admiralty instructions we’d started\nnight-sweeping as an alternative to the day shift, so the Germans would get\nused to the idea of us popping along the coast during the hours of\ndarkness. They wouldn’t think anything of it. So [pause] the early morning of\nD-Day, we went out at midnight, and we were sweeping right up to the line\nwhere the battleships were waiting to bombard the coast. We knew exactly\nwhere they were going to be stationed and we swept that most carefully,\nand then we--as they started coming out of the darkness from two o’clock in\nthe morning and waiting, and we retired behind them. There wasn’t\nanything else for us to do, we got sent back here to the, the Isle of\nSheppey.\n\n01:10:10\n\nWhen the troops went ashore, we were a bit annoyed because we weren’t\ndoing anything, and then about eight or nine days later we got the orders to\npatrol the Dutch coast, on the … and pick up all the mines which the\nGermans had so liberally round all the coast there. So that kept us busy for\nabout three weeks, and we were stationed at a little town called Terneuzen,\na very small port but there was a long jetty so we could moor alongside\nthere. And in the evenings, late afternoon, you got shore leave until you\nwere going off again next morning. And I’ve never forgotten the things we\nsaw when we went ashore. The Germans had got out in a hurry, and their,\ntheir signs were everywhere, on the hotel lounge that had been an Officers’\nMess, and the signs were still up. And they’d blew some of the bridges over\nthe canals as they left, and the Dutch flooded some of the … to stop their\nheavy traffic getting away. And I remember once, we went ashore, and we\nall carried the Navy raincoat draped over your arm, folded in a certain way,\nand the officer watching you very well with your things in the pockets:\ncigarettes, packet of biscuits, a tin of jam or whatever, which were not\nsupposed to be taken off the ship, and we were giving it to the Dutch\ncivilians because they were as starved as hell, and looked very ill. And on\nthis occasion we got ashore, and I, I saw a very thin, haggard looking\nwoman coming up the street, pushing her battered pram, and she got two\nlittle kids in there, about three, or a bit less I suppose, and one blanket\ncover them.\n\n01:12:59\n\nAnd I …. ‘good day,’ and she gave me a smile, she couldn’t speak English\nand I couldn’t speak Dutch, but I took out what I had and I put it in her pram.\nYou should’ve seen the look on her face, she must’ve thought it was\nChristmas come twice because what they didn’t eat they could always trade\nfor something else.\n\n** Start of Film 3\n\n\n\n01:13:30\n\nAfter we got rid of most of the mines off the Dutch coast, we had a week’s\nleave due, well obviously we weren’t coming back here for it, it would be on\nthe Dutch coast. And I and another fellow, we got along to the main road,\nwhich was the Brussels road, leading into, into Belgium. We thumbed lifts\nfrom army lorries which were always going up and down, and we got into\nabout three, three hours, no, a bit less, into Bruges, which was one of the\nmost beautiful cities I’ve seen. It’s got two cathedrals, an opera house and\nthe town hall, round four sides of the main square, and the, one of the\nhotels had been taken over as a … for the troops. Bed and breakfast. So\nwe stayed there, and we enjoyed ourselves. And when we came back we\ngot ordered back to this country, and we were still looking for mines which\nmight have escaped detection, be going up and down, but there wasn’t\nmuch urgency in it anymore. And I did put in an application to sit for leading\nsteward but before that could take place, my discharge papers came\nthrough, and that was in the, early, early 1946\n\n01:15:26\n\nAfter the war?\n\n01:15:27\n\nYeah. But unlike the Army or the Air Force, we got plenty of notice when it\nwas coming. I know people in the Air Force, and they were given three\ndays’ notice and then they were out. But in the Navy we had time, you were\ntold you would be demobbed in 3 months. Well that gives you time to start\nlooking round for a civilian job, or somewhere to live if you’re married with\nkids, so I think we had a better deal.\n\n01:16:05\n\nCan you explain--you, you talk about this minesweeping. Just explain\nwhat you were doing and what happens to these mines.\n\n01:16:09\n\nWell, they looked like yard zips from the main masts, stretched out either\nside about 50 feet. And from these … are very sharp cutting wires, with\nweights on the end. And as you go to the water, the idea is to, your cutting\nwires to catch the mooring wires for a mine, and you cut it and the mine\ncomes to the surface and you dispose of it.\n\n01:16:35\n\nHow many mines would you find on an average day?\n\n01:16:39\n\nOn an average day, [pause] possibly a dozen, possibly only two. It varied.\n\n01:16:44\n\nAnd the disposal would be a shot, would it? Or?\n\n01:16:46\n\nThat’s what it started with, yes. Then the Germans eventually, the acoustic\nmine, which wasn’t … it was just dropped in the Channel, hopefully in the\npath of oncoming ships. And it emitted a magnetic field from batteries that\nwere inside, and every ship as it goes also makes a magnetic field, and\nwhen the two collide, the mine goes up. So we had to have what was called\ndegaussing equipment, a special coil fitted right round the ship, allowing\ncurrents to pass through that anticlockwise, and that nullifies the effect of\nthe electronic field. And you could go over mines and you’d be alright.\n\n\n\n01:17:37\n\nCould you find those mines?\n\n01:17:18\n\nWe found them, yes.\n\n01:17:19\n\nHow?\n\n01:17:20\n\nSometimes the Germans got crass and they dropped some of these mines\nat night from low flying planes. And we got back, I wasn’t there I was at, on\na couple days leave and I went home to Maidstone, but I was told, our\nsquadron came back from patrol, and the last ship in slid into its place on\nthe jetty and promptly blew up, because there was a mine underneath been\ndropped by a plane. And the skipper at this last boat, as a result of being six\nfeet from the jetty, he got his degaussing equipment switched off. [Pause] I\nthink there was two survivors but who they were, I don’t know.\n\n01:18:30\n\nBut how would you find--I can understand how you could find a mine\nthat was floating in the water, you cut it and it floats to the surface,\nhow did you find those magnetic mines? Were they on the bottom, or?\n\n01:18:33\n\nThey’re on the bottom, yes.\n\n01:18:34\n\nHow would you find that?\n\n01:18:36\n\nWell with, like a sonar device, it picks up the radiations from the mine and\nyou can see exactly where it is, and then you can drop a depth charge on it.\nYou set the depth charge for 20 feet or 30, whatever it is, and just pop them\nover to the side on a Y-gun.\n\n** Start of Film 4\n\n01:19:00\n\nIn Holland, when you got to Holland, you talked a little bit about what\nyou saw. Are there any other memories of just the devastation?\n\n01:19:03\n\nWhen the Germans got out in a hurry they took everyone with them, alive or\ndead. And blew a couple of bridges and then retreated towards Belgium.\n\n01:19:14\n\nDid you feel like you were winning the war at that stage?\n\n01:19:15\n\nYes. The great day had come, the invasion had started. And we were\npushing in land from the beaches, we hadn’t been shucked back off again\nand it was starting to, to bite.\n\n01:19:33\n\nWhen you were pulled out of D-Day, did you--were you, were you able\nto hear what was going on on D-Day? [Pause] After the battleships\nhave arrived, you’ve come back to base. Did you--were you around\nlong enough to hear about the guns going off?\n\n\n\n\n01:19:38\n\nThe--When the main broadside started, yes. I think that was quarter to six,\nand eight miles of ships all opened up at the same time. We already got\ninformation from the underground, the resistant workers, where the German\nstrongpoints were all along the cliff tops, heavy gun emplacements, bunkers\nfor troops and so on. And they got continuous plastering, and they hadn’t\nquite finished. It was a two hour bombardment, and half an hour before it\nstopped the boats were going ashore with the troops.\n\n01:20:25\n\nDid you hear it?\n\n01:20:26\n\nWe were on the minesweepers behind them, we heard it alright. It was such\na deafening crescendo of noise, there’s nothing like it.\n\n01:20:42\n\nYou weren’t even near it?\n\n01:20:43\n\nNo…\n\n01:20:50\n\nDo you remember VE Day?\n\n01:20:55\n\nOh, that was again marvellous. I was awaiting demob, and of course we got\nrather more leave once peace was declared, and I got, I think it was a four\nday pass, to go home to Maidstone. And we came up on the train to Victoria\nand the place was just one seething mass of people. Every colour, every\nuniform, everything you could think of, everyone was singing, dancing,\nlaughing with complete strangers because they let their hair down. And in\nfront of Buckingham Palace, you couldn’t got a shoehorn in, there were\nhundreds of thousands stretching back down the Mall, waiting for the King,\nQueen and Winston to come on the balcony. And the roar that went out\nmust’ve gone on for about 10, 15 minutes non-stop.\n\n01:22:09\n\nHow do you reflect on your Navy service now?\n\n01:22:13\n\nI’m glad, I’m glad I went. Means I and thousands of others don’t have to\nread about history, we were making it, we were part of that history, and I\nthink it’s something to be proud of.\n\n01:22:39\n\nAre there any other stories you want to share?\n\n01:22:40\n\nI don’t think there’s any, no. As I say, minesweeping is a very dull\noccupation with occasional short periods of activity. But unlike destroyers or\nbattleships, you, you’re not engaged permanently with the opposite number.\n\n01:23:00\n\nWere there any occasions where you were engaged?\n\n01:23:02\n\nNo. We were never attacked by planes, as I said, and we didn’t see any\nGerman troops. The only contact we had was when their long range guns\non the French coast tried to get us while we were minesweeping. But they,\nthey didn’t.\n\n01:23:24\n\nWhat is said\nEnd of Films\n\n\n", "label": []}

I\nwas in the boiler making trade more than anything else. The boiler rooms\nand engine rooms were the ones that, the ones I was employed in. And, I\nknew more about the ships than some of the sailors knew, because I used\nto know every part of the ship, even down into the shafts room, the room\nof the shaft - which goes through and drives the propeller, and one of my\njobs was to put safety shields over the joints of the shaft going through the\nship. I knew about most of the ships, were all different; the engine and\nboiler rooms more than anything, and the air supplies and things like that.\n\n01:01:21\n\nWhen I was about 15 we sat in exams for artisan apprentices or dockyard\napprentices. And at that time I wanted to go into the navy, but at that time\nthey wouldn’t accept you in the, as an engine room artificer if you had\nglasses, because ships in those days, a lot of steam come from the boilers\nso you never, you couldn’t do it, so I went in as an apprentice in Chatham\ndockyards and served 5 years, that was 1936.\n\n01:01:08\n\nIn those days even when you came out of the dockyard gates children\nwere begging there in bare feet for your sandwiches that you had over,\nand you used to give them to the children who were there waiting for the\ndockyard people to come out, so that they could get these sandwiches. It\ndoesn’t seem possible does it but that’s true, yes.\n\n01:02:35\n\nI had a sister who was seven years older and I had a brother who was 7\nyears younger; and what happened to him, I never knew, I never knew.\nBut my sister; she lived until about 83 I think, something like that; with my\nsister, yes. And, my father, was a chief engineer in art in the navy, he did\nhis 22 years you know. And, my mother died when I was 8, so I never\nreally knew a mother’s love and care from the age of 8, no, so I can’t say\nthat I had a happy childhood as such; not having a mother’s care.\n\n** Start of Film 2\n\n\n\n\n01:03:35\n\nWhat do you remember of your early apprenticeship at Chatham\ndockyard, what were you actually, was there a sense of war? Were\nyou, were you building up to war or was it just a job for you at the\ntime?\n\n01:03:42\n\nWell at 1936 I went into the dockyard as an apprentice, a 5 years\napprenticeship, ‘36, in that time, the war broke out at ‘39, that’s right, and\nso I was serving the apprenticeship actually when the war broke out, yes.\nWhen it was, when I finished, I was then a qualified boiler maker which\nwas a hard job, hard work, so I determined at that time that I wouldn’t stay\nas a boiler maker. So I made progress in the trade and I eventually\nbecame an inspector of trades, in the dockyard, that’s what I retired as; an\ninspector of trades. It’s a, The apprenticeship of a boiler maker was a\nhard job; it’s a heavy, heavy material job. if you can imagine, the boilers\nthey weren’t modern, they were what we used to call the arrow boilers,\ncylindrical boilers; made of metal an inch thick and we used to roll it into\nshape. Imagine they were big, they were up to thirty ton, the cranes used\nto have to lift that, yes. It was heavy, hard work, boiler making was, yes I\nknow of a number of people that were killed, when; one of them, he had a\nplate dropped from a crane, it slipped out of the grip, fell on him and killed\nhim, yes, it were terrible. And I remember a man, being killed, on, the\ncranes used to go up and down on rails lifting the heavy, well, lifting thirty\nodd tons, and one man was crushed up in the night, and it was a naval\nofficer who actually went up there, up the steps, as you can imagine the\nsteps were locked so that no, that other people couldn’t get up, but He\nwent up there to retrieve the body or to see if he could do anything more\nfor the body. A very brave man; a naval officer lieutenant he was, as plain\nas if it were yesterday, yes, yes, yes, and, it was hard.\n\n** Start of Film 3\n\n01:06:26\n\nDid you notice, did you notice; to talk a bit about this escalation in\nthe amount of work in terms of providing for the war effort?\n\n01:06:29\n\nWell there were a number of vessels that used to come in damaged\nbecause of the war, and they would be repaired in Chatham dockyard,\nand, and they, we used to do, make, gun shields and torpedo platforms\nthat revolved for the torpedoes on, and we used to do those and make\nthose platforms for torpedoes to be fired from and things like that. And\ngun shields we used to make, made of bulletproof metal which was very\nhard to work with, you know bit hard.\n\n01:07:28\n\nAny other ... came in?\n\n\n\n\n01:07:29\n\nYeah, the Arethusa was a cruise I worked on and the... was another\ncruiser, and, a number of riggers and mine sweepers, and then, when we\nused to do the re-fits; and that would mean stripping out the boiler engine\nrooms and renewing a lot of the stuff - the air supply through the\nventilations down to the engine and boiler rooms, through turbo\ngenerators collecting the air and distributing it around the ship, yes, that\nwas called aluminum trunking with grills on the end of the trunking. And\nyou could alter the different positions through the engines in the boiler\nrooms, yes, I used to make those grills and fit them, and things like that.\n\n01:08:43\n\nI remember the Germans coming over, was quite a number of them, I\nremember the, and the Arethusa, the cruiser opened fire on them, and I\nthink, I think a lot of the craft were Italians on there that had came over;\nbecause it was noticeable that the Germans would have gone on but\nwhen the Arethusa opened fire on them a lot of these planes changed and\nturned round and went back from where they come from, you’d never\nbelieved would you, but that’s what happened! Yes, the Germans would\nhave kept on and would have attacked their target, but I think that some of\nthe others were Italians on there. Yes because where I should have been\ndown under the shelter I stood up against one of the workshop walls, and\nthat was my shelter and watched the Arethusa open up, as she was in\ndock, and she opened up and I was stood there with my back to the wall in\nthe workshop and I saw these men on the Arethusa; stripped to the waist,\nfiring the ships and getting the shells, empty shells and throwing them\naside and loading again and firing. That was on the Arethusa, yes, they\nwere really good, they were, they really, really turned those planes\naround; an experience. Course, I ought to been down in the shelter but I\ndidn’t go down there. Yes, I was given one to go to, it was just a, well it\nwas a dugout, and you went down steps, and, that was there, but I\nwouldn’t go down there; I stood with my back to the wall in the workshop,\nyes. Not that I was brave at all, it’s just that I wouldn’t go down the\nshelters. I’d rather take a chance.\n\n01:11:03\n\n\n** Start of Film 4????\nIn the war, when you weren’t in the dockyard, or were you living in\nthe dockyard as well?\nNo I lived, I lived outside of the dockyard, yes, I lived in Gillingham road\nfor a time, near the railway crossing, you know that part of Gillingham, and\nI lived with my father there, yes cos’, because my mother died when I was\n8, but I went and lived with my dad.\n\n\n\nI think we knew that we’d, put it like this, that we’d win in the end, that we\nwould be the victors as a nation; because I think that the effort, everybody\nwas behind the war effort as far as I know, yes, yes. I suppose it was, you\nweren’t paid a lot of money, you, some people made a lot of money\nbecause of the war, but we were never like that, we never made a lot of\nmoney because of the war being on, and, it was hard work; these great\nbig slabs, I used to do things on, with a vice, a heavy vice one end of it.\nAnd I used to roll plates and cylinders out of inch thick material, and I used\nto work in the furnace and pull rings out of the furnace and round ‘em up,\nand you used to have to have an asbestos sheet to shield yourself from\nthe heat that came off when you pulled it out with rakes onto a slab out\nfrom the furnace.\nAnd the heat was so great that you used to hold these asbestos sheets up\nin front of you to protect yourself from the heat as you endeavoured with\nhammers, large, large hammers, to shape, to, to make them into the right\nshape. Sometimes they weren’t quite round and so you had to put dogs\non them and shape them. You just had asbestos sheets to protect\nyourself from the heat. And the thing was that you was, you made things\nout of asbestos sheets, and you just saw it up, and all the dust, well you\njust breathed it all in; no wonder so many men died of asbestos. It’s a, I\nhad, what they call, plague, in both lungs, which I’ve got now, but it never,\nit never solidified. Men used to breathe it and it would go solid in the\nlungs; but I was fortunate in that mine didn’t solidify, so it hasn’t affected\nme, the breathing, even up to, well now of course it does. I was fortunate,\nbecause many, many of my colleagues died at an early age because of\nasbestos, yes, I remember them; they were compensated a penny for it,\nand. I’ve never asked for compensation, and I’ve never, I’ve never worried\nabout it, because I thought, well I have been breathing all these years, and\nwith no affect, so I’m fortunate.\nAnd with regard to convoys and stuff what did you know about the\nwork that you were doing about keeping convoys going?\n\n\n\nNot a lot really; no we didn’t know a lot. We didn’t get a lot of information\nexcept what we read in the papers, you know. We just did our daily work,\nyou know, cos’ I had to, we had to join the home guard, so very often it\nwas a matter of coming home from work and going out to the home guard,\nyes, which was on beety avenue where we had a place, it was beety\navenue! Where we used to sleep at night, then we’d be called out, they\ncalled it the z batteries and they were rockets and you loaded the rockets\nand fired at night, you know, and there were, there was two projectors and\nyou had to load them onto a projector, which had two, and you was given\nthe elevation and that over the phone, and you did that and then they\nwould give you the word fire and you’d pull the lever and these two rockets\nwent up from each side, and there was about, there was about; must have\nbeen 50 of these z battery rockets on one field, on beety avenue if I\nremember. And you was firing at the aircraft and you’d hear them but you\ncould never see them cos’ it was at night mostly. And during the day, the\nbatteries were made by regular soldiers, you know, and the home guard\nwould do it in the evening, yes,\nHear any?\nI never heard of any, no, to tell you the truth I never heard them, we’d\nactually made a hit, it was, yes, so there was two people on each one, and\nyou’d get the, the rocket was in bunks, a number of them, and you would\ndraw one out, ooh they were heavy; yes that big, yes, they were heavy\ntoo, and I think they were t and t, and they were heavy, and you’d run and\npick one up and load it onto the rocket, and there’d be two, the rocket,\nand you would hear over the phone what elevation you had to set the\nrocket to, or the shell to, or rocket, whatever you like to call it, you’d do\nthat and then you’d hear the elevation and that over the phone and then\nthey’d say fire, and you’d press down and these two went up. There was\na number of them on the field; there must have been, well it’s a job to say\nnow after all this time, but quite a number. And the town’s people used to\nsay they made a terrific noise when they went off, you know, when they\nwere all fired at the same time, and, not a lot, not a lot, there must have\nbeen great celebrations, yes, I can’t remember a lot about it, to tell the\ntruth.\nOh cos’ we had home guard uniforms, and we were allowed to keep that,\nand I used to wear the trousers to work, for ages and ages i wore those\nhome guard trousers. Dirty job boiler making was, yes.\nCan i ask you a question about Pembroke house, can I ask you about\nPembroke house?\nYes…\nHow do you find living here?\n\n\nIn Pembroke house? One of the best places you could be, really, yes, its\nuh, yes, I didn’t really imagine that I would be here, but it’s the best, the\nbest that you can, I think, well its the, uh caring I think is the thing, yes,\nPembroke house, and I remember it of course when it was a girls; it was a\nnaval children, girls, it was a girls home, Pembroke house was when I was\na boy. And I remember the girls being in their little sailors uniform, it was,\nyes it was true, that’s what Pembroke house was, it was for children, girls,\nmostly girls, who’s fathers had been killed or some reason or other, you\nknow that’s what they were, the girls, yeah Pembroke house was a girls,\nyes a girls home, ex naval people’s children, yes. The people, you mean\nthe carers? Very good very good, couldn’t wish for a better place really,\nno, no, very good. They umm, yes, I couldn’t be in a better place, I feel, at\nthe end of my life; because they are caring and err I couldn’t be in a better\nplace now, yes. And my daughters, my daughter, my son are glad that I’m\nhere because they know that I’m being taken care of, yes. My daughter is\nable to come very, very frequently because she lives not far from here,\nyes right opposite, it’s the park isn’t it?, Jennifer park. I, I have walked to\nmy daughter’s, mind you they got onto me because I, I went out of the\nbuilding, and I went along, into the park, and through the park out the\nother gate and along Seeton road and up Cleve road to my son in law, my\ndaughter’s house; 64 Cleve road, I think it’s 64, and they nearly had a fit\nwhen they come to the door and I was there, so, anyhow they got me\nback, no they phoned up first and told, told them here that I was there and\nthat they were going to bring me back, yes.\nEnd of Films\n\n\n", "label": []}

I was four years in the WRNS and I was a chief petty officer after the first\nsix months or so.\n\n01:00:13\n\nOkay, so just, Pam, before we get too much into your service information, just tell me a bit about\nwhere you're from. What was life like for you pre-war?\n\n01:00:22\n\nWell, I was born in Southampton, into a family which was very sea-orientated, coming from a long\nline of sailors and fishermen. My father was a pilot and there wasn't any question as to which service\nI would go in to. When I reached eighteen and the family let me join up, I joined the WRNS.\n\n01:00:50\n\nWhat do you remember of the outbreak of the war and what do you remember of the impact of\nwar on your family?\n\n01:00:55\n\nOh. Well, the greatest impact was a German parachute dropped a mine which landed on the house\nbehind us and killed the family outright. All four of them. Our house, which was a biggish, Victorian,\nsolid-built and there were two other solid-built houses of Victorian style beside us, and round the\nback there was a small series of modern houses, and it landed on one of the modern houses. The\nothers were very badly damaged, ours was badly damaged and the other two were, but by the end\nof the month, ours was the only house standing. It had quite an impact on us. We couldn't live there\nuntil the end of the war. They repaired our house, but all the others had to be rebuilt.\n\n01:01:50\n\nWhat year was that then? Was that '39?\n\n01:01:52\n\n1940.\n\n01:01:53\n\n'40. When did you sign up? How old were you?\n\n01:01:56\n\nI was eighteen when I signed up in 1942. I went to the initial training in Mill Hill for Christmas. I was\nover Christmas there which was odd. It was a bit like a sort of warped boarding school, so it wasn't\ntoo strange, but of course I didn't have to scrub floors in boarding school and you do awful jobs when\nyou're in initial training.\n\n01:02:27\n\nHad you been to boarding school or anything? How did you adapt to it?\n\n01:02:31\n\nYes. Yes, yes.\n\n01:02:32\n\nOh, so you were able to adapt to that sort of ...\n\n01:02:33\n\nIt was easier; I'm sure, for me. Some girls who'd never been away from home were not happy and\nsome of them went home after a fortnight. Not many. Just one or two who were used to being in the\nfamily all the time.\n\n00:02:46\n\nWhen did you sort of have an, at Mill Hill ... Just talk through the procedure for weeding out the\nones that might have gone off to do wire service etc. and how did that all come about?\n\n\n\n01:03:02\n\nWell, I think they start on that beforehand because my mother had to take me out to the admiralty\nto have a test in my German to see if it was good enough. I was just about good enough. Most people\nhad more qualifications than I did or more knowledge because they'd lived in Switzerland or Germany\nitself. That was already organized because whereas most girls were issued with a uniform\nstraightaway, we were not issued until we'd been through a, as far as I remember, through a course\nthat the special unit, in Wimbledon at Southfields, which trained us in the use of radios and what\ncodes the Germans we were listening to would be using. At the end of that, we went to get our\nuniform because we became petty officers straightaway, so it was a different uniform.\n\n01:03:59\n\nDid you go straight from Mill Hill to Southfields or home first?\n\n01:04:02\n\nYes. No, straight to Southfields, yes.\n\n01:04:05\n\nOkay. Can you just talk a bit about what you remember of Southfields and where you were billeted\nand ...\n\n01:04:11\n\nYes. Southfields was a nice house in Wimbledon and there was a lieutenant commander in charge\nwho'd started in the Navy, I suppose about two years before, I don't know when he joined up. He had\nthe idea of having a whole series of stations round the south and east coasts to listen out for German\nE-boats because they were attacking in little packs like the wolf packs of the U-boats on the North\nSea coast area and the channel when our ships went through. They put a whole series of small\nstations, mind you, some of them were twelve WRNS, one Wren officer, in the middle of nowhere,\ntwenty miles from the nearest naval base and nobody knew we were there or what we were doing.\nIt was a pretty deadliest times as regards your time off, but the job itself was very interesting.\n\n01:05:16\n\nYou've explained the purpose of Southfields.\n\n01:05:18\n\nYes.\n\n01:05:19\n\nJust explain the environment of Southfields, and where you were, and how your training was, and\nhow many people were there and ...\n\n\n\nWe weren't big classes, I should think, there were only about a dozen girls at once if that.\nWe had to learn how to use these radios and we had to use radios that worked on very\nhigh frequencies because that was the frequency that the E-boats used. The E-boats were\nMTBs but bigger than ours, at the beginning of the war anyway. Better armored and\nfaster. Ours were at a disadvantage and because they worked in packs, and they would\nsort of assemble in a small bay or cove, and it was difficult for radar to pick them up\nagainst the background and so on. Therefore it was very vital if we could get a DF fix,\nthat's a bearing from two points to fix the position by radio, it helped our men to know\nwhere to take the MTBs.\n\n01:05:26\n\nThey were sent out if we heard ... We had to search all the time because the\nGermans knew we were listening by the time I joined. Therefore, they used a band of 20\nMHz, but they could come up anywhere in the band so you couldn't rely on the frequency.\nYou had to search the whole time. We were therefore called the twiddlers because of\ncourse, you had round knobs then, and you tuned along. Any strange signal you met you\ntried to identify, and if you couldn't you described it because it might be a new device\nthey were using and our people would be able to work out possibly what it was.\nYou'd get all sorts of strange signals and of course, sometimes you were on duty\nand you never heard any Germans at all. Of the type that you were looking for anyway,\nbut occasionally you did. Even if it was very faint, you could sometimes get a bearing on\na faint signal.\n\n01:07:55\n\nHow did you know what the bearing was? You can hear the signal but ...\n\n01:07:59\n\nAh, ah yes. We had, in addition to the watch room where we did this continuous 24 hour search, we\nhad a DF ... What were they called, a DF tower because it's a bit like a small windmill to look at, except\nthat you don't have wheels you have a dipole area coming out of the middle of it which can be\ncontrolled from down below. You twist this big circular control which turns the dipole area and when\nit's in line with the signal, which you will have been told about by the watch room and you're in the\nDF tower, then you have to read off the reading on the band on the control. Well, it's a big sort of\ncircular metal bar, I suppose, and let the watch room know. Then they phone it straight through to\nthe naval intelligence center and if it was ... Then presumably they would pass it on to the flotilla that\nwould have to go out and deal with them, or possibly it was already out. I don't know.\n\n** Start of Film 2\n\n01:09:25\n\nWhen you were in the south though, just to go back to Southfields, where were you billeted?\n\n\n\nAh, yes. We were billeted probably a couple of roads away at a place called something\nlike Rose, Rosedean, or Rose something or other. I can't remember. A private house which\nhad been taken over for the Wrens, because mostly we were in good accommodation. We\nused to walk from there to Southfields proper for our classes, or our instruction, and that\nwent on. Periodically you had to go back for refresher courses from your station. You'd\ngo there for a week or a fortnight for a refresher in new things and all of a sudden, instead\nof being able to walk in a nice casual, relaxed way, they said you've got to march in a\nsquad.\n\n01:09:31\n\n01:11:13\n\nOf course, we weren't very good at that because there was rarely enough people\noff duty at any one time to form a squad anyway. It's quite difficult to do a squad drill\nwhen there's only about five of you in the squad because there's always a gap somewhere.\nWe didn't often have five off anywhere at one time, so we rebelled, and we marched and\nsang the Horst-Wessel-Lied. Do you know it? It's a marvelous German ... It was the\nSturmtruppen song and it had a wonderful beat for marching. Of course, nobody knew,\nwe couldn't make much effect because it was a residential area with not many people\naround but we enjoyed getting our own back. There was no repercussions because they\ndidn't hear us.\n\nHow big is Southfields then? How many rooms is it? What is it?\n\n\n\nWouldn't know, I wouldn't know. You only went to your room for your class. Yes, that\nreminds me. I had my twenty-first birthday there and they had a dance that night, so\nthere was a bit of a party on my birthday. Yeah, that was strange. Southfields itself, you'd\nhave earphones on and you'd take down whatever they said and the Germans used a very\nsimple kind of code because they were so fast. They did about 50 knots or something. I\nmight be wrong but they were faster than ours and because of that they use a kind of\ncode based on the phonetic alphabet. So you'd have Anton, [German 00:12:08], Caesar\nand so on. They'd put two of the letters together and make something up as a code for it\nand it was very simple. The only one I can remember is Sophie, Tony for the first letters\nof stopfen, which meant stop engines or stop. That was for the engine.\n\n01:11:16\n\nThat was the basis of the code and it was very simple to take down because you\njust wrote down the initial letters of the word or the letters they ... We knew a lot of them.\nWe didn't know all of them but we knew a great deal of them or what they meant. This\nwe copied down on a message pad which had a carbon copy below it which was kept in\nthe station. The other one was sent to, I think was sent to Bletchley. Only we didn't know\nit at Bletchley, it was Station X, which to an eighteen year old was a very glamorous place\nto be involved with. There was always somebody else on duty besides you, especially\nduring the daytime, who would take the top sheet of your message pad, immediately push\nthe other pad over so you could carry on without pause and they would phone that through\nto the local naval intelligence center. Which for example, in Portsmouth area, was under\nFort Suffolk. In the Dover area was under Dover Castle.\nI don't know if you've ever been there, but it's fascinating because it's a series of\n... It's like a rabbit warren of tunnels that were built originally, some of them, by French\nprisoners of war back in some other war. It's been expanded since then and I was lent\nfrom Abbot's Cliff near Dover to them for either a week or a fortnight because they were\nshort of people in the intelligence center. I saw the other Wren a bit because the messages\nwould come through to us on the phone from the station, the operating station receiving\nthe messages, then we would teleprint it to Station X. We didn't know where Station X\nwas. We had no knowledge and you never knew anything more than you needed to know\nfor your job. We never knew whether the information we gave to the Navy by this course\nwas ever useful or not, which was sad really, but we hoped it was useful because they\ncertainly needed the help at the beginning of the war.\n\n01:15:14\n\nAfter Southfields, how do you know you've passed? What do they do? Do you have to sign the\nOfficial Secrets Act?\n\n01:15:18\n\nOh, you certainly have to sign the Official Secrets Act, yes. We were not released from it for at least\nthirty years. I was abroad then, and I didn't even know I could tell my family, and both parents died\nbefore I could ever really tell them what I had been doing. I was speaking to a lady yesterday at the\nVJ Memorial Service in Bournemouth, and she said the same. Her parents both died and she'd never\nbeen able to tell them, and what horrifies me nowadays is that people don't seem to care whether\nthey've signed it or not. If they can get money for their story, they will tell it, and yet there must have\nbeen tens of thousands of people who were involved in secret work and we fooled the Germans time\nand time again. It was wonderful, the integrity that people had then.\n\n01:16:18\n\nYou passed out at Southfields, I assume. Yeah, because you got your uniform.\n\n01:16:23\n\nYes.\n\n01:16:24\n\nWhere did you go? You went to?\n\n\n\n01:16:26\n\nAbbot's Cliff.\n\n01:16:26\n\nAbbot's Cliff. What do you remember of Abbot's Cliff?\n\n01:16:28\n\nWell, you're four hundred feet up on a very windy cliff, I remember that. All the windows were\ncovered with camouflage netting obviously, because we were right on the edge of the cliff and a\nprime target in a way. If you tried to go sleep after night watch, there'd be this beastly thing waving\nto and fro in the wind and flapping against ... So it was very difficult to sleep sometimes, or get to\nsleep. Once you'd got to sleep it wasn't too bad.\n\n01:17:04\n\nHow many Wrens there?\n\n01:17:07\n\nThere were more there because that was one of the bigger ... There were two bigger\nstations and that was one of them. They were bigger because they listened to other things\nas well as to the E-boats. In the watch room there, there were two sets. One very high\nfrequency which the E-boats used and a high frequency which was used by more normal\ntraffic. It was more routine German exchanges of messages between the, for example ...\nI remember it better when I was at Ventnor, which was the other big station. We listened\nto the headquarters, the Headquarters of the Germans set up there. They would call every\nso many hours, just about two or three hours, they would keep checking all the harbor\ndefense vessels to see that they were in order, and where they should be, and reception\nwas good and so on. Then they'd pass other minor messages. Nothing very exciting.\nIt was amusing at Christmas because they'd exchange Christmas greetings and\nthings in plain language, but mostly it was the Q Code there. It was routine, but why we\nlistened to it was because if there was any changes in the routine or different messages\nbeing sent then Station X was interested because it meant something was happening.\nLike the Bismarck going through or so on, which I think it was the Bismarck was one of\nthe ones ... Two of the big battleships managed to get down the channel without our\nknowing. How they did it I don't quite know, but they did, but usually it indicated enough\nfor the Navy to sort of have a look out and see what was happening. Otherwise that was\nroutine. That was all in WT and the other was in RT. WT being Morse, of course.\n\n** Start of Film 3\n\n01:19:22\n\nWhat was it like living there?\n\n01:19:24\n\nIt was all right. We were only three miles really, from Dover and about three miles from Folkestone.\nYou could, in time off, go to the pictures in either town or you could go and ... We didn't do much\nshopping those days. We didn't have much money. I think as a petty officer, I got thirty shillings a\nfortnight. Which is one-fifty I think now, but you didn't need much because you had your\naccommodation. Your clothing was very, very cheap which you bought from the purser's store, which\nwe called the parser's store. Things like a shirt would be one and nine pence which is about sort of\ntwenty-five p or something. It's amazing the difference in prices.\n\n01:20:18\n\nDo you remember a lot of people around Dover and Folkestone, or was it basically military?\n\n\n\n01:20:22\n\nWhat is Said\nOh, all of normal people were there. I had an aunt and a cousin who lived in Dover. All\nthe normal people were there and they just endured the constant, you know, they had a\nlot of shelling there. There were Wrens also stationed in Dover itself because that's where\nI had to stay when I was temporarily transferred to the intelligence center there under\nDover Castle. A funny thing happened during my stay there. You were permitted, if\nnothing was happening in the night, there was no traffic as we used to call it, in other\nwords the Germans were no on operations that night; one of you could sleep while the\nother stayed awake then you changed halfway through the night. You slept on the floor\nin a duffle coat; there was nothing else to do.\nIt was my turn to be on the floor. I was fast asleep when I suddenly realised\nsomebody was near me. I opened my eyes and there was a naval officer standing beside\nme, with gold braid all around here and gold braid up to his elbow. I thought oh my\ngoodness, it's the admiral, what do I lie at attention or do I hop up? While I was looking,\nI should think, horrified he just quietly went away and left us. I don't know which admiral\nit was, but a very nice admiral it was obviously.\n\n01:22:04\n\nDid you meet any of the senior admirals? Do you remember any ... Did you see Churchill when you\nwere in Dover?\nNope, no. He wasn't there at that time. I was only there a week or a fortnight, you see.\nNo, nobody of interest came to see us at all and we had very little to do with the Navy. It\nwas one of the things we regretted, obviously. We used to spend our spare time going for\nwalks. If you walked over the dams far enough you could get cream tea even in the war,\nbecause they were so isolated that, you know, they were happy to sell you a cream tea.\nYou could do that also from Ventnor. You had to walk again, over the sort of dam land;\ninland to a little village that's still ... I can't think of the name of it. It's very well known\nfor tourists now, and you could get a cream tea there and that was very nice. Then we'd\nget the bus back, but our entertainment was very limited.\n\n01:22:08\n\nI can only remember going to one party from Abbot's Cliff, and it was an RAF mess\nin somewhere near Highs in Kent. They'd taken over Siegfried Sassoon's house, and the\nthing I most remember of it was a couple who mistook a slightly green slime there was\non the little pond there, and walked straight into the pond. Possibly encouraged by a\ncertain amount of alcohol. That was the highlight of that do. I can't remember much about\nit apart from just working, and walking, and doing things like that. It was never a socially\ngood job because we were in such remote positions usually.\nAfter Abbot's Cliff, I was transferred to Hemsby on the east coast. It was twelve\nWrens, one Wren officer, a lot of sand dunes, a very cold sea and I liked swimming but I\nonly went in once, a very cold North Sea wind, and no village. Nothing except sand dunes.\nIf you had any time off you tried to hitch a lift somewhere, to Norwich. I remember us\ngoing for entertainment. It must have been we had a Saturday off, and you could either\ntry and get to Norwich because there was an American PX there and you could actually\nhave a dance or another night we cycled on awful station bicycles, belonging to the\nwireless station, but crotchety old things.\n\n01:25:06\n\nWere they provided by Nuffield?\n\n\n\n\n01:25:08\n\nQuite possibly because he did provide things for the Wrens, yes. We cycled nine miles into Great\nYarmouth, which isn't very great even when you get there. We went to this hop, which they don't call\nit hop now, but it just means a very ordinary dance with a lot of rude soldiery there, so to speak. We\ncycled back and halfway back, the chain fell off my bicycle and this is about 10:00 at night along a\ncountry road. Luckily two very gallant sailors caught up with us and put my chain back on and said,\nnow don't stop pedaling until you get back, and we managed to get back. We weren't late but I\nsuppose we would've had a good excuse.\n\n01:26:05\n\nWhat sort of operational were you running from Hemsby?\nWell, it was the single operation there. Just the radio telephony, looking out for E-boats.\nIt was just that. You didn't have the other thing which I wasn't qualified to do at that\ntime. I hadn't been on the Morse course, but I disliked Hemsby so much because the flat\ncountryside I didn't like. I was used to Hampshire which is rolling, and wooded, and\nbeautiful. I was a long way from home too, so was Dover, but I didn't miss it so much. I\nhad got relatives quite near and there was more going on.\n\n01:26:09\n\nI realized that if I learnt Morse they couldn't keep me at Hemsby, because they\ndidn't do it. I would either be at Abbot's Cliff, and I didn't know about Ventnor there, but\nI knew there were other stations, so I think the radio mechanic there would teach you up\nto a certain level. I'd done it in Girl Guide, you know, zero speed, and he'd get you up to\nsort of ten words a minute or something. Then you went back to, I think it was Southfields,\nto have your speeds brought up to twenty-five words a minute and you were taught the\nGerman procedural methods which were marginally different from the English. Then you\ncould be sent to either Abbot's Cliff or Ventnor and I think I was sent to Ventnor.\n\n01:27:45\n\nDid you find that studying it at Southfields in Morse very hard?\n\n01:27:49\n\nNo. No, it was ever so easy.\n\n** Start of Film 4\n\n01:27:53\n\nWhat was Ventnor like?\n\n01:27:54\n\nOh, lovely. Lovely place. I loved it at Ventnor.\n\n01:27:58\n\nWhen did you go there? Was it pre D-Day?\n\n\n\nI was there twice and I was twice at Abbot's Cliff. It was over D-Day, during D-Day, but\nI went there about in '43. I think it was something like September '43. I had just passed\nas a WT operator and that made me into a chief petty officer or chief Wren as they called\nit. Which I think is a bit misleading, it sounds as if you were leading the whole of the\nWrens, if you have a title like chief Wren, and because I think she was referred ... I've\nforgotten her name now. I think she was called the chief Wren.\n\n01:28:00\n\nAnyway, I went there and I loved it because it's beautiful. It's very pretty around\nVentnor. Also, I could get home for forty-eight hours easily, or even thirty-six. Across the\nisland, and that was Solent, and the family then were living in Totton because we couldn't\nlive in our own house in South Hampton. I just felt more at ease there and I think I went\nback to Abbot's Cliff at some stage, but later on. I'm trying to remember when it was. I\nwas certainly, at D-Day, I was certainly at Ventnor and it was a wonderful place to be\nbecause Ventnor's nearly at the southern point of the Isle of Wight.\nIt was glorious morning and somebody came and shook me up and said it's today,\nit's today. They're going. When you went and looked, because we were four hundred feet\nup there, very, very high; you could see a stream of ... They were landing crafts in rows,\ngoing out each side, and because it was a glorious day with blue skies, blue sea, bright\nsunlight, they all looked white. I remember them as white, but they must have been gray.\nI think they were pale gray or something, landing craft, and it was a magnificent sight. It\nalso gave you a rather creepy feeling. I had danced with a sergeant the Saturday before\nand you couldn't help wondering how long he survived. Of course, I didn't know, we'd\nhadn't met before, we just danced, but it did make you think, you know?\n\n01:30:31\n\nHow long were you there afterwards? Did you see the hospital ships coming back?\nNo, no, I wasn't there for that. At some stage I was transferred back to Abbot's Cliff and\nthat was when the V-1s were coming over, the flying bombs. At that stage they'd moved\nthe watch room from an upper floor to a ground floor because we had anti-aircraft guns\nof every description you can think of in all the fields right beside us, and extending in\nvarious directions to try and bring the buzzbombs down before they reached London. For\nthat reason we had a blast wall; we were on the ground floor with a blast wall all the way\nround, and when you heard them sort of cut out, we had earphones on as you have, and\nwe'd just dive under the bench, you know, in the hope that it wasn't going to land on us.\n\n01:30:35\nOf course, they did bring them down quite near sometimes, and one poor gun crew\nwere completely wiped out because it landed on them. You would hear them cut out, you\nknow? The engine you would hear coming towards you and I can't remember whether it\nwas before then or after then that I was in Ventnor, and I was sleeping after a duty, and\nI could hear this buzzbomb coming nearer and nearer, and then it lit up my bedroom with\nits tail, so it was so close. I thought well, this is me. I'm just going to die now, and no it\ndidn't because it went ... It came very close, went into the hillside behind us and because\nthe hill had hummocks the blast was deflected away from us and we had very little\ndamage, but it was enough. Funnily enough, you're just resigned. You think, you know,\nyou're going to go, you're going to go.\n01:32:32\n\nThey were supposed to go to London, weren't they, but I know the POW's that made them\ndeliberately altered the fuses so they'd overshoot or come down ahead of. An awful lot of them\nnever made London or went past London.\n\n\n\n\n01:32:45\n\nDid they? Yes, and I think they sometimes aimed at different places possibly as well, because ... I don't\nknow how, whether Southampton ... I think we thought it was going for Southampton, you see,\nbecause we didn't have many buzzbombs in that area, but your reason is a very good one. Yes.\n\n01:33:05\n\nAfter D-Day, you went back to Dover?\n\n01:33:07\n\nYes.\n\n01:33:08\n\nThis is when it was you [crosstalk 01:33:10].\n\n01:33:11\n\nThat was when we had all the buzzbombs coming over.\n\n01:33:13\n\nYeah, what about the V-2s? Did you ever see the V-2's come?\n\n01:33:17\n\nWell, we met those in London because when our job ... As the armies moved along the\ncoast towards Germany, there was no point in having Ventnor open, for instance, because\nwe'd taken that part of France. Gradually, we were drawn back to London. To occupy us,\nthey had us helping to translate captured documents using enormous technical\ndictionaries and doing the preliminary translations. Then it was handed to naval officers,\nEnglish and Dutch, who had a much better knowledge, and also maybe engineering\nknowledge, which we didn't have.\nI was very amused to find out that there was a word called a stuffing box, so I\nknow the German for stuffing box, and injection jets, but stuffing box was very amusing.\nWe did, as I said, the preliminary and while we were there we lived in a block of flats in\nChain Walk. Mary and I shared a room right at the top, and every so often you'd hear this\nenormous crab-bang and it would be a V-1 landing somewhere or other, but, I mean, you\nhad to take it. It was philosophically. It didn't really worry us. You just accepted it.\n\n01:34:45\n\n01:34:4\n\nWhere were you working when you came to live there?\nI think it was either in admiralty or in some other place which they'd taken over, because\nwe'd translated part of the schnorchel, which is this device the Germans had and we\ndidn't. Our Navy was particularly interested in getting it translated. It was the device by\nwhich they could remain slightly underwater and therefore difficult to see from aircraft\nand so on, and of ships of course, and they could exchange the foul air in the submarine\nfor ... I'm talking about submarines, sorry ... For fresh air, without actually surfacing.\nThey called it the schnorchel because it was like our word snort. The snorter, really.\n\n01:35:41\n\nYou can't remember where that you were doing that though?\n\n01:35:43\n\nWell, I can't remember the actual building. No. No. It wouldn't have been far. We would have walked\nthere, I think.\n\n01:35:53\n\nWhat about VE Day?\n\n\n\nI can't remember that at all. I think we were sent on leave. Those of us who volunteered\nto go to Germany after the war for until our time for being discharged came, were sent\nhome on leave prior to the Lords of the Admiralty, who looked after us very well, deciding\nit was fit for Wrens to go to Germany because, I mean, it was in a pretty awful state\nimmediately after the war. Even when we got there it was in an awful state, so we went\nout in November '45 and we're put into a naval barracks which had been taken over from\nthe German panzers.\n\n01:35:56\n\n01:37:53\n\nMary and I shared a room which had two huge wardrobes in and a space for our\nswords, because presumably it was for I suppose their dress uniform of the panzer army.\nThe panzer who were the tank regiment, so to speak, or the tank core. We were only in\nthe barracks for about, magnificent barracks they had, for about a fortnight. Then we\nwere taken by taxi or limousine to our jobs. Then we were housed, as we were all ... We\nwere a group of eight, POs and CPOs, and accommodated in a very nice block of flats in\nthe center of Hamburg. We were allocated to the Army, lent to the Army, because the\nNavy had plenty of German speakers, more than they needed and the Army needed a lot\nof German speakers.\nI was attached to an Army group who were denazifying the employees of the headquarters\nand district of the German post office in the Hamburg district. We were supposed to be\nassistant interpreters, but I really wasn't good enough for that as I discovered the first\ntime they tried to make me interpret. The new head, they were getting rid of all the Nazi's,\nso the head had already been changed for a non-Nazi. Nice man. We were standing out\nin the street and I was standing with this captain I worked for, Army captain, and he was\nexplaining to the German how we were going to peel away the layers of Nazi's as one\npeeled an onion. I thought, my goodness, what on earth is an onion, how am I going to\ndo that? Fortunately, the German knew a lot of English and he stepped into the breech\nand rescued me, which was very nice.\nThey didn't use me as an interpreter after that. I had jobs like checking inventories\nwhen they took over houses. Going through the inventory and translating it into English.\nAlso, going through questionnaires. All the employees of Hamburg district had to fill in a\nquestionnaire giving their status in the Nazi party. If they were scharfuhrer, which was\nroughly sergeant level, they were out. Although you may think, yes well they're not going\nto be honest are they, but if somebody who is a scharfuhrer has been booted out, he's\ngoing to denounce the ones that stay in. That's how it worked, sort of, if somebody didn't\nget booted out. The questionnaires worked quite well apparently, and then they were\nreplaced by non-Nazis.\n\n** Start of Film 5\n\n01:40:03\n\nWell, Hamburg was devastated wasn't it?\n\n01:40:06\n\nIt was devastated, but there were still buildings. Especially the docks area was really devastated. That\nwas piles of rubble and you would see one room halfway up a block of flats with a bit of smoke coming\nout of it meaning, somebody was living there, because this was six months after the end of the war.\nIt wasn't damage. They would live in whatever they could live in.\n\n01:40:34\n\nDid you see many dead bodies there?\n\n\n\n\n01:40:36\n\nNo, but you could smell them sometimes. You know, you would walk past piles of rubble and this\nsweet-sickly smell would come out. Also, you saw Germans, I could see from the window where we\nhad ... No it wasn't the meal, it can't have been meals, it must have been our flat. We lived in the flat.\nWe had eight of us in one flat, the group that went over, we all lived together. Although we worked\nin different places. You could see Germans going through our dustbins looking for food. They looked\ngrey. Everything was grey, I remember, because the weather was grey. Hamburg gets some of the\ndamp that comes up from the Atlantic and the North Sea and they also get the cold from Germany,\nso it's not a very nice climate.\n\n01:41:35\n\nDo you remember how you felt when you went to Hamburg, or what you saw?\n\n01:41:39\n\nWell, I didn't feel terribly sympathetic because they'd bombed us with a very poorly aimed thing. I\nmean, you can't aim dropping a mine on the end of a parachute in a residential area of the north of\nSouth Hampton. We were about three miles from the port. They bombed terribly badly, what's the\ncathedral town in the middle of England they bombed?\n\n01:42:19\n\nCoventry?\n\n01:42:20\n\nCoventry. That was the first one they did, yes. We hadn't done anything like that, at that time. It was\nway on in the war that we, you know, we had more power and we could bomb more effectively than\nthey could, but they would've bombed us I'm sure, equally effectively if they had been able to.\n\n01:42:42\n\nBy then, you were just resigned to seeing devastation pretty much, you know, wherever you are?\n\n01:42:46\n\nYes, yes. It was devastating, but in the middle of Hamburg, although it was terribly, badly damaged,\nthere were a number of buildings, for instance the NCOs club was the [German 00:43:07] that's\nunderneath the guild hall so to speak, and it was beautiful. Very nice. We used to go there with some\nof the other lads that we discovered did our job. We became friendly with them, and we'd go there\noccasionally, and we'd sing German songs because we all knew lots of beautiful ... I mean, German\nfolk songs are very musical, and pleasant, and we'd sing these. We all knew one which, in my\ninnocence, and the other girl's innocence, we didn't know the full meaning. We knew the meaning of\nthe words but there was a secondary meaning that we didn't get, you see. We innocently sang this\nsong with the lads, you see, and then we saw German faces peering at us sooner the waiters and\nwaitresses; fancy them singing that song. We found out afterwards.\n\n01:44:07\n\nDo you remember the lyrics?\n\n01:44:09\n\nI can tell you the words. [German 00:44:12]. Do you know it?\n\n01:44:31\n\nNo, I don't.\n\n01:44:42\n\nIt says let me in through your little window, and then it says, you see?\n\n01:44:37\n\nOh. How do you reflect on your service as a Wren now?\n\n\n\n\nIf you meet any Wren almost, nowadays, they all enjoyed it. They all look back to it as a period they\nwouldn't have wanted to miss. Even though, as I say, we didn't really have a social time and we had\nvery little to do with the Navy because of the circumstances. We did have a good time when we went\nto Germany. That was terrific because there weren't many English girls over there, so we did have a\nwonderful time over there. No, we enjoyed it and I always felt, as I think I told one of you on the\ntelephone, that our Lords of the Admiralty were really kind old uncles who looked after the Wrens,\nbecause I'll tell you one story that's quite interesting.\n\n01:44:43\n\nWhen we went to Germany, went on our draft, we had to go to Howell and stay in an Army\ntransit camp, which was Nissen Huts in November. The only heating you had in your hut was this iron\nstove in the middle with a sort of bendy, metal pipe going to the ceiling and my bunk was the far end\nso I didn't benefit much from that. It was cold and miserable and the ablutions were sort of three or\nfour things, and you went out and washed in concert, so to speak, not a proper bathroom.\nWhen they got us up at 4am to go on board and they gave us breakfast of brown stew and plum cake,\nand when you'd finished what you could eat of the brown stew, you went over to a dustbin already\nhalf-full of other people's uneaten brown stews and you wiped it into this horrible mess. We then\nembarked for a rough North Sea crossing and the only people in for breakfast the next day was me\nand an Army officer in the far corner of the dining room. My idea of food and accommodation in the\nWACS endured must have been a bit grim.\n\n01:47:10\n\nYou never Mountbatten or anyone like that?\n\n01:47:14\n\nNobody, no. No, I didn't meet anyone.\n\n01:47:17\n\nAny Wrens that stood out? Any famous Wrens?\n\n01:47:19\n\nNo, we had an interesting collection of people. As I said, we had admirals daughters who were not\ncommissioned because an awful lot of the girls in our job were suitable for commissions but there\nweren't that number of ... You could only have one officer in charge of, you know, so many of us. I\nmet people who had the honorable this, and lady so-and-so, who had been brought up where they\nlearnt German, you see. We also had people who'd worked in travel agencies, and traveled abroad,\nand teachers who'd volunteered. So we were a very mixed ... Oh, and Jewish girls who'd probably\ncome over from Germany with their parents in the 30's, early 30's. It was a very interesting group.\n\n01:48:31\n\nVery secretive. You didn't talk.\n\n01:48:34\n\nNo, we didn't talk. No, we can't have because they didn't know about us. If you read about Enigma,\nfor example, you'll find that we absolutely fooled the Germans. They had no idea that we had broken\ntheir codes. Not just ... There were more than one code, there was the Lorenz Code and we used to\nlisten, you could hear the Lorenz machine operating, but of course, you couldn't read it because it\nwas automatic anyway. Very fast and in a different code from Enigma, but they broke that as well,\nbut the Germans didn't realise it.\n\n01:49:18\n\nWhen you say you could hear it ...\n\n\n\n\n01:49:20\n\nWell, it was sent by radio, and you could hear it, and it would be a sort of ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,\nding, ding, ding, ding like that, but you couldn't read it. I mean, they could read it, because and I\nsuppose they could hear, they'd worked out ... You had to receive it on a machine. You couldn't\nreceive it; a human being couldn't take it down at that speed, whatever it was. I don't know quite\nwhat form it had, but you heard it sometimes. You could also hear what they called hellschreiber,\nwhich was a teleprinter. That was very fast too. You couldn't take that either, but it could be taken by\na machine and then rehashed so it was readable and you had to investigate straight signals, of course.\n\n01:50:13\n\nEnd of Films\n\n\n\n", "label": []}

Open order meant that every twenty four hours they checked\nyou just to see if you were still alive and any of your relations come in at\nany time to see myself and my mother of course in the bed by the side of\nme to see if we’re all right. I was baptised in the hospital chapel and\nfortunately I managed to overcome that problem.\n\n01:00:59\n\nWhy did you want to join the Navy and what were the circumstances\naround that?\n\n01:01:01\n\nI think really in those days it’s difficult for people to envisage this now. A\nwar was on and people like myself you wanted to fight back. It’s like a\nburglar trying to break into your door normally you’ll try and stop him and I\nwas doing a certain amount with the ARP (Air Raid Precautions) and I really\nwanted to go a little bit further so I thought about it, and I thought I’ll try and\nget a little bit more involved so I went to the local drill hall where they\nusually take volunteers for any of the three services and this is one in\nEdgware, Deansbrook Road and volunteered for the Navy I came along to\npass all the tests I think there a few weeks later and be they excepted me\nand said a letter would follow, but they couldn’t take me at the time because\nI was only seventeen. They said they would take me at seventeen and a\nhalf providing the job I was going to do in the Navy took about six months\nso I would be eighteen by the time I could go aboard a ship.\n\n01:02:30\n\nSo when I started work on the Monday after that I said to the foreman well\nI’ve joined the Navy and he was going ‘no no you can’t… we want you here\nwe’re doing more work here you don’t have to join the Navy’ I said ‘I’ve\nmade up my mind I’m joining the Navy forget it’ and another bit of luck\nbecause that firm was working a hundred percent with asbestos and at the\ntime there was no problem, but of course I find out later on nearly\neverybody in that firm that I knew died of asbestosis so must have been\nanother one of my lucky… lucky times.\n\n\n\n\n01:03:19\n\nFrom there dead on my age of seventeen and a half a letter arrived report\nto the drill hall where you joined and you’ll be taken on from there to HMS\nRoyal Arthur so dually I turned up there, a little crowd of us and then I a\ntruck I think it was took us to the London station and from the London\nstation a group of us went up to Skegness and there we are at HMS Royal\nArthur. There we did all joining routines, get your uniform and be told lots of\nthings about the Navy. Lots of horror stories I’m afraid to do with what’s\nknown nowadays as… I think it was venereal disease in them days which\nwas rife.\n\n01:04:24\n\nI went on from there after passing all the usual tests to HMS Scotia where I\nwent through the exams for a telegraphist in 1944 I went down from there to\nHMS Royal Arthur again and at that time D-Day was coming up and they\nhad quite enough telegraphists to fit all what they wanted so they said\n‘would you like to change over to something else’ I said ‘well if you need\nsomething else’ he said ‘yes you can become an Able Seaman and from\nthere… there are lots of things you can aim for’ so I thought I like that\nsound of that so although I was a telegraphist because I passed the exams\nwent from there down to HMS Ganges. HMS Ganges was tough you can’t\nsay that hard enough… it was tough after being in somewhere like HMS\nScotia which is quite easy.\n\n01:05:34\n\nWhy was it tough?\n\n01:05:35\n\nWell because you had to be an Able Seaman and an Able Seaman as it\nturned out was a tough job. The one thing because D-Day was coming up\nyou did training to fight on the land as well as fight on the sea so we were\ngoing in for bayonet practice, throwing of hand grenades amongst your\nordinary seamanship jobs and D-Day happened while I was still there and\nwe could hear the fighting going on the other side of Harwich from the\nlandings. And we were giving blood as much as we can for the injured and\nwe were told several times that ‘if the fighting gets any worse and it’s\nhorrific now you’ll be over there joining them whether you are fully trained or\nnot’\n\n01:06:37\n\nSo fortunately fighting although injuries didn’t get tougher than they were so\npassed out as an ordinary seaman and after that I was asked if I wanted to\ndo what was called a Suberate. The Suberate you could be an ASDIC\nOperator, a Gunner, or you could be a Torpedoman. Well as I was already\ntrained as a Telegraphist being a Radar Operator seemed about the next\nstep. So anyway that was another short course on The Isle of Man.\n\n** Start of Film 2\n\n01:07:23\n\nAre these all Stone Frigates that you’ve been training at?\n\n\n\n\n01:07:26\n\nThey are all stone frigates all the land bases are stone frigates so… so far\nI’ve never even seen a ship only little whalers and we did learn to sail and\ndo all the knots and everything at HMS Ganges. So in between that when I\nfinished my telegraphist course and they said to me ‘well we’re not sure if\nwe’ve got enough telegraphists’ they said ‘there is lots of options’ so I said\n‘can I have the options’ they said ‘yep well one nice job that is coming up\nnowadays is a signalman on landing craft’ they said ‘well you’ve done all\nthe training you only have to learn to be a signalman with the flags and so\nforth’ but it came into my head the landing craft with me standing up the\nfront there flag waving and the Germans shooting at the flag waver so I said\n‘no I’m no hero I come here to do a job not be a hero’ so anyway so I\nfinished up as a Radar Operator.\n\n01:08:45\n\nThere was two types of radar operators. There was a Radar P??? and\nRadar Gunnery Control well as I carried out gunnery in HMS Ganges on big\nguns they had six inch heavy guns there that you trained on I operated for\nthe Radar Control Gunnery so I did that course and from there I went down\nto Chatham, which was my base anyway I was a Chatham Rating and\nwaited there for a ship. When you’re waiting for a ship all you do is walk\nabout the barracks jobs like painting coal white or sweeping up all different\nplaces and you go down every evening in your own time to what I believe is\ncalled the big barn and they’ll have lists for people to go on draft for a ship.\n\n01:09:54\n\nWell the first one I came across after going down there for several weeks\nhad my name on there was quite a lot on this draft so we had to go for\nsome reason to have a medical… everyone had to pass for a medical that\nwas on that draft what it was for they never tell you… they never tell you in\nthe Navy it’s known as the silent service… they never told anything.\nAnyway I went for this medical examination as it came to my turn to see the\nmedical officer he said ‘out’ I said ‘why’ ‘out’ so I stand out to one side wait\nfor some time and then came across I said ‘what’s wrong I feel alright’ he\nsaid ‘you’ve got German measles’ well my goodness ‘German measles and\nyou’re fighting the Germans I haven’t been anywhere near Germany’ he\nsaid ‘don’t be funny’ I was out. I spent a few weeks in sickbay I’ve got no\nmemory at all of what happened there, I don’t think anything could of\nhappened, but if you’re going on a draft and you’re going on a ship\nobviously two hundred men upwards on a ship you could pass it on so…\n\n\n\n\n01:11:10\n\nin a few weeks’ time my name was on another draft and this was for HMS\nCarron and we’re not told we’re just told we’re going on a draft and the\nnumber on the draft. So when the time came there was about a hundred\nand fifty to two hundred of us from Chatham. We were put on Navy trucks\nopen back, but covered truck taken down to the London station I’m not sure\nwhich one it was now… but all of us put on one train I don’t think there was\nany other people on that train. Every one of the doors were locked, locked\nin and a young lad by the side of me said ‘you know what that’s for’ I said\n‘yeah to stop us from getting out’ ‘no it’s not it’s to stop the girls getting to us\nwhen we get to a station’ I started to chat, we got friendly.\n\n01:12:12\n\nNone of us ever knew each other we come from all over the place, but\nanyway that was a long trip up to Glasgow. We stopped quite a few times I\nthink for air raids and for no reason. I believe we stopped at Carlisle and\nthe windows were opened on the carriages lovely cups of tea and\nsandwiches passed across from the WVS or whoever now anyway after a\nlittle rest on started the train again. As we drew out of the station I\nremember there was a big factory by the side of the station right on the\ntrack an old mill or something like that and out of the windows there was\nballoons, the girls waving the balloons well not some of the balloons I can\nremember I think they were a little bit of another type, which I won’t\nmention, but anyway that was nice we loved the fact we were being\ncheered on our way.\n\n01:13:22\n\nWe eventually in Glasgow and we changed straight away what must have\nbeen a local train that train took us to Greenock… Greenock was our\ndestination and we were then put in to what must have been a YMCA a big\nbuilding and we were then told that we were due to be a ships company of\na brand new ship that had been built in the ship yard that was right next\ndoor to the YMCA really. Now it wasn’t ready we could go and look over\nthe ship anytime we liked a mass of wires and people welding and I can’t\nreally remember what we did we must of walked around Greenock anyway\nin a few weeks the ship was ready all the old wires and bits and pieces had\nbeen removed and we were given our places on the forehead mess deck,\nwe were pointed out where we had our locker, where we put any clothes we\nwere in uniform now of course our civilian clothes had gone so we just had\nour Royal Naval clothes.\n\n\n\n\n01:14:50\n\nThe first of the things we had to do was go through the trials. The trials\nwere taken up the Clyde to do the speed… whatever was determined and a\nfew gunnery trials anyway when we finished at the trials and the ship was\ncommissioned then into the Royal Navy that was the time we was going to\nbe off none of us was told we were going to go on a certain day so if we\nhappened to be having shore leave we couldn’t tell anybody, but then one\ndark night shortly after we finished our trials we slipped from the dockside of\nthe yard and edged our way up through the Clyde no lights of course, we\nclosed all the water tight doors all the scuttles all the dead lights… and we\nwere given our positions that we were on watch then, we were real sailors\nthen. So I was starboard watch so therefore I would be up on the… half an\nhour on the starboard lookout we never had any actual training for this we\nwere just told to do whatever we were told.\n\n01:16:17\n\nSo anyway we eased out of the Clyde you had to go past the boom which\nlets out the Clyde and I remember I came off watch or I hadn’t gone on\nwatch I can’t remember this stage, but I had reason to go to the head which\nare toilets… I was just sitting down and there is an enormous explosion and\nthe doors rattled… I pulled my trousers up quickly… rushed out of the\ndoor… into what they call the canteen flat that’s the passage way and\nbumped into one of the other sailors who was a little bit more experienced\nthan me… ‘have we been torpedoed on our first night out’ ‘no it’s only the\nTorpedoman trying the depth charges out’ a bit shame faced ‘I didn’t know\nthat’ he said ‘you were in the right place there anyway’ so we had a good\nlaugh about that anyway from there as I say it was a dark night.\n\n** Start of Film 3\n\n01:17:21\n\nWhy was it all so clandestine when you left?\n\n01:17:24\n\nThis is one of the problems the enemy knew that there was ships being built\nnearly all the time and they would come out of the Clyde or come out of the\nTyne or perhaps come out of Ireland and if you can visualise Ireland and\nScotland in narrows…. It’s really wide you know it’s a long distance but it\nnarrows as a continent and therefore ships have to come in and out of that\narea well this was always the places you’d have two or three U-boats just\nlurking hoping for a good kill and whether they ever found out that a ship\nwith spies or anything that was coming out at that time I’ve no idea, but that\nwas the most dangerous part because none of us had worked together.\nWe’d all come out of training we’d had good training in our own jobs, but of\ncourse not as a team because we were not with the same people we were\ntraining with.\n\n\n\n\n01:18:38\n\nSo from there onwards as you go up through the Hebrides it was really a\nfew sailors that had experience and the officers of course that were\nexperienced and you had to have all their knowledge to do what you were\ndoing because you would get no escort you’re a ship completely on your\nown with seventy five percent of the crew never been to sea at all never\neven seen a ship before very often so if we’d been attacked at that time we\nwould have been a sitting duck.\n\n01:19:12\n\nWhen we arrived at Scapa flow, which is relatively safe we go through the\nboom again to get into the flow and from then onwards we do are training.\nWell the training at Scapa Flow really is to get you working as a team. The\nwhole ship has to know exactly what they’re doing the gun crew of four or\nfive has to know how to work together and if you’re in the transmitting\nstation, which is one of the ???? as we were as gunnery control you’d have\nabout ten people in that room, which is only the size of an ordinary sitting\nroom and each one of those has a job to do because on a destroyer, which\nwe were HMS Carron was a destroyer a brand new one as well so nobody\nknew anything about it so we had to learn how to use the fire control table\nas it was when you’ve got eight people on it and all those eight people\nalthough they are trained on something similar in their training they still\nhave to know how to fight if the ships attacked or if we’re attacking another\nship. So that is what was expected of us in the Flow…\n\n01:20:35\n\nBy that time we were so short of destroyers in particular and other escort\nships so not only are we staying in a nice safe area to do our training we\nwere sent out in harness as it was called with another ship that might be\nmore experienced and then there is one that is experienced and one that is\ntraining and that is us so we learnt it the hard way. All our real fighting was\naround that time. At the end of 1944 which was October, November,\nDecember we was around that area so they would send us out with another\nship and this is in one case we was the only ships that were in the Flow\ndestroyers and of course we was duty destroyer and HMS Bullen, which we\ndidn’t know about at that was a ship that got sunk.\n\n01:21:47\n\nSo we was sent out with no basic training on this. We had a call to go to a\nship off Cape Wrath that had been sunk or been torpedoed they didn’t\nactually… our message was not that it had been sunk. That a ship had\nbeen torpedoed two destroyers had to go out to try and help to catch the UBoat that had sunk it and pick up survivors if there was any there. So there\nwas two of us and it seemed from one of the records I’ve looked up the\nother ship that went out with us was another ship that was also working\nout… so there was two destroyers without absolutely no experience at all\nhad to go out to this ship.\n\n\n\n\n01:22:38\n\nI found later in life it was HMS Bullen, which was an escort vessel and they\nhad been looking for a U-Boat. The very U-Boat they had been looking for\nhit one of our ships first so HMS Bullen had been sunk and the other ships\nthat were with her were still looking for the U-Boat. Well the first thing we\ndid was our skipper was very knowledgeable, very experienced and he\nwent to the position where the U-Boat had sunk HMS Bullen. Nobody was\ntold anything, he knew it was HMS Bullen none of us were told. So the first\nthing you do you go around depth charging the whole of the area in case\nthe U-Boat is still there. Well we picked up an echo which told our ASDIC\noperator that there was something down there, which could be the U-Boat\nso we depth charged that area and apparently the echo didn’t move it\nstayed there so we assumed that… that was a U-Boat and it never came\nup, never got any oil, never got anything.\n\n01:24:14\n\nSo at that time in the war the snorkel had only just started, which helped\nthem later on in the war. Now if this U-boat didn’t come up within twenty\nfour hours then it was a dead duck. So we waited around there all night\nwith a boarding party ready to go onto the U-Boat because it would have\nhad to come up for fresh air if it had of been… and then it seemed we had\nto go on another job. I don’t know whether we received the message, but\nwe had to go on an escort job. So we stood down the whole team. we\nstood… this was the next morning we stood down the boarding party and I\nwas looking over the side of the ship, I had no work to do… I was off watch\nI could see in the near distance a magnetic mine float past, but nobody shot\nat it which they might of done usually in case there was a U-Boat down\nthere they would know we was still there. We was on silent routine all night,\nyou never started your engines because you didn’t want that U-Boat if it\nwas still alive down there to know we was still up there waiting. So in the\nend we went back to Scapa Flow and carried on with our learning to fight a\nwar.\n\n** Start of Film 4\n\n01:25:37\n\nTell me about Christmas in Skapa?\n\n\n\n\n01:25:40\n\nWell this I told you about was the 6th of December some more jobs we\nmight of done there I’m not sure, but the next important thing that I can\nremember is that we are not required for work around the Christmas period\nso we were back in Scapa Flow and it was quiet and we were safe, but\nnone of us has had a Christmas away from home before this and there we\nall were in a dead place Scapa Flow… Scapa Flow is a terrible place dead\nas anything and what surprised me there is two hundred on a ship roughly\ntwo hundred ships complement and luckily we had a few amongst us that\nwere experienced and there we were the cooks in the mess making\nChristmas cakes with whatever stuff we could get hold of. We also\nmanaged to get… I’m not sure where from a Christmas tree from\nsomewhere and that is run up on top of the mast on top of every ship at\nChristmas time if they are in harbour they have a Christmas tree run up on\ntop of the ship.\n\n01:27:00\n\nAnd we should have been served I think by the officers being Christmas,\nbut I can’t remember whether we were or not and you’re not allowed to\nhave drink onboard it’s a dry ship, but some of the old ???? saved some of\ntheir rum ration, which you’re not allowed to do because there is a very high\ncharge if you're caught, but the officers normally on a small ship like a\ndestroyer close their eyes to lots of things that they wouldn’t be allowed to\non a big ship that we call a passer ship. So many of the lads that were\nallowed rum, I wasn’t because you’re not allowed rum until you’re twenty\nand I was only eighteen, but out came the rum ration horrible I hate it and\npeople made up things out of paper some ???? paper red green and blue\ncame from different places out of hidey holes and that was made into\ndecorations and we were moored at a buoy there at the time and we would\nsing Christmas songs.\n\n01:28:23\n\nSome people had instruments so we had a small band onboard and I\nsuppose some of our lads that come from homes that never had it bad I\nthink they were very tearful for them. I came from a home that we didn’t\nhave much money so Christmas wasn’t much different. So anyway we all\nenjoyed our first Christmas away from home at a lace like Scapa Flow so\nthat was quiet good.\n\n01:29:00\n\nCommander Wilkinson was our captain and everybody would have given\ntheir life for him really after we’d been with him for a time… although it was\nvery strict… he was a lad the same as us later on in the story when we go\nto the Far East I’ll tell you a little bit more about it. We had water polo\nteams and he was on the team with the lads against the officers and that\nwas the type of person he would be and I think he was boxing champion of\nthe fleet or part of the fleet and yeah he was such a nice person you know\nand there is another case that I will tell you when I go ashore.\n\n\n\n\n01:29:54\n\nBut the next thing we went on really after Christmas was when we really\nstarted learning that there was a war on. We would still go out as a ship\nworking up together, but the first one we went out with I believe two aircraft\ncarriers and this was to be a strike against Norway. We didn’t know until\nwe were out at sea that we were doing this, but there was these two aircraft\ncarriers some more destroyers I think and some other ships now are job\nwas not only to protect one of the carriers, but it was also to act as a life\nboat really when the aircraft took off and I think a couple of these were old\ntype aircraft, I can’t remember the name of them, but they were bi-planes.\n\n01:31:04\n\nNow this was a really rough day and they took off… and I watched them I\nwas on watch all the time and I watched them from the deck and the carrier\nwas bouncing up and down and they took off and I think they carried out or\ntried to carry out their task, but the two I saw come back didn’t make it\nbecause the ship was dancing up and down the aircraft carrier dancing up\nand down and I believe one of them hit the deck and was pushed\noverboard, that’s with the people in it… they can’t take them out pushed\nthem overboard to make room for another one landing and the other one\ndisappeared I think he was given orders to try and fly back to his base or a\nbase because it was too rough to land on the aircraft carrier… we were\ncrash boat I think it was called we went to try and find the aircraft that had\nditched… sadly no aircraft so anyway I think they had to call off the strike\nbecause it was just too dangerous to do anymore flying or anything like\nthat… so that was really a bad beginning to my war… then we went back to\nScapa Flow.\n\n** Start of Film 5\n\n01:32:31\n\nWhen you talk about it being rough how were your see legs?\n\n01:32:34\n\nTerrible I was sea sick most times when I went to sea, but when you are on\nlook out or when you are in the TS which is ??? the TS is down below and\nthat is the transmitting station that takes the… that’s like a relay from the\ndirector tower which is right up the top of the ship through you in the TS to\nthe main armament which is four 4inch guns so I was a communication\nnumber. The director would speak to me the two officers and the director\nwould be speaking to me and I would be speaking to the guns, but apart\nfrom the director would have instruments that would send signals down to\nour big computer the original mechanical computer would send that\ninformation mechanically to the guns, but once I got into a position where\nthere was excitement I forgot all about sea sickness… I was okay so that\nwas a good thing, but normally if I wasn’t on watch I’ll be standing on the\nupper deck watching the sea heaving up and down… probably being sick.\n\n\n\n\n01:34:11\n\nThe only time you go to action stations is when you’re expecting action later\non when we talk about the mine laying we’re at action stations all the time,\nbut if you are doing a job just escorting then you are at cruising stations\nuntil some trouble pops up. Depth charging a U-Boat is not a case of going\nto action stations it’s only if the U-Boat fights back then you go to action\nstations.\n\n01:34:49\n\nSo anyway we went from there back to Scapa Flow I think we did one or\ntwo journeys like this of the Coast of Norway and this is the beginning of\n1945 and eventually we supposedly finished our training learning working\ntogether as a team. Mind you all this time I’m talking about to you now we\nwere still learning because we were still teaming up with people that we\nnever worked with before so if we run into any real trouble at that time we\nwouldn’t of stood a lot of chance. It wasn’t until later on when we learnt\nthese things.\n\n01:35:34\n\nSo the next one I think is an important one this is about February I believe\nwe were just told we were going out that night and we were not given any\nreal information about where we were going and what we were going to do,\nbut it was a very big do. There was a very large force; we left about ten\no’clock at night.\n\n01:36:06\n\nIs this out of Scapa?\n\n01:36:09\n\nThis is out of Scapa this is what turned out to be the mine laying operation\nalthough there was no moon it was all-star light so it was very good visibility\nand it was a very calm night strangely enough hardly any rough sea or\nanything. We set out and you seldom know who is with you… it’s the silent\nservice and we’d been out about an hour I believe about ten o’clock and the\nskipper then said over the tannoy what we’re going to do… he’d opened his\norders and he told us that we are a big force one of the large force was\ngoing down the southern part of Norway to Egersund and they were going\nto attack a convoy.\n\n01:37:14\n\nWe were one of two ships another one was HMS Zealous was a same\ndestroyer as we were and are main task was that we had to escort this\nminelayer HMS Apollo. First of all both forces working together had to pass\nthrough a big minefield there is a big minefield that was laid I think by us\nand we had to go through one path through it, which was the only path\nthrough it, but we knew where the opening was so it should have been safe\nenough, but you do get loose mines so our ASDIC operator had to pick out\nthe mines and I was on watch at one time and I could hear him saying that\nthere is something on the port side and the captain would move the ship\nover a bit. So anyway we got through the minefield all of us with no real\nproblem and then we split up.\n\n\n\n\n01:38:30\n\nWe were to wait until twelve o’clock and at that time at twelve o’clock the\nother big force we were by the way up near Stavanger at that point and the\nother big force was two cruisers I think, no aircraft carriers at that point and\nthey were going to attack a convoy… a German convoy that was going to\nleave Egersund and was going to hug the coast all the way up to\nStavanger, but the other force was to stop them getting there.\n\n01:39:09\n\nSo dead on twelve o’clock the other force that was going to attack the\nconvoy and they were hoping when that started lots of fireworks down along\nthe coast it’s quite a few hundred miles, but that would take the heat off\nwhat we were doing… we were a clandestine operation. We were to escort\nthe Apollo to the point where she was going to start laying mines dead on\ntwelve o’clock and we were to between her and the Norwegian coast and if\nshe was sighted by the Germans or picked up by radar by the Germans and\nthey were to start firing we were to make as much noise as we could and\ntear up and down between the sea between the Apollo and the Norwegian\nCoast and use all the guns and flares and everything we could to take the\nheat of her so they’d attack us.\n\n01:40:25\n\nSo the Apollo would of either flashed us or indicated to us or not I’m not\nsure because everybody had to keep radio silence and we were on silent\nroutine… nobody was allowed to smoke or anything. You were not even\nallowed to bang because the noise… we were not far away from the coast\nour two, but the ships both us and the other escort destroyer the Zealous\nhad to keep up as much steam as we could because if the fireworks started\nwe would have to at full speed rush up and down this bit of coast firing\nwhatever we could to prevent them seeing the Apollo.\n\n01:41:19\n\nWell I could hear from the guns in the TS and from the director before we\nstarted doing anything and I could hear the people on the guns saying ‘I can\nsee the headlights there… there only over there a little bit a car coming\ndown from the right to the left’ I could hear all this and ‘I hope they can’t see\nus where they are’ and then he said ‘right they’ve started down the other\nend’ and they started firing down at the other end they attacked this convoy\nand they would have been…\n\n01:41:55\n\nYou couldn’t see that though?\n\n01:41:57\n\nWe couldn’t… I couldn’t see anything anyway because I was down in the\nTS so I was getting all the messages not from the two officers in the director\ntower, but from my mates on A gun, B gun, X gun and Y gun they were\nfunneling all the information to me ‘saying I think that blokes smoking over\nthere… hope they can’t see us’ apparently they didn’t we didn’t have to do\nmuch. So we were slowly moving up and down and the Apollo started\nlaying her mines dead on time… dead on twelve o’clock\n\n\n\n\n** Start of Film 6\n\n01:42:39\n\nThe minelayer… it’s a big minelayer they carried a lot of mines a big cruiser\nthey are and once they start laying the mine that’s where we would have\nhad to come in they can’t stop they’ve got to do the whole of their mine\nlaying because the mine field is being laid so they can’t turn back, they can\nonly go on and carry on laying their mines. So anyway we’re just going\nslowly up and down and because our ship was keeping steam up ready for\na quick dash up and down the valve blew so you’ve got a normal what is a\nwell-known destroyer hoot woop woop, which we do every time we come in\nand out of harbour just to signal.\n\n01:43:29\n\nAnd apparently everybody went mad the cruisers went mad, we were in\nsilent routine you know and the fact that we were never sussed out not until\nthe very end and I think it might even be if anybody had heard that woop,\nwhich is a well-known British destroyer signal to say I’m coming in to the\nharbour or somewhere if they thought you know it can’t be a British\ndestroyer nobodies daft enough to do a thing like that you know.\n\n01:44:02\n\nSo anyway they laid the mines and then we knew I don’t know by signal or\nwhat just said ‘all done we carried out our mission see you back in port’ and\nI was at that time listening to some of the… and they were saying ‘look at\nher move’ and she was doing forty knots, she was one of the fastest ships\nthere were and they could see the bow wave… it’s night but it was star light\nand you could see… you could see the shore, you could see the place\nwhere the guns were, they would have had a crack at us if they’d known\nand away went the Apollo at speed and we turned around, we went as fast\nas we could, but we were not allowed to go at a good speed because we\ngot a signal that the Germans had sussed out that they were being attacked\nfrom Egersund with the battle we had going on down there and some\nfriends of mine afterwards on the Apollo I kept in touch with them. They\nsaid they understood and they were in the wireless room… telegraphist\noffice they had understood that we had been challenged the force had been\nchallenged because they had picked us up on radar.\n\n01:45:44\n\nThe force had been challenged and he thinks that the Apollo that was in\ncharge of course had given the right challenge answer, but then they\nchallenged again later on and didn’t the Apollo started disappearing so they\nsent torpedo bombers after us and they never found us so we got back\nokay. So the mine laying was successful our force further down at\nEgersund had stopped the convoy going up to… the German convoy had\nsunk one or two of the ships and one or two of are ships had injured people,\nbut this whole mission was successful.\n\n01:46:38\n\nIt sounds to me like you were expendable when you were out there\nwith the Apollo?\n\n\n\n01:46:42\n\nYou are…\n\n01:46:45\n\nI would of though a destroyer was valuable bits of kit… tell me a bit\nabout the role of a destroyer and it’s comparable?\n\n01:46:51\n\nWhat I shall bring in is because later on towards the end of the war which\nwon’t be in that one is when we were a big force escorting some of the\ncruisers out to the Far East we only took them as far as Gibraltar you see\nand then another force takes over, but we were escorting a battleship the\nRenown and we were the close escort on the destroyer each side fairly\nclose when others were further out and it was a beautiful day like this and I\nwasn’t on watch I was just leaning over the side, but we were quite close\nbecause we were close escort you see and I’m just leaning over the side\nand over the tannoy comes the voice from the captain ‘we’re now reaching\na dangerous area and there might be U-Boats around if a U-Boat has fired\na torpedo and we see the track of that torpedo heading towards big sister’\nwhich they called the Renown ‘then we stop it, you know what we mean…\nwe stop it’ and there’s me looking over the side looking and there is a\ntorpedo bulge on the Renown and thinking to myself yes we’re going to lose\ntwo hundred men just to stop a torpedo bending a torpedo bulge you\nknow…\n\n** Start of Film 7\n\n01:48:32\n\nJust tell me a bit about the role of a destroyer?\n\n01:48:36\n\nWell the role of most destroyers is they’re fast and they are maneuverable\nand they’re like a smaller version of a cruisers they have all the gunnery,\nbut smaller guns so they’ve got four big guns 4.5 big guns and other small\nguns got all those. The one thing they’ve got extra apart from the smaller\nsize scaled down. The big ships have not got anti-submarine equipment\nthey’ve got torpedoes and things unless the submarines on the surface\nthey’ve got no depth charges. So a destroyer had depth charges so we are\nthere too…\n\n01:49:26\n\nBut on the other hand the difference the reason why you’ve got a destroyer\nis just as I said if the capital ship or whatever it is we are guarding is\ntorpedoed the last resort is you get in the way of the torpedo they’d rather\nlose a ship that’s only got two hundred men onboard than a possibility of\nlosing more than two hundred men on a battleship remote as it might be\nthat it’s got a torpedo bulge and this is why we we’re short of destroyers\nbecause so many of them get lost because the first thing you do when a\ntorpedo is sighted is go to attack the submarine that fired it, but you should\nbe near enough to get in the way of the torpedo if it happens to be heading\nyou way.\n\n\n\n01:50:26\n\nYou know you talked a bit about how you weren’t a team you were a\nyoung crew is there a moment when you were onboard where you\nthought we’re working brilliantly now?\n\n01:50:38\n\nWell not really you just sort of fit in part of life is you manage to fit into every\nsituation luckily enough I never worried you think because you are a good\nswimmer you must be alright if the ship sinks, but then when you think\nabout it and you speak to other people you’ve got sea boots on at the time,\nyou have a belt which should save you, which you wear all the time at sea,\nbut you can’t wear that belt blown up because it gets in the way of the arms\nand everything so what happens is if you have to jump into the ogin as they\ncall it… the sea that belt mustn’t be blown up because you might break your\narms so you’re expected to blow that up when you hit the sea and I can’t\nsee… luckily I never had too, but I know survivors that have told me ‘I had\nto blow it up as soon as I hit the water, but I had no breath at all left so I\ncouldn’t blow it up’. But the sea boots drag you down because this is what\nyou’re wearing it’s just one of those things.\n\n** Start of Film 8\n\n01:52:10\n\nWhat’s the next big event that you recall then?\n\n01:52:12\n\nIt was really mundane most of the things as escort to the monsters we did\nyour enemy in most cases was the sea we got battered left right and centre\ntrying to keep up with the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth because as we\ntook them out of the Clyde we zig zagged all the way with them and we kept\nup with them until they reached top speed, which was for the distance all\nthe way across then we left them or we either waited around for the next\none coming in. for instance we might of taken the Queen Mary out and we\nmight have had to wait just a few hours for the Queen Elizabeth to come in.\n\n01:53:07\n\nAnd all the time one of you might pick up one of the three of you… the\nQueen Mary would have its own ASDIC besides its own radar and we of\ncourse had the ASDIC and radar and our cohort perhaps the Cavalier\nwould be the same. Well when we’d steam out we would probably be apart\nat the extremes of your ASDIC circle and you radar circle so you didn’t\ninterfere with each other’s receipt of the wave and if we picked up an echo,\nwhich might have been a submarine, might have been a wreck well\nimmediately we’d run up a black flag on our flag deck so the Queen Mary\nwould know and also the Cavalier would know that we’ve picked up an\necho.\n\n\n\n\n01:54:03\n\nImmediately we’d hive off to attack that echo and this is where you are in\ntrouble if it is because a U-Boat might of already fired its torpedo and this is\nwhere you turn off swiftly at full speed if you can, if you’ve got a beam sea\nwhich means you can’t turn off left or right you hit the beam sea a destroyer\nyou’ve got hardly any draft you’ll turn over straight away so you have to be\nvery careful… we never did whether it was luck or judgment I don’t know\nanyway then if you haven’t been hit by a torpedo then you’d find your wave\nto wherever that echo was and you would attack the echo you’d loose of\nabout two depth charges from one side two from the other and roll off from\nthe two racks from the rear a pattern of about ten charges.\n\n01:55:07\n\nWell if the U-Boat is a very experienced one and he was watching you on\nthe periscope he wouldn’t be there when you arrived he’d of either gone\ndown low or he would of disappeared in another direction, but at least\nyou’ve kept him down no chance of hitting your charge… and then we’d\nhave to try and catch it up it takes about half a day because they’re keeping\nthe same speed. If the two destroyers had to leave the Queen Mary or the\nQueen Elizabeth… the Queen Mary would carry on, it wouldn’t stop and\none of the worst things that could of happened if they’d actually torpedoed\nthe Queen Mary then they would of lost a lot of lives because if the Queen\nMary was coming back in it would have a full complement of American GI’s\nand that would be between ten thousand and fifteen thousand it would be\ncarrying now they would not be able to tighten up their water tight doors\nbecause they’re going from the different decks all the time in the twenty four\nhours.\n\n01:56:32\n\nIf we go into action stations then we close our water tight doors, which\nmeans if you’re torpedoed on one side it will only damage the compartment\nwithin so most likely the ship wont sink, but if it’s on the Queen Mary then\nthey’ve got no chance of any of their water tight doors because they’re\ntravelling between the different decks. They’re perhaps sleeping on one\ndeck travelling up the next deck to eat food another deck for exercise… the\ntop deck is always exercise so they couldn’t close their water tight doors so\nany of those would have been one of the biggest disasters you’d find.\n\n01:57:20\n\nWhat was it like seeing the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth\nsailing with you… did you have any pride was they ships that you\nknew of and were proud of anyway?\n\n\n\n\n01:57:28\n\nWell all we really knew was going to pick up one of the monsters or bring\none of the monsters in. if it was the Queen Mary and we were in Greenock\nthen we would of known it was the Queen we were taken out and that’s\nalways got three funnels anyway if we picked it up… if it’s got three funnels\nit’s the Queen Mary, if it’s got two funnels it’s the Queen Elizabeth and so\non you’ve got four funnels with the Aquitania and so it went on. You were\nnever told you would just sail out and go to a rendezvous where you would\nwait around or you’ve already contacted that ship to say you were there and\nyou’d bring it in.\n\n01:58:19\n\nVery often even we two escorts one would be at Greenock at the Clyde and\nthe other would be down at Liverpool and we would meet a point of\nrendezvous going out of the Clyde and the other one Cavalier perhaps\ncome out of Liverpool and then we would steam up together to the\nrendezvous point for the monster. This happened once or twice a week for\none of us we never had the same cohort because they wouldn’t always be\nin the same area, they’d be doing something else and between that if you’re\nduty ship if there was an aircraft carrier which happened in one case had\nbeen torpedoed we’d just come down from Scapa to Greenock and we’d\njust arrived at the harbour entrance we went straight to an oiler because\nyou always have to fill up with oil because you might have to go out\n\n01:59:28\n\nAnd just as we were at the oiler we got an emergency call to say that an\naircraft carrier had been torpedoed just out in the Clyde at the beginning of\nthe Clyde so we just let go from the oiler and straight out to the ???? an\naircraft carrier and strangely enough she was on her own she come from\nLondonderry, she’d had no escort and luckily she didn’t have a full\ncomplement of seaman and so forth and she was coming to the Clyde. I\ndon’t know why, but they torpedoed that. They torpedoed a merchant ship\nat the same time and the U-Boat got away so we went to attack it. It was\ndark and we left the others I think looking for the U-Boat afterwards when\nwe came back into harbour.\n\n** Start of Film 9\n\n02:00:32\n\nHow long are you at sea when you are out in the Atlantic and how\noften are you going back to base and getting your land legs?\n\n\n\n\n02:00:39\n\nIn a destroyer not very long because you haven’t got that much fuel and\nyou’re always using your top speed always maneuvering. The only way of\ngetting fuel if you are out for a long time is from one of the bigger ships\nwither from an aircraft carrier or if it’s as big as the Belfast or a cruiser or\nsomething like that and also food. Your food runs out after a short while so\nthe only time we were really out for a long time is when we were up at\nScapa when we was working up… when we was going out on forays to help\nsink the Tirpitz or doing other jobs.\n\n02:01:25\n\nMost of the others it was a case of going out just for a day or two just\npicking up one of the monsters and then come back with a monster or take\none out and leave it, it which case we would have to go to Londonderry\nperhaps and then we come out of Londonderry again you know and go out\non that so we were lucky on that respect that we were not out for very long.\nThere is only we was out for a very long time it must have been over five\ndays I can’t remember what the occasion was, but we had run out of food\nand we was further up in the North Atlantic and our captain was an ex\nfishery fleet man… he had his own fishery fleet… so what he decided to do\nas we run out of food he said I know where the fish are so he guided the\nship up too where he knew they were, picked up a shoal on the radar, on\nthe ASDIC, dropped a depth charge, lowered a boat, picked up all the fish\nthat came up stunned he stood on the Foc’sle… we saw him stood on the\nFoc’sle and said ‘that one mine’ picked the biggest one and we lived on fish\na few more days after that.\n\n02:02:58\n\nBut our runs were mostly just about five days at a time, but that meant\nevery time we came into either Scapa or if we were in Liverpool or to the\nClyde we had to always have plenty of fuel onboard because if you’re duty\ndestroyer and then something comes up where a ship has been sunk you’d\nhave to go out straight away and you might be out for a long time looking\nfor a submarine or more than a submarine so we were lucky in that fact that\nwe never went out for a long time otherwise it would have been oiling at sea\nwhich is a dangerous practice anyway and picking up food and everything\nfrom it.\n\n02:03:55\n\nCan you just describe radar… this is the job you were doing yes?\n\n\n\n\n02:03:59\n\nRadar yes… well first of all when I was on a radar set it’s only a small set\nand there are different types the 293 that is high up on the mast specially\nfor picking up aircraft or surface ships really any distant I can’t think of the\nrange of it, but it sends out a signal from there, which of course if it doesn’t\nhit anything you don’t get it back, but if it hits anything even cliffs or an\naircraft or a surface ship then it bounces back and on the screen which is a\nround screen and the curser is going around all the time that will show a\nblip and that blip you have to be able to determine whether it’s a cloud,\nwhich it might be depending on your radar if it’s doing vertical or angler and\nthen you’d read off the distance angel and everything. This is mostly on a\nlevel, but you have another screen that gives you the height of an aircraft…\nso you use one with the other. When that electronic signal hits anything\nthen it returns and then you read of the distance of it.\n\n02:05:11\n\nIs it easy to use?\n\n02:05:46\n\nIt’s easier to use where you find the difficulty is by experience very often\nyou know what you are looking at either the land because of the size of it on\nthere if it’s a small blip its and aircraft a ship whatever, if you know you are\nusing one type of radar it’s only horizontal if you’re using the other one it\ncould be horizontal or an aircraft and it would give you a good distance the\ntime it takes of course it’s based on if it takes ten seconds from there to\nthere its… and you read it off the screen. Luckily at our point in the war we\nnever had any trouble with aircraft only times we had problems with that is if\nthe torpedo bombers had been sent after us of Norway then we would have\nhad to use are… then we would know… we’d have to use the two radar\nsets then the one that gives you the signal with the height of the aircraft and\nthe other one that gives the distance of it. Then you are trained to know\nwhich is the distance.\n\n02:07:04\n\nand I also believe as far as I remember if it was one of our own aircraft it\nwould have an identification signal, which you would know on your radar set\nbefore it got to you so you’d have to be pretty well experienced, but my\ntime was not always on a radar set you were sometimes on lookout as a\nseaman where you are sitting up in a lookout box and starboard side was\nmine and you are looking out for aircraft which was not very often, surface\nships or more than likely you’re looking out for a little tiny periscope, which\nis very hard to see in the rough Atlantic or you might be unlucky enough to\nsee the track of a torpedo coming towards you in which case you get into a\npanic and call out quickly to the people on the bridge.\n\n\n\n02:08:00\n\nWhat is said\nThe people on the bridge the captain or the officer on watch at the time in\nthose days it was an open bridge nowadays it’s enclosed, but it was an\nopen bridge so the bridge is here and you’ve got a look out position just\nhere so you just call out to that person on the bridge, duty officer ‘chip\nbearing red 5 0 green 5 0 whatever your position is, angle of site if it was an\naircraft and he can immediately look at it and decide what action to take,\nbut if you’re on that look out position which I was on quite a lot as a seaman\nit’s rough because as the ship goes down all the time being a destroyer\nyou’re almost a submarine at times the whole of the sea comes up over you\nand you get knocked back against the search light and its very damp that is\nvery rough… uncomfortable but this is what you get used to. You used to\nwear a special suit which covered you completely, a water proof suit with\nkapok lining, but even that the water got all the way day and you got\nsoaking wet.\n\n** Start of Film 10\n\n02:09:16\n\nI remember coming off watch on one occasion like this because normally\nyou have to climb down the outside ladders of the ship because the doors\nyou would go in and out in port are open when you are at sea the doors will\nbe closed because the water comes in those so you have to climb down\nladders down the outside of the ship. Not outside in the sea but climb down\nfrom the top deck to the lower deck and if you’re not carful the wave when it\nhits you can get washed away so you hold on very tight.\n\n02:09:57\n\nWell this was the middle watch I recall which is from twelve o’clock at night\nto four o’clock in the morning, but you’re not on watch lookout all that time\non the four hour watch you do different jobs, half hour on lookout, half hour\nperhaps on a radar set, half hour behind A-gun where you become part of\nthe gun crew so if you did have to go into action you would do the shooting\nwhile the real gun crew is called up to take over from you. Well on this\noccasion it had been very wet outside I’d got soaking and tired and say\nmiddle of watch say about one o’clock I’d come down so I went down to my\nmess deck which is in the Foc’sle a rough part of the ship, I hadn’t slung y\nhammock I’d slept on the cushions, this time I didn’t fancy sleeping on the\ncushions because the ship was going so much this way… I knew I’d come\noff the cushions so I got down under the mess table, there’s about that\nmuch water on the floor on the deck about that much I got all my clothes on\na zoot suit they called it if anything and I’m laying down there off to sleep\nstraight away next thing I know a foot had touched me and I opened my\nbleary eyes and there is the officer of the watch and the leading seaman of\nthe mess\n\n\n\n\n02:11:40\n\nAnd he was saying to me and I’m told this in the morning by the leading\nhand in the mess he said ‘come on seaman you can’t sleep under there it is\ntoo wet’ I said… looked at the leading hand and said ‘what did he say?’ and\nthe leading seaman said ‘I don’t know I don’t read that language’ and so we\nbetter let him sleep there and they left me there nothing was said about it\nso.\n\n02:12:08\n\nIn water?\n\n02:12:11\n\nYou’re lying in about that much water on the decks of the ship inside… you\nknow inside your mess deck the water just… its one temperature outside\nand a little bit warmer inside so all the humidity all the water runs down the\ninside of the decks anytime you’re on the Caviler you have a look on the\ninside because the metal work on the ships side is only about an eighth of\nan inch no thicker than that and so you’ve got water all the time on the\nmess decks when you’re at sea and when you’re in harbour you’re not to\nbad. So it gets a bit uncomfortable.\n\n02:12:54\n\nThere was another time when we worked with the Queen Mary and we had\nto pick her up to bring her in. we went out and it was in about one of the\nroughest storms there was about three really rough storms in the period we\nwas working in the Atlantic and we had to about this time… it would be\nabout March 1945 we had to go and pick up the Queen Mary now the storm\nhad been raging all the way from America and it must have been a big\nstorm that ad come across our way and the Queen Mary had brought it with\nher sort of thing and we picked her up. I think we were a day or more\nwaiting to pick her up because even she had been held up by the storm well\nwe and I don’t know what was the sister ship at that time, but we got really\nbent up, we lost a motorboat, we lost one of the whalers and we got really\nknocked about and when we got towards the Clyde… knowing that it was in\nthe area where there would be U-Boats we had to really on our speed…\n\n\n\n\n02:14:19\n\nAnd so as we got within hailing distance of the Clyde the Queen Mary\ndecided she could not slow down to keep up with us because it was tough\nrough for us we might have been turned over and so she just flashed a\nmessage see you in the Clyde ta ta and she kept up her speed and got into\nthe Clyde now she had the whole of the front of her bridge stoved in, it was\na big ship well up in the air, they had a lot of casualties because they are\ncarrying abut twelve thousand troops and this was now late at night I think\nabout eleven o’clock twelve o’clock at night, but anyway she got into the\nClyde without any serious damage from the sea… we limped in later on\nnow in the Clyde you’re not allowed to anchor and we couldn’t go further\ninto Greenock because after that you go through the boom and the boom is\nclosed at night unless it is absolutely necessary to open the boom, which\nprevents or helps to prevent any U-Boats getting in at that point.\n\n02:15:44\n\nSo at the other side where we had to tie up to a buoy we have two buoy\njumpers to tie up to a boy when the ship tops and you have to lower your\nwhaler with the buoy jumper and the rower in it to take you to the buoy with\na chain to clip it to the buoy well if I’ve given you a picture of how rough the\nstorm was it was almost impossible really… we let down onto the water\nmanaged to get down safely that got washed away with the crew in it\nfurther down the Clyde that was a way three or four hours. We managed to\nlower another whaler. All of us were up on the foc’sle all the seaman that\ncould help was up on the foc’sle because you can’t use your anchor, you’re\njust using your anchor chain, which goes with a wire attached to the end of\nthe anchor chain and the whaler has to take this wire to the buoy to clamp it\nonto the buoy and the buoys pulled by the anchor chain nearer to the ship\nso they then clip it on.\n\n02:17:09\n\nSo anyway we lowered the second whaler the buoy jumper managed to get\nonto the buoy and in doing so broke his wrist and in the end after I think\nabout four hours we managed to clip up to the buoy and the captain said\n‘tots all round’ I hated the smell of rum anyway and never would have my\ntot because it’s horrible, but I had it that night because we were frozen…\nfrozen stiff we managed to get away with it nothing is said about this type of\nthing because although people of the ports new these big ships come in it\nwas not a thing that was talked about because the Germans also knew that\nthey were bringing all these large numbers between ten and fifteen\nthousand troops it could carry and any of the U-Boat captains that I\nunderstand and this is normal knowledge were offered a large sum of\nmoney thousands of Deutsche Mark (Reichsmark) and the highest honours\nto have knocked down any of these monsters, but we never lost one\nfortunately I’m happy to say, but the Queen Mary was really battered very\nbadly battered how we didn’t get turned over I have no idea…\n\n\n\n\n** Start of Film 11\n\n02:18:56\n\nWhen you are talking about big seas what sort of size are you talking?\n\n02:19:00\n\nWell if you’re talking… is it the seas themselves you’re talking about. Well it\nis genuinely know that some of the waves were sixty foot high now if you’re\nthinking of sixty foot going up that way you go up to the wave… and you\ncome down to the trough you’ve got a hundred and twenty foot and there is\nno way you can cut through those waves, the big ships and the small ships\nyou actually go up on that wave and then you feel it and then you come\ndown with a crunch like that and then you go up the next one and all the\ntime you’re corkscrewing you know you’re not still and you get used to this\nafter about the first few months because you’ve got bruises all over the\nplace… you go through the normal flats they’re called on the destroyer\nnormal corridor on the floor on a destroyer, which is about that wide.\n\n02:20:10\n\nWhen you first go aboard one like that fairly calm when we set out for\nScapa from Greenock, but as you walk along the deck comes up to meet\nyou as it comes up and you hit your feet as you go down on the deck, but\nbefore you know it that deck has gone away as the ship goes down and this\nhits you from the top and then while that is happening because you’re doing\nthis… this bulkhead hits you next thing you know that bulk head hits you so\nin time you learn to walk like a sailor and if the ship goes down you go down\nwith it and come up with it you find sailors when you get ashore they walk\nwith a roll that is just that they’re still walking on the ship.\n\n02:21:08\n\nSo after the end of the war VE-Day you’re not finished?\n\n02:21:14\n\nVE-Day itself we were that’s the 9th of May we were bringing in the SS Ile\nde France and when we got notice that peace had been declared next day\nwe were going into Greenock so we actually brought in the last of the one\nship convoys before the war ended and we arrived in Greenock it was\neither Wednesday or Sunday half the ships company was allowed leave,\nwhich wasn’t me I’m afraid I wasn’t one of the ships company, but they went\nashore to Greenock and had a good time.\n\n02:22:04\n\nSo then we still carried on with some of these convoys after there because\nthere was quite a few U-Boats apparently missing a lot of them one or two\nof them went to Brazil or whatever so there was still a chance if there was a\nrogue U-Boat around they could of knocked down some of the monsters we\nwere still bringing back in, but we had no problems at all, but to cut a long\nstory short anyway we were then destined to go across to the end of the\nJapanese war so two by two flotilla went in for refits.\n\n\n\n\n02:22:55\n\nWe went in for a refit late in May – June because we were going out there\nanyway, but fortunately when I was on leave to go out there the ship was\ndown at Devonport being refitted the war ended. I’ve still got a telegram to\nsay days leave extra… days leave extra. When we came back to the ship\nwe still had to go out there because we were having to clear up after the\nwar well the whole of our flotilla was out there then we were the last two so\nas we went out Gibraltar, Malta, Aden and places like that we thought we\nwas in for a lovely summers cruise, but when we got to Singapore, no when\nwe got to Trincomalee that was a naval base we were based at\nTrincomalee and we were also based at Singapore.\n\n02:23:57\n\nWell when we got to Singapore this was just about a week or two after the\nwar and we were carrying out an exercise with HMS Sussex and another\nship and the captain… the flotilla leader was on HMS Caesar and ourselves\non Cavalier were ordered to go with the Sussex to a problem so we\nimmediately went at full speed we were sent to Java we stopped on a\ncouple of troop ships on the way I can’t remember much about that little bit,\nbut we took onboard… a full deck was covered with Indian troops, armed\nIndian troops and the Cavalier was the same, the Caesar was also and the\nSussex anchored outside Surabaya because it couldn’t get in, we could\nhardly get in because there was a sunken Japanese cruiser in there in the\nway.\n\n02:25:10\n\nSo the Caesar went in first because she was flotilla leader full of troops and\nwe went in second because we were second and then the Cavalier\nafterwards as we went in… it was daylight, we had all these troops onboard\nso if we had any trouble we couldn’t of used our guns because of the troops\nluckily we didn’t have any trouble from the shore, but as we came into\nSurabaya I was looking over the side and there was bodies dozens of them\nin white naval uniforms I think they were probably Dutch, I don’t think they\nwas ours, but we were slowly moving avoiding this wreckage and avoiding\nthe bodies and you got to the stage now when really bodies in the water\nmade no difference to you… you accepted the fact they were bodies dead\nyou know.\n\n02:26:12\n\nSo anyway we slowly moved in we anchored in the dock there and one by\none the cruiser disembarked her troops first and we came in next so the\nthree of us all our troops went ashore. The docks had already been taken\nover by the UK army I think had been brought in ahead and it was the\nIndonesian Rebels they were fighting they already had killed Brigadier\nMallaby the army boss and these troops went ashore and we stayed there\nready for a lot of survivors of the Dutch people they were going to be\nbrought across from a camp right on the other side of Surabaya and they\nwere going to be brought under escort under another truce… see Brigadier\nMallaby had been killed under another truce.\n\n\n\n\n02:27:30\n\nNow this was supposed to be four thousand Dutch people women and\nchildren mostly in a camp the other side they were going to be brought\nacross by another truce army trucks guarded by Indian troops they were\ngoing to be brought across to us and we were going to have them onboard\nand we were to take them out to the troopers, which couldn’t get into the\nharbour well we were told while we were waiting for these people to come\nacross we were to go out into the water because we might be used, which\nwas absolutely necessary as it happened when this convoy of army trucks\nguarded by Indian troops got as far as Surabaya they were found they were\nstopped even though they had a white flag… they were stopped by the post\noffice which was full of Indonesian rebels.\n\n02:28:33\n\nThe Indian rebels had set up trench mortars and machine guns and as soon\nas the convoy got there they shot the troops that were guarding the convoy\nand the convoy come to a halt so we were called in to use are 4.5 guns so\nwe had to fire on the town and we took out the post office with the\nIndonesian troops in it and then the convoy come through, we went back\ninto harbour and we had all the Dutch people on board and we took them\nout. We didn’t personally have to go ashore. I had to go ashore later on to\nguard some of the warehouses and so on but we didn’t have to do any\nfighting the only fighting we had to do was fire the guns… because I was on\nthe upper deck at the time when we were called in to fire and I was called\noff the upper deck to fire X and Y gun and I said ‘I’m not a gunner’ they said\n‘you are today’ they put me on the gun gunnery with another one and we\nhad to fire and we had to fire in the direction of a spotter plane that was\nsent up by the army… the army sent up a spotter plane so apparently we\ntook out the post office so our good deed was done for the day.\n\n02:30:04\n\nWe did have them aboard overnight a lot of these Dutch people we vacated\nall the forehead mess decks and we had to sleep down aft on the upper\ndecks and different places and the Dutch people women and children until\nwe took them out to the other ships and then we got our place back… I lost\na pair of sandals they disappeared.\n\n** Start of Film 12\n\n02:30:34\n\nHow do you feel when you’re sailing into a harbour and seeing a lot of\ndead naval people?\n\n\n\n\n02:30:40\n\nWell you’re apprehensive to start with, but at the age you are you’re very\nseldom frightened I suppose your adrenaline comes back later on and you\nthink to yourself well I could have been killed there, but I wasn’t and that’s\nhow you took it. If you thought of all these things at the time you’d be a\nnervous wreck but you’re eighteen years old, nineteen years old and if\nanything happens then fortunately you accept it’s not fear. Sometimes I\nlook back now and think I could have been killed there, but I’m not I’m here\nso we accept it just as a fact of life. It was exciting…\n\n02:31:42\n\nIt’s quite a big way to end your naval service really to be involved in a\ncontact like that?\n\n02:31:52\n\nIt is nice to be at this stage and know that you have done certain jobs… well\nwe must of killed people by taking out the post office, but you didn’t see\nthem and you know by doing that you helped to save the last of perhaps\ntwo or three hundred of four thousand people and I had the same feeling\nwhen we were escorting the troopers the fact that we never knew that we’d\nsunk a submarine a U-Boat because we never stayed long enough all we\ncould do was depth charge a target. If that target was a U-Boat then we\nmight of sunk it or it might of got away, but our real job was to look after a\nship coming in with fifteen thousand troops and as long as we’d saved that\nI’m happy, but you never know but I just hope we didn’t I just hope there\nwasn’t a U-Boat there and those people weren’t killed they were only doing\nthe sort of thing we were doing and that was the job.\n\n02:33:15\n\nEnd of FIlms\n\n\n", "label": []}

My\nfather was a lighterman, that is he worked on the River Thames with tugs\nand barges and the family had been doing that for some what… 300\nyears… yes. So I always wanted to work on the river and when I was 15\nleft school became apprentice and worked a float started off as a boat\nboy. I was very very fortunate in that in those days it was quite common\nand everyday thing for barges to be rowed, you know 50 ton barges\nrowed by one man anything between 50 ton carrying capacity and 150\nhad to have one man, one licensed man and another and of course the\nother was always the apprentice.\n\n01:01:07\n\nSo I learnt to do that, but I was especially fortunate because the firm I\nworked for was the last firm to engage in the practice of towing those\nbarges, 150 ton barges, with a rowing boat and I became the boat boy, I\nwould have a man join me and they’d be two men on the barge, which\nwas required by law and we would tow it and you take a stroke and the\nrope pulls up and it contracts and you’re going backwards, you have\nmuscles on your muscles.\n\n01:01:46\n\nSo can you tell me Ted when and why you joined up?\n\n01:01:51\n\nWell I was a 5th year apprentice, in my 5th year when the war started so I\njoined up and I joined The Royal Engineers as a Sapper Waterman, half a\ncrown a day equivalent to 12 ½ pence these days and I was immediately\nsent to a field company well went to Chatham, Kitchener Barracks Chatham\nthen to the 229 Field Company who were a territorial unit in the 49th West\nriding Division, hence the white roses.\n\n01:02:34\n\nBecause battledress was in short supply and it was a territorial unit the\nquartermaster had service dress, brass buttons, chin cutter hats (peak cap\nwith leather chin strap) And at the top of each sleeve was a white rose. So\nI had one of these for some 3 months and eventually before going overseas\nwas issued with proper battledress and when I had to hand my service\ndress in much regret, I looked very very smart, I removed the white roses\nand I gave one away to another sapper who was also in the 49th Division\nand had a cloth one he envied these so I didn’t mind giving up one.\n\n\n01:03:23\n\nWhat was your training like?\n\n01:03:25\n\nWell we did the normal basic training. It was as I remember it in those days\n‘manual of field engineering volume two’ it was the bible, it was a green\nthing and it was blocks and tackles and use of spars and all kinds of things\nbecause for me we were up in Yorkshire at a place just outside Ripon,\nCophewick and we came down to Wallingford for a fortnights pontoon\ntraining, just upstream from Wallingford Bridge.\n\n01:04:01\n\nNow the territorial unit people they’d been to Scarborough and done their\nsummer camp, but they weren’t really expert oarsman and rowing on a\npontoon with your legs out straight is rather difficult, you feel it behind the\nknees and the river had been in flood and had flooded the flood plain, the\ngrass on either side and just dropped sufficiently to come back to its normal\nsummer banks and so it was at its fastest. Someone who rowed for a\ncollege eight up there has since told me that it was about 4 knots, that’s\npretty fast.\n\n01:04:44\n\nAnd so our pontoon rafts had to be built, constructed up stream and by the\ntime they rowed across they’d travelled quite a bit downstream to the\nbridging side and the difficulties came when we had to dismantle the bridge\nand someone eventually found out that there was a waterman in the\ncompany sapper Hunt. We were supposed to have four, but I was the only\none and one of these rafts actually went down through Wallingford Bridge\nluckily without mishap and so I was asked how would you bring the last raft\nback because the last one has got to bring the half floating bay and instead\nof having I think eight rowers there was only room for six.\n\n01:05:38\n\nSo I said having carried out… gone to work with my father when I was a\nschoolboy he as a lighterman his job was each day to bring the loaded\nbarges ashore, he worked for Tate and Lyles at Plaistow Wharf just above\nWoolwich and these loaded barges 200 tons of sugar would be moored up\nat the buoys of a float and when the tide came in he would bring them\nashore to be offloaded and the sugar would go in for refining, though he\nbecame an expert in shearing barges ashore. Now there’s a great art,\npeople don’t know that it is done. What happens is: if you hold a barge at\nan angle by tying the rope up on shall we say on one side of the barge a\nlittle bit back from four foot right forehead then it is held at an angle to the\nstream and in the same way as a kite would shear upwards and overcome\nthe force of gravity, a barge can be made to go sideways.\n\n\n\n\n01:06:51\n\nNow if the rope, the really then becomes the radius of a circle and the barge\ntravels along the circumference actually going up stream. So with a 3 knot\ntide running on the Ebb, this barge is travelling across on its way towards\nthe burst where it will be discharged and I learned from my father that the\nart in shearing is knowing exactly when to let go and you wait for just when\nshe begins to turn at that moment there’s a vortex, there’s a bit of a hole in\nthe water on the lee bow and that straightens her up and she shoots in\nshore and I did this with the raft and because it was the last one, you could\nimagine there was about 120 men ashore waiting to see the last one\nbecause they expected us to go down to the bridge,\n\n01:07:52\n\nBut having any rope that you like, have any length from the stores field park\npickets driven into the bank. I had a Jersey fisherman who knew how to\nhandle an ore standing right aft and away she went I tucked the bite\nunderneath the fender, which was like the handle on the pontoon and you\ncan imagine being sort of catamaran you got two bearing surfaces sheared\nbeautifully, it was like a box kite and of course she came towards\nmidstream climbed up stream let go fell along side and she finished up\nopposite were she started.\n\n01:08:34\n\nNow my mates afterwards said well it’s impossible no-one rowed because\nthe six members sitting there with the oars in the upright position. Now our\nRSM had been posted to the company about a week before when he saw\nthis performance and he was very very impressed because he hadn’t seen\nit done before.\n\n01:08:59\n\nThat was just before Christmas, Christmas leave. In January I was one of\nthe sappers put on a cadre course for my lance corporal stripe. We were\nprepared to go; well actually we went to Norway as part of The North\nWestern Expeditionary Force (NWEF). Now it’s not widely known, but its\nno secret there is a book called ‘Narvik’ where the truth is there for all to\nread. The intention of war office that we would invade Norway to capture\nthe ice free port of Narvik, Norway was neutral because the Baltic was\nfrozen up and all the Swedish iron ore went on a railway line through the\nmountains and finished up at Narvik, which was an ice free port warmed by\nthe Gulf Stream.\n\n01:10:01\n\nSo we wanted to ensure that we had a good supply off iron ore for the rest\nof the war and the Germans had the same idea. Now we know they knew\nwe were going and they got there first. So I was actually on a boat, Polish\ntroop ship called ‘Batory’. On the 6th of April knowing that I was one of\nthose about to invade Norway and we were in Scapa Flow on the 9th when\nwe heard on the radio that the Germans had marched in ahead of us.\n\n\n\n\n01:10:41\n\nIt took about 4 days to get across zig zaging we landed on the island of\nHinnoya, Harstad there were Scots Guards and Irish Guards there, we were\nin good company and eventually we went to a little hamlet about 19 miles\nfrom Narvik a place called Ebon??? and our job, snow cover of course it\nwas very very cold instead of doing 2 hours on sentry and 4 hours off you\ndid 10 minutes on 20 minutes off so we had no sleep at night. Are Artic\ngear was first class, I understand it had originally been made because there\nwas an intention for us to go to the aid of the Fins when it was attacked by\nRussia, but luckily that did not happen.\n\n01:11:40\n\nSo the Artic gear was very good now our job at Ebon??? To turn fourteen\nseparate fields that were covered in snow into one long one to make an\nairstrip for fighter planes to land and this is what we did we had Norwegian\nhorses and sledges and we got rid of the snow, but more importantly these\nfourteen fields were separated by ditches to drain the melting water down\ninto the fjord and we made box drains of wood, wooden boxes all joined\ntogether and filled the ditch end, so we made fourteen fields into one. Now\nthis took 4 weeks actually, during that time our AKAK defence was one of\ntwo anti-aircraft cruisers that we had in the navy at the time, The Coventry\nand The Curlew.\n\n01:12:42\n\nThe Coventry was our AKAK defence for a fortnight and each day fair to\nsay everyday on three or four occasions during the day a Messerschmitt\n110, twin engine German fighter bomber would come of the fjords, which\nwere over the mountains on the other side of the fjord dived down and\ndropped three bombs and miss and in all the rounds that went up heavy\nstarting… pom pom then light machine gun fire they never brought a plane\ndown and Coventry withstood this for 2 weeks then her place was taken\nover by The Curlew and she lasted 2 weeks, but on the last day and the\nday we actually finished building the airstrip and about 3 hours before the\nHurricanes arrived, The Curlew was hit with a loss of forty men, but they did\nget her ashore and everyone else came ashore. One of our sappers\nactually had a camera and I had a photo of her with her head up on the\nshore and her awash aft. She was only there for 3 or 4 hours I think and\nslid of and turned over and disappeared.\n\n01:14:04\n\nI met a lighterman some years after and he’d lost his son on The Curlew so\nI passed the photograph onto him. I was able to say half pasted six on\nSunday the 26th of May The Curlew was lost at that place. Now I’ve had a\nlook at a recent map of Norway and I think there’s still a landing strip there,\nso they made good use of it. So that’s how we spent our time.\n\n** Start of Film 2\n\n01:14:35\n\nWhere did you go to after Norway?\n\n\n\n\n01:14:39\n\nWell actually we left Norway in a hurry because on the 28th of May, 26th the\nHurricanes arrive 2 days later we captured Narvik and then we were\nsurprised to get the order to damage the port installations as far as we\ncould so we… as a waterman I knew something about ports so I was one of\nthe group, section one went and did this job. So we damaged the cranes,\nthe quays, the railway lines coming through a tunnel from Sweden and\nimmediately after I left we burnt up all our… we burnt all our sleeping bags,\nwhich were really first class and The Destroyer Walker got us away from\nthere around about the 5th of June and put us on The Lancastria so\ntransferring from Walker to Lancastria there was a gangway leading from\nthe bridge through the catering port in the side of the ship and with the\ndestroyer rolling it was a bit chancy, took a long time.\n\n01:15:49\n\nLancastria was full up… 4 days put us out at Gourock on the 10 th of June\nthe day Italy decided to come into the war on the side of the winning group,\nand we busied ourselves with defences, built an anti-tank ditch right across\nthe Fife from Kirkcaldy to Newport (Newport-on-Tay) moved down to East\nAnglia then it was machine gun posts and various other things in East\nAnglia because we expected to be invaded.\n\n01:16:26\n\nNow in 1941 war office found I was a licensed lighterman, now the trade of\nlighterman was brought in and that was a B group and waterman was a D\ngroup and I felt originally quite happy to leave my field company and I went\nto IWT, Inland Water Transport Royal Engineers and anyway they were\nmostly much older than myself who had been called up or joined up and to\nthem I was the boat boy and by then I was a substandard corporal it was\nrather difficult. So I was… soon after I joined them and trade tested I went\non draft at Longmore in Hampshire RGFXK it was the draft destined for\nNorth Africa fitted out with tropical gear and that went on and on and on and\nsometime in June I think Hitler invaded Russia.\n\n01:17:40\n\nSo that draft was cancelled and it was decided we would supply Russia with\nequipment through the port of Basra. We was giving them help through the\nback door so to speak so I went back to our WC and told my OC, he was\nthen major Gayslee who ran a firm of tugs on the River Thames, one of the\nbest firms really that I was a bit unhappy with my situation working with\nfreeman who were older than I and still looked upon me as the boat boy\nshall we say and he said “if I could possibly get you back to your field\ncompany I will” and he was successful possibly the only lighterman that\never did it, but that only lasted about 3 months.\n\n\n\n\n01:18:41\n\nAt the beginning of 42 by then I was a sergeant I was posted to 947 in the\nworld of transport company. There I found they were all new recruits, they\nwere I think 18’s or 19’s and I think around about 40 years old the extreme\nend of the call up group and the OC said “well with your battle experience\nand the fact you were a sergeant” reduced to corporal on posting was the\nhabit in those days “you’ll get your tape back in no time” and that was true.\nThen I was a full sergeant, then when the establishment went up to three\nWO’s a sergeant major and two WO Techs… WO2 Techs I wore the\npoached egg as a sergeant major and I was then 22, which was not bad\ngoing.\n\n01:19:42\n\nSo I was tug skipper of a very fine tug I had and eventually the OC decided\nwhen asked to recommend someone for OC2 training he gave me the offer,\nso I took it up and went to a special OC2 for senior NCO’s and warrant\nofficers at Dunbar. So we had just 5 weeks of OC2 training and it was\npretty grim up there, they really put us through it. So I was commissioned\non Christmas eve 1942, home on leave for Christmas.\n\n** Start of Film 3\n\n01:20:34\n\nCan you tell me about your preparations for D-Day, how you believed\nyou were going to be involved and the feelings you had beforehand?\n\n01:20:42\n\nWell by the end of 1943 it was pretty clear that D-Day was on the horizon\nand I had a detachment of army lighterman in the Tower of London of all\nplaces and living on Shooters Hill it was jolly nice and our job was to move\ncraft destined for the invasion from London up to Ham docks just outside\nLondon. They were concrete petrol barges, barges actually made of\nreinforced 3inch reinforced concrete and Thames barges, which had a\ncouple of years earlier been quickly made up to look like invasion barges\nand moored at Harwich and places like that to give the impression, the\nGermans the impression we were about to invade and they were successful\nbecause a number of divisions were withdrawn from the Russian front.\n\n01:21:44\n\nThen when the time came nearer it was decided not to waste them, the\nNavy took the pick and we had what was left. So I had quite a number of\nThames barges swim-ended barges with their sterns cut off and ramps\nfitted, two engines put in and I had those with the fleet. I was with 953\nInland Water Transport Company when someone as a lieutenant the end of\n43 when I was made a staff captain at war office and sent to war office and\ndidn’t like that at all, I wasn’t really an in tray out tray pending tray man as\nyou can imagine I was a 5th year apprentice that wasn’t my experience at all\nand then when Colonel Gayslee arrived and said we have these marvellous\ninvasion craft that were perfected in the Mediterranean, there unsinkable.\n\n\n\n\n01:22:51\n\nThere 180 foot long, 42 foot wide, there just 5 foot deep, there pontoons\nself-propelled, just 5 foot from bottom to the deck, had 2 engines on a ramp\nforehead and there designed so that LST or, vehicles and guns equipment\ncould be landed on beaches, which were not suitable for LSTs to land. It\nshould be appreciated that an LST, which could carry 80-100 vehicles in\ntwo decks, 350 foot long when they are ready for beaching there 9 foot\ndeep aft and 3 foot deep for head. So ideally they should be put on\nbeaches, which have a slope of something like 1 in 30 or 1 in 40.\n\n01:23:46\n\nNow eventually it was decided that we should land in Normandy for a\nnumber of reasons. What evidently war office decided that if we attempted\nto land at any of those places, which were very well defended success was\nvery very doubtful and we should consider landing at a place that was\nconsidered not desirable for LSDs. Now Normandy was chosen because\nyou can say the coming up to the land itself the approach, there was an\napproach that has a slope of 1 in 300 and then the beach itself, that’s the bit\nthat is sometimes dry when there’s a high water leap tide. So that sandy bit\nof soft beach had a nice slope of 1 in 30, but after from then on it went out\nfor kilometre slope of 1 in 300.\n\n01:24:58\n\nSo this meant that LSDs would have to come in at high water time now\nRommel was put in charge of the defences along there in the summer of 43\nand he asked when arriving, why isn’t this place defended. Well they won’t\ncome here because its unsuitable for LSTs and evidentially he said they\ncan land anywhere and as a result of what he did some defences were put\nin place just before the sandy bit because he believed that we would rely\nheavily on LSTs and the only time we could land there would be at high\nwater. If they came in at any other time they would run aground with 9 foot\nof water aft and 8 foot for head and would have to sit there and wait for the\nwater to drop and so they would be sitting ducks.\n\n01:25:57\n\nSo he said they would have to come at high water and all the defences will\nbe put there. Well now someone decided that no LSTs would land a beach\nwhilst the beach was under fire and that the last mile would be done by a\nfleet of ferry craft. Now the ferry craft ranged from an LCM, which carried\none vehicle and LCTs that carried possibly up to twelve I’m not sure about\nthat, but then way ahead of them was the Rhino ferry 7000 square feet of\ndeck space unsinkable because they were made up of 180 separate steel\nboxes, each measuring 5 foot by 5 foot by 7 foot and we could put vehicles\nashore in 2 foot 6 of water.\n\n01:26:54\n\nTed can interrupt you there and ask what where your feelings going\ninto D-Day, your responsible for quite a large number of people and a\nlarge number of ships?\n\n\n\n\n01:27:04\n\nWell you know the British and Canadian forces were Sword, Juno and Gold.\nWell my company had all the responsibilities for the Rhinos on Gold so I\nhad 15 of these now we joined up with our ship around about the 2 nd of\nJune I believe in The Solent and we had been on exercise at Hayling Island\npreviously and learned quite a bit about the problems it was decided during\nthose exercises that we should have our own bulldozers to give us a shove\noff because the propellers were a bit suspect in shallow water and so those\nbulldozers were chained to the deck and the RB19 cranes that we used by\nRESC people they were chained to the deck because they didn’t go into an\nLST very well\n\n01:28:01\n\nAnd well D-Day was supposed to be 5th of June, but it was postponed and\nwe left on the night of the 5th round about 10:00 or 11:00 it was still light.\nPast the needles and I was pretty sure or convinced that they must know\nwe was coming. If you’ve got 2000 ships in the Solent all you need is one\nagent on The Isle of White and I imagined that it would be pretty horrible\nwhen we got there, but it was horrible enough, but I had taken the\nprecaution about a fortnight before D-Day. I’d attended a meeting at a\nplace called a brick ship called H.M.S Squid. The admiral in charge there\nand there were officers who were responsible for a variety of things and my\nresponsibility… I was the ‘Rhino King’ and on our last meeting we were told\nthat it would be the last and we were asked to name one thing, which\nworried us more than anything else and I said well when we get over there I\nimagine everything will be going ashore and nothing will be coming of a\nfloat.\n\n01:29:18\n\nAnd I know my men will carry on working until they run out of things to eat,\nso if they go 3 days without something to eat and at that there was general\nlaughter you know you could predict that somehow there craft would finish\nup on the shore unable to get a float. So this admiral came out with words I\nnever thought anyone could give other than Churchill he said “ oh no you\nneedn’t worry about that I will send a signal to every ship in Gold force that\nwhenever a Rhino crew come along side requiring a hot meal they shall be\ngiven one” and I’ve copied the top secret information that states that.\n\n01:30:28\n\nAlthough feeding is an army matter every vessel must be prepared to give\nRhino crews a meal because every effort must be made to keep the Rhinos\nworking. So we were the blue eyed boys that whatever we wanted we got\nso we arrived D-Day morning it was pretty lively, I thought I’d be in the first\none ashore, but QMS Tech Newcome a fellow apprentice of mine he had\nthe first one because they wore a poached egg so we always called them\nsergeant major Newcome you can’t call someone QMS Tech. So\nNewcome had the first one in and I’m not sure because we were split up.\n\n\n\n\n01:31:03\n\nHalf the ships in Gold force were American LSTs and the one I went over\non was American. Now the most gratifying of morale raising thing that I\ncane across was that one in four LSTs was fitted out as a hospital carrier,\nthey could not be called hospital ships because they were armed, but they\nhad pipe cots in the tank deck, there were REMCs surgeons aboard the\nward room was the operating theatre, so when I had my breakfast over the\ntable there was this huge operating theatre lights.\n\n01:31:46\n\nYou can imagine breakfast was a rather silent affair and what happened we\narrive, we were towed over on the LSTs stern anchor wire we were put\naboard by LCVP by the crew unfasten the wire while we motored around\nthe front of the LST, they put their anchor on line anchor, the doors would\nopen and the ramp would come down and rest on the back end of the\nRhino and immediately all the vessels in the tank deck would come aboard\nus, half the ships load what 30 – 40 sometimes 50 vehicles if they was\nsmall enough. Then we would storm into the beach do the last mile and the\nsurvivors those who managed to get back would go back and in two runs\nempty an LST and they would hot foot back to the UK to do another load.\n\n01:32:47\n\nNow when the hospital carrier was, when we were taking vehicles in on the\nsecond run, when we got half way through the process you’d see a column\nof ducks come out from the beach loaded with wounded, possibly fifteen to\ntwenty ducks and while waiting they would go around in a very orderly circle\nand as soon as the last vehicle came aboard us, raised the ramp we’d\nstorm into the shore and when we looked back we could see the LST\nlowering its ramp into the water the ducks drove straight up into the tank\ndeck everyman had a label on him describing his wounds and his needs\nand someone decided on priorities and they were operated on, on their way\nback some of them on their way back to the UK.\n\n01:33:40\n\nOne of my sergeants, sergeant Shepard terrible shrapnel wounds in his\nback, multiple wounds in his back. Like the rest of us he left about 11\no’clock on the night of the 5th and he was back in Netley Hospital 2 o’clock\nearly morning on June the 7th having done the return trip in under 30 hours\nnow that’s how they looked after the wounded. So you can well imagine\nquite often men said to me somebody’s looking after them, we don’t know\nwhat’s happening ashore, but really in the army you get used to a certain\namount of chaos, but here was order and it made a tremendous difference\nto morale.\n\n** Start of Film 4\n\n01:34:31\n\nWhat was it like on D-Day seeing the number of casualties, but also\nwatching those young men going ashore?\n\n\n\n\n01:34:41\n\nWell for me it has been said that the officers were the lucky ones because\nthey had something else to worry about and you can imagine was I worried,\nI was responsible for fifteen of these things and I wanted it to go well. In\nNorway thinking about myself and not very well trained I was so frightened I\nfelt ill, but I didn’t have the same feeling in Normandy. There were\nfrightening occasions I got a shell split in the middle of my forehead, it bleed\na lot, but I had a field dressing an awful yellow it was when it stopped\nbleeding I took that off, and carried on. Any lower I would have lost an eye\nany bigger… it was a splinter from a mortar shell.\n\n01:35:33\n\nWhen the mortar shells landed on the shore not in the sand, when they\nlanded in the sand they go straight up, but when they landed on the shore\non the hard concrete bags of concrete put there the splinters went\neverywhere, but it didn’t put me out of action. I was concerned that as\nmany Rhinos as possible would get off and do a second run. Now three of\nmine… these beach defences those pit props each with a tela mine or mine\nshell on top. Sappers had gone in earlier and made a path through these\npit props 100 foot wide just over twice as wide as a Rhino, and so we would\ngo in we had to land only between jig red and king green, couldn’t land\nanywhere else because the mines weren’t cleared.\n\n01:36:43\n\nIt was worrying because I wanted everyone to get off a float, off a float there\nwas commander Haywood Longsdale senior officer ferry control and I had\nthe biggest vessels in this fleet by far, so I had everything I wanted from\nhim. Ashore there would be a beach major who would give my men orders,\nwhich LST to go to because I couldn’t be everywhere at once and that was\ndone. Three of my Rhinos actually sat on mines, which evidentially come\nunstuck from these pit props in the preceding months and were buried in\nthe sand and they sat on them and they went off.\n\n01:37:26\n\nSo on each occasion we lost possibly a dozen of our 180 steel boxes and\nthere were casualties of course, but we had 160 odd to keep us afloat, the\noutside strings were held by those hedgehogs you often see so we lost a bit\nof buoyancy there, but we reckoned on putting the vehicles ashore in 2 foot\n6 of water and the photographs show them travelling ashore with certainly\nthat amount of free ward. So people were concerned about keeping busy,\nwe were told to expect smoke to be laid at twilight time when it was\nconsidered planes would have the advantage and I knew that smoke, like\nfog whatever our Rhinos hit would sink because a very sharp steel corners.\nWe’d left our mark on LCTs in Southampton water more than once while we\nwere preparing. So the orders were when they lay smoke, stop engines\nunless your very close to the shore and wait for it to clear.\n\n\n\n\n01:38:49\n\nNow one of my Rhinos actually stopped and while he was waiting for the\nsmoke to clear he drifted in front of the beach net and he motored back in\nthe dark and put his Rhino in, in one of these cleared lanes and the first\nvehicle down the ramp hit a mine, under the sand. So he managed to\nwithdraw and come back in alongside and he was rubbing alongside the pit\nprops that remained and I’ve never known a tela mine fall of one of these,\nthey were so securely made fast. Now he happened to have a brigadier\naboard so his number rank and name was taken and he was the only man\nin the company to get a mention in dispatches on D-Day.\n\n01:39:51\n\nWe were told if we could last 4 days and be still at half strength we would\nhave earned all our wages since enlistment and we were there well 12 out\nof my 15 carried on until the end of September, but 9 Rhinos I’d turned into\na floating pier so other landing craft of the ferry fleet wouldn’t need to go\nonto the beach, they could come along side my floating pier, each one with\na hole in the middle.\n\n01:40:22\n\nTed so you were there for longer than expected, what was it like\nseeing so many casualties coming back, did you have a chance… how\nmuch of a chance did you have to think about your own mortality and\nsafety?\n\n01:40:36\n\nWell I must say I was so concerned about keeping the beach major\nsatisfied and my goodness he needed some… two of my Rhinos didn’t get\noff a float for a second run D-Day because they were damaged and senior\nofficer ferry control was pleased, actually one of my Rhinos went adrift on\nthe way… broke adrift because It was very rough just of St Catherine’s\nPoint. The skipper put the crew aboard and they came back into the Solent\nimagine going up a one way street all the traffic coming out of the Solent\nand there going the wrong way, but we still carried on and when LSTs could\nbeach when the beach was no longer under fire the used to go in on the\nebb tide wait for the tide to drop, and so you see pictures of them sort of\nstranded and they didn’t need us.\n\n01:41:34\n\nSo we then were kept busy loading cargo out of the Liberty ships, cargo\nships. The advantage of a Rhino was when we were alongside we could\nplum three holds so Stevedore groups Royal Engineers again port\noperating groups would be used to unload a cargo onto our Rhinos we had\nNAFFI stores all kinds of things were loaded onto a Rhino they’d be brought\ninto Mulberry Harbour because that was going then. They would be\nbrought in about 2 hours after high water, they would dry out and crawler\ncranes would come out and load them up into lorries and driving onto the\nbeach.\n\n\n\n\n01:42:22\n\nThe great gale lasted on 4 days and all my craft, Thames barges and Rhino\nferries they all finished up ashore luckily on one of them finished up on the\ncliffs at Arromanche so although they were unsinkable Rhino 28 simply\nbashed herself to pieces being bashed against the cliffs and so she was\nsplit up into seven units here and twenty units there and her cargo of\nartillery was lost over the side.\n\n** Start of Film 5\n\n01:42:59\n\nSo at the end of September Antwerp, Ostend were free so they didn’t want\nus in Mulberry anymore so we moved up to Ostend and within a few days I\nwas told that someone in war office had discovered that more men were\nactually shot with rifle fire or machine gun, more men were drowned than\nwere shot. So it seemed that chief… the chief engineer 2 nd army brigadier\nCampbell knowing that there was lots of canals and rivers ahead in Holland\nand Germany thought it might be a good idea to have a river man to advise\non what was laughingly called ‘the opposed crossing of water obstacles’\nand because I was a river man, them not knowing I was just a 5th year\napprentice I was sent to assist chief engineer 2nd army.\n\n01:44:02\n\nFortunately… most fortunately the Dutch state waterways the\n“Rijkswaterstaat” must have been asked also if they had a Dutch civil\nengineer a real expert a degree man who would be willing to join us and\none such was liberated in Nijmegen and his name was Constan Lombrexon\none of the bravest men I ever worked with because he knew that when he\nand I were in the forward areas no man’s land, spying out the land and\nreconnaissance that if we’d been captured I would have been made a\nprisoner, but he would have been shot because he was Dutch and no doubt\nthey would have tortured him first because he knew so much, he knew what\nwas going to happen.\n\n01:44:55\n\nSo we worked together on planning the crossing of rivers now the first big\nriver what worried us was the River Maas. We were across the River Maas\nnear maastricht near a place called Borgharen, there was a bridge there\nand it was in constant use, but particularly at night, there was nothing else\nfor a hundred miles downstream, that was in either German hands or in no\nman’s land. So the whole of that river with four of five lochs on it all the way\ndown, loch… weir gates were unattended. Now what happened with weir\nthat were left unattended all that time from October to February when we\ncrossed was that the water went over the top of the gates scoured out the\nearth.\n\n\n\n\n01:46:00\n\nConstan Lombrexon… lieutenant Lombrexon when we were waiting to\ncapture the city of s-Hertogenbosch said that there was some secret…\nthere was some maps that had been hidden from the Germans there in the\noffice of the “Rijkswaterstaat” and he wanted to go and collect these maps\nbecause they contained all the spot heights all the heights of dykes and\nsurrounding ground defiantly what we need for crossing a river where the\nwater level was effected by rain fall. Now the brigadier wouldn’t let him go\nthat close, so I was sent.\n\n01:46:38\n\nSo I waited for their office to be cleared and s-Hertogenbosch was… began\nto be liberated on the 27th of October. So I went in, collected these maps\nand a few hours after I left quite a number of people were killed with\nGerman shelling and our shelling too. So Constan was delighted with our\nmaps and they came in very useful because when we were about to cross\nthe Maas at the end of January, all through January was snow cover. At\nthe end of January the brigadier asked us how wide will the river be at\nGennep our crossing place on February the 10th. Now fortunately the thaw\nstarted and the rains were coming and with his vast knowledge of Dutch\nwaterways he said well this river, which is now 200 meters across will be\n1200 meters. Now that’s over three quarters of a mile long and the\nbrigadier knowing how good he was technically sappers at Mook the\nnearest place downstream in our hands will be told to build 80 foot floating\nspans of bailey until told to stop, so that happened\n\n01:48:09\n\nThe assault took place on the 14th and 15th of February and by then the\nriver surly was right up and over the flood plain and the bridge that was built\nwas in fact 1222 meters long.\n\n01:48:29\n\nI lost a good friend in major Jack Locket who was shot on The Rhine\ncrossing and I was ordered to take over his company, bring them back after\nVE day. Bring them back to London we sailed our fleet of barges and tugs\nback to Surrey docks stayed there and waited and got the company ready\nto go out to Burma. Now traditionally the OC should be the last one to have\nembarkation leave, and I happen to be on embarkation leave when they\ndropped the atom bomb and I was still on leave on VJ Day. So my move to\nBurma was cancelled, much to my relief and I sort of wound the company\ndown.\n\n01:49:20\n\nWas sent to Marchwood as marine and IWT superintendent very very posh\ntitle and I was demobed there and when that happened I’d been in the army\n6 years and 7 months. So altogether you could say I was particularly lucky\nto be wanted, be at the right place at the right time, you can’t beat it.\n\n01:49:49\n\nYou’ve seen a lot of historic incidents and also some horrific\ncasualties, looking back on your time in the army how do you reflect\non it, with sadness or mixed emotion?\n\n\n\n\n01:50:05\n\nWell what was sad what you don’t see on film on the news is men lying\nthere, there not all in one piece, they just do not show men with bad injuries\noccasionally you see men that have been burned in tanks, I’ve seen them\nsince, but you don’t get the really horrifying injuries. They were quickly\ncovered and removed, but in the first few hours it was pretty lively. There’s\na special noise that a bullet makes when it ricochet it’s a buzzing noise and\nyou can imagine that one sort of tearing a nasty hole in you, but you\npressed on and I’m happy to say that it the minds of most men the fact that\nif you were hit you’d be on your way home straight away was a jolly good\nfeeling to think someone’s looking after them, I know I’ve said this before,\nbut it’s the thought that stays with me. Now well getting on a bit there are\nonly two of us left Ducky Bates 93 now, the only man awarded in the\ncompany for his work on D-Day.\n\n01:51:39\n\nSo its regret to think that so many men had to die, it was on the whole\npretty well organised it was brilliant for someone to decide to have a fleet of\nferry craft. It fooled the Germans and it worked because it was lovely to go\na ground and the beaches were there in view ahead of you a hundred two\nhundred three hundred yards away. So that’s a memory and since as a\nfreeman of the waterman’s company I’ve met up with my colleagues who\nwere apprentices in 1939 and 40 and I say there’s just two of us left out of\n308, men just 2 of us! And I consider myself very lucky indeed so there you\nhave it.\n\n** Start of Film 6\n\n01:52:38\n\nNorway I was 20 and I was sure I would never get to 21 now that’s… I\nwas… I felt ill with fear and wondered if anyone else felt as bad as I did\nbecause we were all hiding it, I don’t know how they felt but I know how I\nfelt. But I was really too busy on D-Day it’s the truth, scared of course from\ntime to time, but not simply terrified as I had been in Norway because it was\na very sad place no success no success at all… and that’s it’s a little bit of\nsuccess and adrenaline flowing of course. Yes I never felt quite like that\nagain. Of course the army training was also responsible you feel… you\ndon’t behave I mean Sappers, I mean you’re not in a brigade of Guards and\nso we apprentices, we had different ranks and different responsibilities, but\nthere’s none of this… instant automatic obedience.\n\n01:54:03\n\nOne of my sergeants, sergeant Maxwell I needed a Rhino in a hurry in an\nemergency, went round they got 7 days growth, they hadn’t been ashore\nand I got there we haven’t seen an officer since we got here, did you stop\nworking… “No” that’s why you aint seen a bloody officer. You see he said\n“well right do this job and you can stay ashore for 4 days” oh no they don’t\nwant to stop ashore for 4 days, tin treacle pudding or ice cream, which we\nhadn’t seen for 4 years or white bread, Americans, coffee on tap, individual\npackets of cornflakes with maple syrup… oh my goodness compo ration no\nlet’s stay afloat. Very well then you’ve earned it so they stayed afloat. Half\nthe LSTs were yanks… lovely… lovely.\n\n\n\n01:55:08\n\nYou were one of the first people… did you enjoy the American\ncompany because actually most people that I’ve spoken who were in\nthe military had a dislike of the Americans and the way they did… the\nway they ran their military?\n\n01:55:19\n\nWell yes I had a dislike, but when I was with the 2nd army I learnt to trust\nthem because on the Rhine for instance they were… they were across the\nRhine further upstream so we knew one meter rise in the last 24 hours in\nthe 9th US army sector at a certain place would mean at Xanten where we\nwere going to cross and Wesel and Rees where perhaps a metre rise there\nwould mean half a metre here or a metre rise somewhere else would mean\ntwo metres here you see. So we relied on their information and it was very\nvery good so each day I had to tell the brig Constan worked it all out, but in\ntime…\n\n01:56:12\n\nYou’d have a graph to say well in La Meuse (Maas) for instance 20\ncentimetres rise at Namur will 3 days later mean a 1 metre rise at\nBorgharen I can’t remember the details but that kind of information. So we\ncould say the Borgharen you could imagine if you don’t get any rain the\nbridge goes down down and your float your bits like that, this bit is the half\nfloating bay ( is demonstrating this as he’s talking) so they go down down\ndown eventually these two corners touch and so you had to stop the bridge,\ndismantle this lower the bank seat and bring it down again. So on doubtful\ndays you had to tell the brig its safe.\n\n01:57:07\n\nDownstream at Roermond the Germans had charted the weir gates, the\nloch and weir… the nearest loch and weir downstream now if they only had\na Constan Lombrexon working for them they’d of said a we’ll keep all the\ngates in and when there’s no rain for a period we’ll be holding all water and\nthen we’ll blow up the gates and our water would drop. So in those days\npresuming the Germans would know how to do this because it made good\nsense we would say if they blow up the weir at L???? today our bridge\nwould collapse. Now one day we had a report the people at Borgharen to\nthe north a very loud explosion during the night so Constan and I said well\nthey wouldn’t have blown up the bridge.\n\n01:58:07\n\nNow the next day I was supposed to fly in an Austa to spot the flooding so I\nsaid to the pilot would you be prepared a little bit of ground mist to go\ntowards L???? and I can see it in the distance I’ll know if they’ve blown it\nup. My delight yeah it was absolutely in ruins so I was the first man in the\nBritish army to know that L???? had been bombed also that they bombed it\nat the wrong time because the river was in flood and the brigadier was\ndelighted no longer did our…the safety of Borgharen bridge be determined\nby the Germans at L???? last year I went back for the first time and I got\npictures of myself by the brand new gates that they built there.\n\n01:58:53\n\nEnd of Films\n\n", "label": []}
