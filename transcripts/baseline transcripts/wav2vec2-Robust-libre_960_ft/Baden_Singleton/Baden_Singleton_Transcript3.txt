the word quite a lot especially after the invasion of sicily before that it was biota bit hairy we used to creep through between sicily and malta at night time you know and get through the other side same coming back well you had a contact what happened aboard what that normally it was flashed to pretend leader who who then either now sent somebody one of the quicker boats or am he would disappear but he didn't usually leave station he was he was the one in charge you've just had to watch on you know the seaman as take radar skipper on the bridge signalman you know just just the watch but it didn't take long again as you didn't undress you're out soon as that went you were up but if one of those you got so tired fall on a for off i've because i've maybe had a couple hours to go after the dogs before i'm on watch i've just laid me gas mask down on a gun platform and i've slept there you can you can sleep anyway if you're so tired you read i i've slept standing up on the bridge late leaning on the bridge with my glasses the classes up to my eyes and my legs have gone i didn't know i was going to sleep you know it wasn't intentional but i have i fell asleep or we couldn't carry a lot of fresh food am bread we had for two maybe three days maximum we would run out of fresh revenge and stuff so we only finished on with tins in food eggs seemed to last longer than most but flour the coke made bread they would make bread now have you ever eat shady cake that's what i bred like because it flower is full of weevils and you you just ignored it actually and you had your your pudding on your plate or so you know served and you learn don't turn it over never turn it over cause the waves are all gone to the bottle and my you at you see you do you and we didn't have like an apes sweep out we all we had was the dome underneath the aztecs sweep that was our sweep we we were looking for a subs you now show that they didn't get but as as the war went on it was left to italians and the italians aren't very brave i don't know where i'm allowed to say this am they they're not fighters you could tell back through the war they did change size to a they thought was winning you see and i think this is why we got away with it when i arrived out there that they'd sort of more or less given up so that we we didn't have a great deal of trouble the one of our points was the turner point am jerry had a f air base there so once again we used to arrange we went through there at night i mean they would know were there but there's no use them try and her over the aircraft at night since you left alexandria and joined the convoy and you would then be sweeping throughout oh yes yes and if you got a contact then usual drill would be for you to pass that information to corvettes or other vessels that were more came in the ship with the speed so really you're your depth charges were really a last resort more or less that they were there if we could drop deep enough to get out of the way yes i mean maxime mat witalking maximum twelve knots isn't very fast when those things are going to go off we did we did get going back with a small convoy we did get a a a pain you see and so and we're we on our own i forget what we are as going to riches us and he he dropped his pattern no and still there so back again and to what one first one is the drop is shallow too shallow and we we bent the plate in where we had to the pumps work and all to and the thing was it wasn't a sub anyway the shabby sub lieutenant hadn't ordered the charge and this was a wreck we were we pretend a wreck i mean anyone's choice really it's just the fact he hadn't made the chance of if if it was metal it was a wreck oh normally they charted you see the somebody had to chat and get to charge some together but like that particular time it wasn't my man or an automatically saw as a sub sitting there he wasn't moving so we had a go but all in autumn your personal experiences were generally in the immediate aftermath of the pedestal convoy ya ya ya as i say it did quiet down a lot we got there when it was quieter because mall because malta was relieved there was no need to stop convoys you see what i mean you could you could go i if i suppose if they'd been about and they show you now let go that they would have done but then there was no point to it there was no need but we still had to escort and you you were on the wulborough and in june forty four when the invasion of europe took place and what did you hear about that was that in any way changed very little very literal and it was a long way away you know we didn't get much news and we did get the news that the war was finished it came over the rates radio operator and of course the ship's company knew it before the skipper
