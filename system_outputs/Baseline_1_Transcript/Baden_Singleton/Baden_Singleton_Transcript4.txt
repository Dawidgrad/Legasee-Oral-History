the most action i saw was on the onrobio that was the action i saw by the time they had gone into sicily which was and when that was the action we did on the rome by the time that was well under way then really speaking it was a matter of form escort and so the winter walberg we didn't naturally she much at all did it become almost a bit too routine you were no as the operators were no statute watched if you were on watch you were watch you didn't you didn't relax you did when the wall finished you know we were bringing convoy down from a jim down to alex and half way down and you see ships for lights on you know it was there was something at quite and then the next convoy up we met the italian navy going towards alex a complete italian navy was going in to alex and we on a return trip as she always went in short of port of short food fuel and we couldn't get anything they were shown in the italian navy were an awful job to get what we wanted we weren't happy again did you stay together put him up as a crew throughout your time on romeo and then walborogh and how many of the nature from romeo actually ended up on walborough none none so you will see it all over the place who went into prometheus barracks and oh i fiddled about there i got fed up i don't like barracks all that much and there's one session they were asking for volunteers they didn't say what for and not a nobody i mean you don't do you don't volunteer but then they said if we don't get any volunteers we're going to just pick and that will mean married men will go so that stirred us youngsters and we volunteered i think if i were five ten ten and twelve i've i've a funny fine but twelve of us they wanted and the first thing we went up into alex into a gent tailors and they said pick what you want and who you can misonowwent to our mind what have we done and then we went from there we next day i think just basic kit cake shirts with these save shirts in our pack and got to hype nobody knew what we were we were hungry we were tired we we were given a tent nothing else just a tent and eventually they did come along with a bully beef sandwich and a mug of each which was very good and course the night is going on and we were tired we got down to it and nobody woke in the morning so we missed breakfast but they did once again came along with a bacon sandwich and a mug of tea and eventually we got down to it harbor and we went on a m l this was about evening time and luckily i managed to get hold of a bottle of brandy we sort of went round and we were deck cargo we got down below were on deck and is all took us to famagusta cypress truck over the mountains and actually we stopped at the top and there was a place on top where you could get drenched brandy again and we couldn't understand why the driver wouldn't let us give him a drink but we did on the way the other side you were looking straight down you know really way up and i shall we realize what he didn't want to drink sharp corners and it wasn't a roadway it was a track we finished up the other side in the indian camp and we didn't mind anyway indians killed this goat and we were given some of the meat we had to keep out the way because our shadows mustn't fall on the goat or they couldn't eat it if tainted and they gave us this meat we had one of these cauldron things and some coal and a shovel that was it apart from our own bully bully cans and cutleryand we sorted out as meat into the pot with the vegetables that we had given us and now we had nothing to stir it with only the shovel wiped it on the grass and on top all his hair floating on the top why we were uncover hungry i'll tell you that it got scraped off and then when it went in your billy can scrape a bit more off but didn't we enjoy that stew we did really did you know it was beautiful you know you have these things anyway we went ashore one night there and there was a fleet to anchor off a latino their men came ashore and we're in the bar and somebody must have said something wrong i've no idea what happened a fight broke over you have you ever seen on television fights where chair is flung and goes through the drum and things like that chairs flying bottles flying it was one of the boat's as absolute truth it was what a fight i i got away with it i was in the middle but i i got away with a lot of em felicia anyway the pickets were called and they separated us one on one side we're on the other truck back to camp and they didn't even give us time for breakfast next morning to a truck and a for a washed disheveled you know a blood or in the face or do i we got on this destroyer i once again you i say people going pass and they look at us and the way you end a m or i don't how long out we then were transferred to a great schooner it took us to one of the dog takes islands castratin quite close to the coast and we were there to man these schooners five crew and us and a leading seaman you see but we never did we never did whoever sent us there changed their minds or maybe the war developed i don't know but we never did we stayed on this island even that wasn't good because there was no no cook house or food there was nowhere reared you you fend for yourself and you scratched what you could the marlborough was the best ship she received a wonderful ship to sail on his part was that partly as a consequence of the the other men's the crew you your shipmates the people you serve to all the thing yes the ship itself and and the company you know the first lieutenant was a great chap and skipper was wonderful the thing you remember most is a comradeship you know you your mate as your mate and the rule naval patrol service did you feel that you were a very special little band of pirates oh yes and still do yes yes we we we were the only branch of the navy that could wear that badge no other branch in the navy can wear that in our work we're quite proud of it actually when i was in lost when we were being demobbed i signed on to stay in but then just after that i got married and i signed off we had the choice you could do it then i've seen so many dear john letters there was no way i was going to be married and in the service you can't blame the women you can't blame the men i mean a marriage is to be together isn't it so if you're away from home say three four years things happen you had to it but didn't it affect people i've seen it you know on and you see it on the smaller ships so much more than on a big one and the personalities of that changed completely you know nice good humoured easy going people her nature changed completely it was quite sad
