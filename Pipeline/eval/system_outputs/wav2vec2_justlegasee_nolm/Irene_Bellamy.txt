MY NAME IS IRENE BELLOMY R JUST WHERE ERE YOU FROM I WAS FROM BRISTOL FROM THE FISH BONDS AREA WHERE I WAS BORN AND I WENT TO SCHOOL IN BRISTOL AND STARTED MY WORK AFTER SCHOOL IN BRISTOL HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN WAR BROKE OUT WELL I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN NINETEEN SO I WAS TWENTY WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE FOR YOU IN BRISTOL IMAN WHAT WHAT HAPPENED ME A BIT ABOUT YOUR SCHOOLLING ANANJUST LIFE IN BRITTAN SO I UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE I ORIGINALLY WENT TO A SMALL PRIVATE SCHOOL A THEN WENT TO KOLSTON FROM THERE ND BRISTOL ITSELF I FOUND RATHER DULL YOU NO IT WAS ALL PUBS AND CHURCHES THAT'S HOW IT SEEMED TO ME THEY WERET THE FUN THINGS THAT THERE ARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY U MOST OF OUR TIME EITHER GOING TO FREE TIME GOING TO THE CINOA OR PLAYING SOME KIND OF GAMES ON I BELONGED TO YOU KNO VARIOUS HOCKY TEAMS AND TENNIS CLUBS DDDURING THE WAR OF COURSE WE WORKED VERY LONG HOURS AT AGHT SO AT YOU WEREN'T LOOKING FOR MUCH LEISURE FUN AN I MOVED BECAUSE OF THE BRISTOL BLITZ DURING THAT TIME I WAS PUT BY THE FIRM THEY DIDN'T WANT US IN THE DANGER OF CENTRA OF BRISTOL AND SO ON SO THEY TOOK OVER A COTTAGE IN SHIPS IN SODBERRY AND I LIVED IN SHIPS IN SODBURRY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THAT WAS QUITE GOOD FUN ACTUALLY THE SORT OF VILLAGE LIFE LOTS GOING ON BUT I'D ALWAYS HAD A END TO GO INTO THE NAVY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT MAINLY BECAUSE I HAD FRIENDS WHO HAD JOINED THE SERVICES WAS IT WRENS OVER ANY OTHER SERVICE YE I DIDN'T WANT TO JOIN DO YOU MEAN ENOUGH OR TS RNO NOMY PARTICULAR FRIEND WENT INTO THE WA AND SHE HAD A VERY INTERESTING TIME S OUT IN WASHING TON WORKING FOR THE NOT NAVAL THE AIRFORCE THE WREN WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE YES LIKE THE UNIFORM TO JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YATE AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE ANDTHE WORK AND STUFF WELL AS SECRETARY CHIEF DESIGNER IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS A QUESTION OF DOING TYPING HE WOULD DICTATE HIS DESIGN REPORTS BECAUSE HIT ALL HAD TO GO UP TO THE AIR MINISTRY FOR APPROVAL BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR AN ORDER FOR THESE PLANES OF COURSE AND IT WAS TYPING ALL THESE SHEETS OF DESCRIPTION OF THESE PLANES AND THAT HE WAS A VERY UNDISCIPLINED MAN IN AT HE LEFT EVERYTHING TO THE LAST MINUTE SO ONE WAS WORKING QUITE LATE AT NIGHT VERY OFTEN TO GET IT DONE TO THE DEAD LINE THAT THE MINISTRY HAD SET S HIS NAME BAZIL HENDERSON AND HE DESIGNED A SMALL PLANE CALLED TWHAT DOES THEY CALL IT THE HENDY IT WAS A BREAKDOWN OF HIS NAME ASLHEN IT'LL COME TO ME BUT IT WAS ROUND ABOUT THE TIME THERE WAS ANOTHER CHAP DESIGNING THOSE SMALL PLANES I CAN'T THINK OF HIS NAME NOW BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THAT WAR WAS COMING UM REALLY NO I MEAN TO SAY THE BOYS THAT WE USED TO MEET AND MIX WITH WERE MOSTLY AIRFORCE TYPES OR GOTIG INTERESTED IN THE AIRFORCE AND WE KNEW IT WAS THE FIVE O ONE SQUADRON AT PILTON THAT MOST OF THEM FLEW WITH AND WE KNEW AT TIMES TT FROM THEIR CONVERSATION THAT THINGS WERE GETTING VERY NEAR UT NOT REALLY NOYOU KNOW WE WEREN'T PUTTING UP THE BARRICADES OR ANYTHING WABOUT THE OUTBREAK OF WAR DO YOU REMEMBER THAT I DO AND WE WERE ACTUALLY ON FILTON AIRODROME THAT SUNDAY WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED IT WATCHING THESE LADS IN THEIR PLANES TAKING OFF PURELY FOR EXERCISE MDID THINGS CHANGE IN BRISTOL WHEN WAR BROKE OUT WHAT WAS THE CHANGE DO YOU REMEMBER I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY BECAUSE MOST OF MY LIFE WAS SPENT BETWEEN FISH PONDS AND YATS YOU KNOW I VERY RARELY WENT THE OTHER WAY TOWARDS TOWN IND DIDN'T REALLY GET ANY FEELING OF WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE EVEN YOU KNOW I READ NOW ABOUT SOME OF THE GHASTLY THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBING U KNOWTHE LOT OF LIFE BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME DIRECTLY MY PARENTS HAD A SHOP IN FISHBONDS AND THEY STILL KEPT GOING IN A QUIET SORT OF WAY DID YOU SEE THE BLITS COULD YOU SE WERE YOU INWERE YOU IN A WHEN ITA YES I WAS IN THE IDE AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FIRM MOVED US TO LIVE IN T SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BUSINESS OF TRAVELLING BUT DID HAVE A DAYLIGHT RAID IN YATE AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC THEY SENT A SINGLE PLANE M SA WE WERE ALL WORKING AWAY QUITE HAPPILY IND THE AIR RAID SIRUN WENT ND I WAS BEING TAUGHT HOW TO PLAY BRIDGE BY THE FRIEND WHO WENT INTO THE AIRFORCE AND UM TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE AIRAY TIR BECAUSE WE NEVER HAD ANYTHING AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A MOST ALMIGHTY EXPLOSION D THE WHOLE BUILDING SHOOK AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED A SINGLE PLANE HAD COME IN APPARENTLY IT CAME IN FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTHERN FRANCE AREA WHERE THE GERMANS HAD AIRPORTS AND HAD FLOWN UP THE BRISTOL CHANNEL SOMEWHERE NORTH OF GLOUSTER PICKED UP THE RAILWAY LINE AND YTE RUNS ALONG THE RAILWAY LINE IF YOU KNOW THE BUILDING AND FLEW DOWN AND DROPPD THIS TRIP OF BOMBS ALONG THE FACTORY FORTUNATELY A COUPLE OF THEM DID GO OFF BU I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SEEING A DEAD BODY BECAUSE I KNEW MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FACTORY BECAUSE OF WHO I WAS WORKING FOR AD ONE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOUSE IN CHIPPING SODBERRY WAS A WOMAN CALLED SISTER HOBBS WHO BECAME QUITE WELL KNOWN FOR THE WORK SHE DID IN THAT BLITZ AND SHE JUST CAUGHT HOLD OF ME AND SHE SAID COME ON WE'VE GOT TO GO UP TO THE BRICK FACTORY SHE SAID TO IDENTIFY THESE PEOPLE WHO'V BEEN KILLED ANYOU KNOW I WAS TAKEN WHAT AS I IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE TWENTY TWO AT TWENTY TWO TO SEE ALL THESE DISINTEGRATED BODIES AND I HADN'T SEEN A DEAD BODY BEFORE AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC WAS THAT DO YOU THINK OF CATALIST OF THINKING I WANTED TO JOIN AD BECOME A WRENNER NO I DON'T THINK SO THAT WAS QUIETLY SIMMERING AWAY I THINK THE CATALIST IN THE END WAS WHEN MY BOSS MOVED HE WENT TO A FIRM WHICH AGAIN YOU MAY KNOW OF BOOZY AND HAWKS HE WASN'T A MUSICIAN ORHE HADN'T MADE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE JOB THEY DID ORIGINALLY THEY WERE MAKING SPARE PARTS FOR SOME OF OUR GUN TURRETS AND FOUND THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD DESIGN WHAT THEY WANTED AD THEY GOT HIM THEY HAD HUNTED HIM AND WHEN HE LEFT I WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH A PERSON WHO GOT THE JOB AND I THOUGHT I WANT TO MOVE BUT I HAD TO WORK QUITE HARD TO GET INTO THE WRENS BECAUSE OF COURSE I WAS IN A RESERVED CPATION I WAS GOING TO ASK WAS ITI ASSUMED IT WAS A RESERVED OCCUPATION SO YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCEDURE TO GET OUT AND THERE WRTTHE WRENS WEREN'T OPEN FOR RECRUITMENTS ANYHOW AT THAT TIME WE WERE BEING UM DRAWN I SUPPOSE IS THE WORD FOR BY WAR ARTIST A MAN CALLED LEOPOLD FREDMAN I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RUN TO EARTH SINCE I'VE TRIED BECAUSE HE DID LIKE A MUREL OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THE FACTORY AD IT WENT TO THE NATIONAL WAT'S THE ONE IN TRAFALGAR NO NASHAL ARK GALLERY IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE I WAS SITTING OKNO WHILE HE WAS DRAWING ME AND TALKING TO HIM AND I SAID I WANTED TO JOIN THE WRNS AND THE PROBLEM WAS THERE WERE NO VACANCIES AND I WAS IN E RESERVED OCCUPAS SO HE GAVE ME THE NAME OF A WOMAN AGAIN I' FORGOTTEN HER NAME BUT SHE WAS THE HEAD OF THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR IN LONDON SO I'D GO OFF TO LONDON TO SEE THIS WOMAN AND SHE SHE TOLD ME SORT OF INSIDE SECRET THAT I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN FAIRLY SOON BECAUSE THE WRENS WERE EXPANDING AND THEY EXPANDED VERY RAPIDLY AND I GOT IN VERY EASILY THEN BUT I HAD TO WAIT UNTILL THE DOORWAS OPEN BECAUSE THE LORDS OF THE ADMIRALTY DIDN'T WANT WOMEN RELUCTANTLY TOOK THEM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR BUT OIT WAS A MAN'S SERVICE IT WASN'T FOR WOMEN BRILLIANTSO WHAT WAS THE PROCESS THEN FROM TRANSITIONING FROM BEING A SECRETARY IN A TO BECOMING A WREN WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF IT I REMEMBER HAVING MY PAPERS OBEING SENT TO LEADS BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY SUDDENLY EXPANDED THEY HAD TO OPEN NEW TRAINING DEPOTS I WAS IN MY EARLY TWENTIES AND I HAD WHAT THEY CALL A WHITE PAPER WHICH WAS A RECOMMENDATION FOR A COMMISSION AS SOON AS YOU WERE INTERVIEWED ORIGINALLY YOU KNO MOST GIRLS HAVE TO WAIT AND WORK A WHILE BUT

SENT TO CHERRY PICKING ORCHARDS AND THAT WAS AMAZING BECAUSE ALL THE LANES ROADS ALL ROUND OF KENT SORT OF AREA GOING DOWN TO THE COAST WAS FULL OF ARMY VEHICLES AND MEN WAITING AND YOU KNEW THAT THEY

CAN YOU RMEMBER HOW YOU FELT WHEN YOU FOUND OUT YOU BEGAN FOLLOWING THE EXPEDITION UTI WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I FELT THAT I AM STILL THAT MY NAVAL LIFE WAS ANYTHING BUT NAVY YOU KNOW TE AUBECAUSE I HAD GGREAT IDEAS OF BEING BOAT CREW AS I SAID GOING TO SEA WITH THA MAIL WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE INLAND AS IT WERE BUT ONCE I GOT USED TO IT AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN ADVENTURE AS WELL IN GOING OVER DID YOU SAIL TO FRANCE WE WENT OER YOU KNOW THEAS UM TK THE TROOPS OVER INWE WENT OV BECAUSE ACTUALLY WHEN IT CAME TO IT THE WAR THAT THE ARMY WAS ALMOST IN BURLIN BY THEN SO THEY FELT IT WAS SAFE TO PUT THE GIRLS OVER WE WENT ACROSS TO A LITTLE TOWN IN NORMANDY CALLED GRONVIEL OTHE WERE DUCKS WE CALLED THEM YUNOW G KK THSE LIKE LANDING CRAFT AND I WAS TERRIBLY SICK II SAY IT PROVED TO ME I WASN'T A SAILOR TERTE WEE THE OF THE DAY THAT YOU WENT ON THE LANDING CRAS TO FRANCE GOING BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THE STORYAND WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF YOU KNOW THAT DAY WHERE DID YOU SAIL FROM AND WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LIKE CEN YO CAN YOU REMEMBER THE WEATHER WASN'T TOO GOOD HENCE THE FACT T IOBWIOUS I SUPPOSE I THINK THERE WERE PROBABLY NEARLY BETWEEN FIFTY AND HUNDRED OF US GOING NOT ONLY WRNS BUT OTER WE WENT FROM ONE OF THE LITTLE PORTS THEY WEREN'T REALLY PORTS THATWERE AROUND THE BUWLE RIVER TTHAT WAY WE WERE EXCITED WE DIYOU HAD ALL SORTS OF IMAGINATIONS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN CROSSING THE CHANNEL AT MIGHT SINK OOD WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO SWIM FAR ENOUGH AA THE WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WATER WHEN WE GOT THE OTHER SIDE LIKE YOU SEE THE MEN YOURE KNO TRAILING OUT WITH ALL THEIR STUFF THROUGH WATER THEY MANAGED TO BEACH US SO WE WERE QUITE DRY WHEN WE GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE YOU KNO THE FRENCH ACTUALLY IN NORMANDY WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING THEY WERE VERY PLEASED TO SEE US THEY WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN MY VIEW TO THE ONES WE MET IN PARIS WAS IT OBVIOUSLY WATORN YES SYOU KNOW TH BECAUSE IT WOULD BE AFTER D DAY OF COURSE WE WEREN'T ACROSS SO THINGS WERE STILL PRETTY BROKEN OUALL THE SORTOF FRONT LINE HOUSES AND THINGS WERE ALL BASHED ABOUT BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN BOMBARDED OF COURSE FROM THE SEA AND GRANTVILLE WHAT WAS THE SET UP THERE ANDYOU'RE STILL IN A WAR WAR ZONE BASICALLY AREN'T YOU IT WAS A WAR ZONE WELL IT WAS JUST A SORT OF GETTING OFF POINT FOR MOVING PEOPLE ON BEHIND THE ARMY I THINK IT WAS FELT TO BE A REASONABLE PLACE TO START MOVING CAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF EQUIPMENTT AS WELL WE DIDN'T BUT THE ARMY THE AIRFORCE AND THE NAVY FOR THAT MATTER THEY ALL HAD EQUIPMENT TO MOVE UP WITH US UM AND I THINK GRANVILLE PROBABLY TAT A LITTLE TOWN WAS CONSIDERED YOU KNO THEY HAD GOOD ROAD NOT GOOD BUT THE TRANSPORT SITUATION MOVING STUFF WAS REASONABLE BUT VERY BASIC LIVING CONDITIONS YOU KNOW WE HAD NO RUNNING WATER OR WE HAD SORT OF THINGS LIKE YOUR TRIPOD WITH CANVAS BAGS IN THEM WHICH WERE USEDLESS WASHING MACHIWELL FOR WASHING WHAT UX WAS THERE BUTIT WAS LIKE CAPING REALLY FROM A LIVING POINT OF VIEW AD VERY LITTLE WORK WE HAD AT THAT TIME WERE YOU JUST WRITING OR DID YOU HAVE TELLIPRINTERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WAS THERE ANY TECHNOLOGYOH YESTHERE WAS A LOT BUT NOT IN THE GROUP I WAS WITH DON'T NWACTUALLY THE PEOPLE TO GO OVER WITH THE COMMUNICATORS THE TELEPHONE OPERATORS AND SO ON AND OF COURSE THEY WERE STILL THE ENGINEERS WERE STILL FITTING UP FIELD EQUIPMENT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND THERE WERE A LOT OF WRENS IN THAT GROUP TREMENDOUS LUMBER FROM GRANVIELD YOU KNOW THEY FOUND THAT THE WORK THEY WANTED ME TO DO WAS MORE CENTERED BACK IN LONDON SO I WAS SHIP BACKD TO THAN LONDON TO WAIT UNTIL THEY'D PREPARED WHAT WE NEEDED OI HAD TO HELP T DO THAT AND WE WENT THEN TO PARIS BUT I WENT FROM LONDON FRO ENGLAND'S LANE THAT WAS TO PARIS ON MY OWN AND THEN I REALLY WAS I'D NOT BEEN ANYWHERE ON MY OWN BEFORE I ASE MET WHEN I GOT TO THE GARGENOR BECAUSE I WENT OVER ON THE TRAIN BY ANOTHER WRN WHO'D BEEN OVER THEN I WAS BILLETED AND WORKED IN A CHATAU IN UM IT'S A SUBURB OF PARIS ANYHOW I WORKED THERE FOR A VERY SHORT TIME AND THEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP WERE FOLLOWING ON BEHIND THE ARMY AND WE WENT FROM PARIS TO FRANKFORT I DIDN'T ENJOY FRANKFORT VERY MUCH BECAUSE THERE WASN'T MUCH TO DO BY NOW OU MOST OF THE PLANNING HAD BEEN DONE ALIFE BECAME RATHER SORT OF THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY POINT IN WHAT WE WERE DOING WE DONE IT ALL SO IT WAS A BIT OF A PLAYGROUND WAS THIS AT THE END OF IT WAS THIS AFTER THE WAR YEH LOUDMY SAY THE UM THAT HAD ENTERED BERLIN DWE WERE BACK IN PARIS SO IT WAS OF JUST AS THE WAR WAS ENDING THE FIRST A YES IT HAD ENDED BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME IN PARIS WERE THE FASHION WAS OWMOST BEAUTIFUL HATS MADE OUT OF CELEFANE PAPER YOU KNOWSWEET PAPERS AND THINGS THE WOMEN HAD MADE THEY SEEMED UNTOUCHED BY THE WAR IN PARIS MUCH LIKE US I DON'T THINK I THINK THE GERMANS HAD GIVEN THEM QUITE A GOOD TIME YOU W ADMIRAL PARRI THEN AT THIS POINT NO I MET ADMIRAL PARRE WHEN I GOT TO PARIS E WITHDRAWING AS A PERSON VERY QUIET NOYOU DIDN'T REALLY FEEL NO HE COULD HIT ANYBODY STHEY COULD KILL ANYBODY BUT OR EVEN DISCIPLINE ANYBODY HE WAS ALWAYS VERY GENTLE ANDVERY NICE TO WORK FOR BUT VERY CLEVER OF COURSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WANTED JUST DESCRIBE OF WORKING RELATIONSHIP WHAT YOU DID FOR HIM AND THE PURPOSE OF YOUR BEING THERE WAS JUMA YOU SEE MOST OF THE RA HE REALLY WOULD HAVE COMMUNICATED CAPTAIN OWIN MOST OF WHAT HE WANTED BECAUSE HE'D BE OFF DOING SOMETHING ELSE BUT SO TAT CAPTAIN OWIN WAS REALLY THE PERSON WHO WAS GIVING ME WORK WHEN THERE WAS WORK TO BE DONE BUT AADMIRAL PARRY CERTAINLY WAS VERY APPROACHABLE AND HE MIXED WITH US THERE WAS NO SORT OF OFFICERS AND OTHERS EVERYBODY MIXED AND E HE AS A DIFFICULT MAN TO DESCRIBE REALLY ATHAT YOU NICELY DESCRIBE DOWN THERE YEA WHEN WE WERE IN BERLIN DODO YOU KNOW BERLIN AT ALL IN THE LAKES THE VANSA THE LAKES THAT ARE ON THE OUTSKIRTS WHEN WE WERE LIVING IN WHAT HAD BEEN THE JAPANESE EMBASSY IN BERLIN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOUSE IT WAS IN THAT DISTRICT WHERE THE LAKES WERE BUT I ALWAYS SAID THE VANSLAKES ATHEY WOULD FREEZE OVER IN THE WINTER BECAUSE WE HAD A WINTER THERE KNO THE ADMIRAL WOULD ARRANGE SCATING PARTIES AND YOU KNOW O COURSE THE ICE THERE SO THICK BECAUSE ITWAS SO COLD AYOU COULD HAVE BARBIQUS ON THE ICE OU KNW THAT'S WHERE LIFE BECAME A BIT SUPERFICIAL LATTERLY WHEN THERE WASN'T MUCH WORK TO DO OU OW YOU REALLY FELT YOU SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE DOING SOME WORK DIDYOU GET FROM PARIS INTO FRANKFORT THEN ARE ON RAILWAYS WERE YOU IN VEHICLES OR NAVAL JEEPS MOST OF THE TRAVELLING WAS IT THE ONOLY THING WHEN I WENT FROM FRANKFORT TO BURLIN I HAD BEEN HOME ON LEAVE WHEN I GOT BACK IT WAS TO FIND THAT W BUT THEY COULDN'T NOTIFY ME THEY COULDN'T GET HOLD OF ME TO LET ME KNOW THAT THE MAIN PARTY HAD GONE ON TO BURLIN AND WHEN I GOT BACK TO FRANKFORT I HAD TO GO AND REPORT TO ONE OF THE ARMY OFFICERS TO GET TRANSPORT AND WHEN I GOT THERE I FOUND A MESSAGE TO SAY THAT GENERAL IZENHOWRS HAD MARRIED ONE OF OUR WRENS I KNEW THEY WERE VERY FRIENDLY BEFORE I WENT AND HE LET THEM HAVE HIS HOUSE IN NEAR FRANKFORT FOR THEIR HONEYMOON AND THEY WERE BOTH DUE BACK IN BURLIN AND THEY WOULD GIVE ME A LIFT SO I WENT BREEZING UP THE AUTOBAN FROM FRANKFORT TO BERLIN AND GENERAL IZEDEN HOUSE CAR AN WHAT WAS BURLIN LIKE WHAT WAS POST WAR BURLING ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED THAT REALLY DID SHAKE ME WHEN I SAW IT OU OW THER WAS ALMOST EVERY BUILDING WE SAW WAS DEDESTROYED THERE WERE THESE AND THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY OLD WOMEN BUT THEY LOOKED OLD BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL HUMCHED UP IN DARK CLOTHES WITH WHEEL BARROWS CLEARING THE STREETS ADWORKING SO HARD AND LITTLE FOOD OUTHEY WERE WORKING WITH VERY LITTLE STRENGTH I MUST GIVE THE GERMAN THE DU THEY DID WORK HARD TO GET BERLIN BACK DID YOU GO TO THE BRANDONBON GAE OR THE BOE TELL ME ABOUT SOME ING THATWELL THAT AGAIN WAS MORE LIKE A TORIST TRIP YOU I'D BEEN TRYING TO THINK WHAT OUR OFFICE IN BERLIN WAS LIKE DIN'T YOU BY THEN OF COURSE IT WAS THE CONTROL COMMISSION AND I CAN'T VISUALIZE IT AT ALL IT'S AN ABSOLUTE BLANK IN MY MEMORY I CAN REMEMBER THE WRENERY THE JAPANESE EMBASSY AND I CAN REMEMBER GOING ON THE TRAM FROM THERE TO THE OFFICE BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OFFICE AT ALL ANDBECAUSE I WAS THERE FOR NEARLY A YEAR BUT U WE WENT TO SE THE BUNKER ON WERE HITLER WAS KILLED AND THAT WAS STILL INO NO PRETTY ROUGH STATE YOU KNOW BITS OF FURNITURE WERE STILL THERE IT HADN'T BEEN TID UD UP WHAT WAS YOUR SENTIMENT TOWARDS THE GERMANS AT THE TIME WELL IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE THEM VERY HELPFUL BUT THEN YOU KNOW I QUITE LIKED THEM BUT O COURSE THEY HAD A LOT TO GAIN FROM US IN THE WAY OF FOOD AND SO ON THE RUSSIANS OF COURSE WERE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE STORY GOES THAT THE RUSSIAN ARMY THAT TOOK BURLIN THEY PULLED THEM BACK THEY REPLACED THEM WITH A SORT OF THIRD LINE WHO WERE MONGOLINS D THEY WERE PRETTY ROUGH ON ONE OCCASION COMING HOME FROM THE OFFICE A COUPLE THEY USED TO DRINK AN AWFUL LOTOF ANY BOODS THATHE AT ODOF COUPLE OF VERY DRUK RUSSIANS STAD WE WERE WALKING HOME FROM THE OFFICE IN BURLIN TO OUR DIGS D THEY STARTED GETTING THEIR GUNS OUT AN SHOOTING ALL OVER THE PLACE WE HAD TO JUMP IN A HEDGE AFTER THAT OUT OF THEIR WAY AND AFTER THAT THEY PUT A FAIRLY STRONG MARINE PRESENCE ONA SORT OF GUARD OAND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO TRAVEL ON OUR OWN SO YOU WERE PRETTY OK ON TRANSPORT IF WE GOT THE TRAM HOME ITS IF YOU STARTED WALKING WE HAD UM GMAN COOK IN THE WRENNERY HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO BE PLEASANT TO US BUT HE WASE BECAUSE OF COURSE HE USED TO COLLECT OUR USED TEA BAGS AND TAKE THEM HOME ANDHE KNEW THAT IF HE DIDN'T YOU KNOW TREAT US ALL PROPERLY HE'D GET TAKEN OFF AND WE'D GET SOMEHONE ELSE AND HE'D LOSE OUT ON HIS BITS AND PIECES HE WAS GETTING AN WE ALSO HAD AN INTERESTING MAID FRANCESCA WHO WAS GERMAN AT ALL JEWISH AND SHE HAD HAD A VERY BAD TIME SHE HAD LEGITIMATELY BECAE WELL I SAYL YOU LEGITIMATELIT WAS HER BOYFRIEND NOT A GERMAN OR A RUSSIAN PREGNANT AND SHE HAD THIS BABY IN A CELLAR WHICH SHE WAS HIDING FROM BECAUSE THE GERMANS WERE STILL LOOKING FOR JEWS EVEN AFTER THE WAR ND ANYHOW IT WAS A RUSSIAN SOLDIER WHO ACTUALLY HELPED HER HAVE HER BABY IN THIS CELLA AND YOU KNOW WHO REALLY RESCUED HER COURSE THE BRITISH WE WERE IN THE BRITISH REGION OF COURSE BUT FRANCESCA USED TO
