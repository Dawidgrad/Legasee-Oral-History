EM MY NAME IS IREEN BELEMY I WE JUST ERM WHERE ARE YOU FROM I WAS FROM BRISTOL FROM THE FISHPONDS AREA ERWHERE I WAS BORN AND I WENT TO SCHOOL IN BRISTOL AND STARTED MY WORK AFTER SCHOOL IN BRISTOL HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN WAR BROKE OUT UM WELL I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN NINETEEN SO I WAS TWENTY WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE FOR YOU IN BRISTOL I MEAN WA WHAT HAPPEN JUSTELL ME A BIT ABOUT YOUR SCHOOLING AN AND NJUS LIFE IN BRISTALNL SO I UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE YEAH UM I ORIGINALLY WENT TO A SMALL PRIVATE SCHOOL UM AND THEN WENT TO KOLSTON FROM THERE AND EM BRISTOLL ITSELF I FOUND RATHER DULL YOU KNOW IT WAS ALL PUBS AND CHURCHES THAT'S HOW IT SEEMED TO ME YOU KNOW THERE WEREN'T U THE FUND THINGS TAT THERE ARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO DERY URM WE SPENT MOST OF OUR TIME EITHER GOING TO THE OUR FREE TIME GOING TO THE CINOA M OR PLAYING SOME KIND OF GAMES YOU KNOW I BELONGED TO YOU KNOW VARIOUS HOCKEY TEAMS AND TENNIS CLUBS UM AND UM DURING DURING THE WAR UM OF COURSE WE WORKED VERY LONG HOURS UM AT YATE SO THATYOU WEREN'T LOOKING FOR OU MUCH LEISURE FUN AND I MOVED BECAUSE OF THE BRISTOL BLITZ DURING THAT TIME URM I WAS PUT BY THE FIRM THEY DIDN'T WANT US IN THE DANGER OF CENTRE OF BRISTOL AND SO ON AND SO THEY TOOK OVER A COTTAGE IN CHIPPING SODBURY AND I LIVED IN CHIPPING SODBURY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS URAND THAT WAS QUITE GOOD FUN ACTUALLY WA A SORT OF VILLAGE LIFE WAT'S GOING ON BUT I'D ALWAYS HAD A YEND TO GO INTO THE NAVY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT ERMAINLY BECAUSE I HAD FRIENDS WHO HAD EJOINED THE SERVICES UM WAS IT WAS IT WRNS OVER ANY OTHER SERVICE YEAH I DIDN'T WANT TO JOIN DO YOU MEAN ER IN FOR ATS OR NO NO NO MY PARTICULAR FRIEND WENT INTO THE A AND SHE HAD A VERY INTERESTING TIME AS OUT IN WASHINGTON ER WORKING FOR THE NOT NAVA THE AIRFORCE THE WREN WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE YES YES LIKE THE UNIFORM TOO YEAH JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YAT AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE AND THEN THE WORKANG STUFF ERM WELL ERM AS SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF DESIGNER IN THE BEGINNING UM IT WAS A QUESTION OF DOING RM TYPING HE WOULD DICTATE HIS DESIGN RM REPORTS BECAUSE IT ALL HAD TO GO UP TO THE AIR MINISTRY FOR APPROVAL ER BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR URM AN ORDER FOR THESE PLANES OF COURSE AND IT WAS TYPING ALL THESE SHEETS OF DESCRIPTION OF THESE PLANES EM AND THAT MEAN TO SAY HE WAS A VERY UNDISCIPLINED MAN IN TAT HE LEFT EVERYTHING TO THE LAST MINUTE SO ONE WAS WORKING QUITE LATE AT NIGHT VERY OFTEN TO GET IT DONE TO THE DEADLINE THAT THE MINISTRY HAD SET THAT WAS HIS NAME BASIL HENDERSON AND HE DESIGNED A SMALL PLANE CALLED THE UM WHAT DID THEY CALL IT ERM THE HENDY E IT WAS A BREAKDOWN OF HIS NAME IT WAS BASIL HENUM IT'LL COME TO ME BUT IT WAS UM ROUND ABOUT THE TIME THAT THERE WAS UM ANOTHER CHAP DESIGNING THOSE SMALL PLANES M I CAN'T THINK OF HIS NAME NOW BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THE WAR WAS COMING UM NOT REALLY NO I MEAN TO SAY THE BOYS THAT WE USED TO MEET AND MIX WITH ER WERE MOSTLY ERM AIRFORCE TYPES OR GONG INTERESTED IN THE AIRFORCE AND WE KNEW TIT WAS THE FIVE O ONE SQUADRON TE AT FILTOMN M THAT MOST OF THEM FLEW WITH UM AND WE KNEW AT TIMES A FROM THEIR CONVERSATION THAT THINGS WERE GETTING VERY NEAR BUT ERM NOT REALLY NO NOT YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T PUTTING UP THE BARRICADES OR ANYTHING WHAT ABOUT THE OUTBREAK OF WAR DO YOU REMEMBER THAT I DO WE WERE ACTUALLY ON FILTON AERODROME THEN THAT SUNDAY WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED IT WATCHING THESE LADS IN THEIR PLANES TAKING OFF PURELY FOR EXERCISE SO I MEAN DID THINGS CHANGE IN BRISTOL WHEN WAR BROKE OUT WHAT WAS THE CHANGE DO YOU REMEMBER I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY BECAUSE MOST OF MY LIFE WAS SPENT BETWEEN FISH PONDS AND YATS YOU KNOW I VERY RARELY WENT THE OTHER WAY TOWARDS TOWN AND DIDN'T REALLY GET ANY FEELING OF WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE EM EVEN YOU KNOW I READ NOW ABOUT SOME OF THE GHASTLY THINGS THATA HAPPENED IN THE BOMBING YOU KNOW THE LOSS OF LIFE M BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME DIRECTLY UM MY PARENTS HAD A SHOP IN FISH PONDS AND THEY STILL KEPT GOING YOU KNOW IN A QUIET SORT OF WAY DID YOU SEE THE BLETZ DID YOU SEE WERE YOU IN WERE YOU IN YATE WHEN IT HA YES I WAS IN YA YE AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FIRM MOVED US TO LIVE IN YATE SO A WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BUSINESS OF TRAVELLING UM BUT WE DID HAVE A DAYLIGHT RAID IN IN YATE AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC UM T THEY SENT A SINGLE PLANE I MN I S WE WERE ALL WORKING AWAY QUITE HAPPILY IN THE AIR RAID SIREN WENT AND E I WAS BEING TAUGHT HOW TO PLAY BRIDGE BY THE FRIEND WHO WENT INTO THE AIR FORCE AND ERM WE DIDN'T TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE ARRA TIRIN BECAUSE WE'D NEVER HAD ANYTHING AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS THE MOST ALMIGHTY EXPLOSION AND THE WHOLE BUILDING SHOOK AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED A SINGLE PLANE HAD COME N APPARENTLY IT CAME IN FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTHERN FRANCE AREA WHERE THE GERMANS HAD EM AIRPORTS AND YAD FLOWN UP THE BRISTOL CHANNEL O SOMEWHERE NORTH OF GLOUCESTER PICKED UP THE RAILWAY LINE AND YATE RUNS ALONG THE RAILWAY LINE IF YOU KNOW THE BUILDING AND FLEW DOWN AND DROPPED THIS STRIP OF BOMBS ALONG THE FACTORY FORTUNATELY A COUPLE OF THEM DIDN GO OFF ATD I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SEEING A DEAD BODY BECAUSE I KNEW MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FACTORY BECAUSE OF WHO I WAS WORKING FOR AND ONE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOUSE IN CHIPPINGSOBERY WAS A WOMAN CALLED SISTER HOBBS WHO BECAME QUITE WELL KNOWN FOR THE WORK SHE DID IN THAT LIZ AND SHE JUST GOGT HOLD OF ME AND SHE SAID COME ON WE'VE GOT TO GO UP TO THE BRICK FACTORY SHE SAID TO IDENTIFY THESE PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN KILLED AND YOU KNOW I WAS TAKEN WHAT LWAS I IT WAS NINETEEN WFORTY ONE OT LIK TWENTY TWO AT TWENTY TWO TO SEE ALL THESE DISINTEGRATED BODIES AND I HADN'T SEEN A DEAD BODY BEFORE AND THAT WAS VERY TRAMATIC YEAH WAS THAT DO YOU THINK A CATALIST OF THINKING I WANT TO JOIN AND BECOME A WREN NO I DON'T THINK SO NO NO THAT WAS QUIETLY SIMMERING AWAY AND I THINK THE CATALIST IN THE END WAS WHEN MY BOSS MOVED HE WENT TO A FIRM WHICH AGAIN YOU MAY KNOW OF BOOZI AN HAWKS THEY RM HE WASN'T A MUSICIAN OR HE HADN'T MADE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE JOB THEY DID ORIGINALLY THEY WERE MAKING SPARE PARTS FOR SOME OF OUR GUN TURRETS AND THEY ERM FOUND THA HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD DESIGN WHAT THEY WANTED AND RM THEY GOT HIM UM THEY HEAD HUNTED HIM AND WHEN HE LEFT I WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH A PERSON WHO GOT THE JOB AND I THOUGHT I WANT TO MOVE BUT I HAD TO WORK QUITE HARD TO GET INTO THE WRENS BECAUSE OF COURSE I WAS IN A RESERVED OCCUPATION I WAS GOING TO ASK WAS IT OVER S I ASSUMED IT WAS A RESERVED OCCUPATION SO YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCEDURE TO GET OUT YES AND THEY WEREN'T THE WRNS WEREN'T OPEN FOR RECRUITMENT ANYHOW AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE BEING URM ER DRAWN I SUPPOSE ITS THE WORD FOR THE BY WAR ARTIST A MAN CALLED LEOPOLD FREEDMAN WO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RUN TO EARTH SINCE I'VE TRIED BECAUSE HE DID A LIKE A MURAL OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THE FACTORY AND IT WENT TO THE UM NATIONAL ARWHAT'S THE ONE IN TRAFALGAR I LI NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE EM AND URM I WAS SITTING YOU KNOW WHILE HE WAS DRAWING ME AND TALKING TO HIM AND I SAID I WANTED TO JOIN THE WRNS AN THE PROBLEM WAS THERE WERE NO VACANCIES AND I WAS IN A RESERVED ORCIPIT SO HE GAVE ME THE NAME OF A WOMAN AGAIN I FORGOTTEN HER NAME BUT SHE WAS HEAD OF THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR IN LONDON SO ID GO OFF TO LONDON TO SEE THIS WOMAN AND SHE OED SHE TOLD ME THE SORT OF INSIDE SECRET THAT I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN FAIRLY SOON BECAUSE THE WRNS WERE EXPANDING AND THEY EXPANDED VERY RAPIDLY AND I GOT IN VERY EASILY THEN BUT I HAD TO WAIT UNTILL THE DOORS OPEN BECAUSE THE LORDS OF THE ADMIRALTY DIDN'T WANT WOMEN OKNOW THEY RELUCTANTLY TOOK THEM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR BUT YOU KNOW IT WAS A MAN SERVICE IT WASN'T FOR WOMEN BRILLIANT SO WHAT WAS THE PROCESS THEN FROM TRANSITIONING FROM BEING A SECRETARY IN Y TO BECOMING A WREN WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF IT YEAH I REMEMBER YOU KHAVING MY PAPERS AN BEING SENT TO LEEDS BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY SUDDENLY EXPANDED ER THEY HAD TO OPEN NEW TRAINING DEPOTS I WAS IN MY EARLY TWENTIES AND EM I HAD WHAT THEY CALL A WHITE PAPER EM WHICH WAS A RECOMMENDATION FOR A COMMISSION

FRANCE CAN YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU FELT WHEN YOU FOUND OUT YOU'D BE GOING FOLLOWING THE EXPEDITION O U I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I FELT THAT M I AM STILL THAT MY NAVAL LIFE WAS ANYTHING BUT NAVY YOU KNOW THOUGH T WAS BECAUSE I HAD GREAT GREAT IDEAS OF BEING BOATS CREW AS I SAID GOING TO SEA WITH A MAIL ERM SO I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE INLAND AS IT WER UM BUT ONCE I' GOT USED TO IT M AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN ADVENTURE AS WELL IN GOING OVER DID YOU SAIL TO FRANCE WE WENT O YOU KNOW THOSE ERM BOATS THEY TOOK THE TROOPS OVER INEWE WENT OVER BECAUSE ACTUALLY ERM WHEN IT CAME TO IT THE WAR WAS THAT THE ARMY WAS ALMOST IN BERLIN BY THEN SO THEY FELT IT WAS SAFE TO PUT THE GIRLS OVER EM U WE WENT ACROSS TO A LITTLE TOWN IN NORMANDY CALLED GRANVIL ON THE WERE DUCKS WE

PRETTY ERM BROKEN YOU KNOW ALL THE EM ER SORT OF FRONT LINE HOUSES AND THINGS WERE ALL BASHED ABOUT BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN BOMBARDED OF COURSE FROM THE SEA AND AND AND GRANDVILLE WHAT WAS THE SET UP THERE AND YOU KNOW YOUW'RE STILL IN A WAR WAR ZONE BASICALLY AREN'T YOT YEAH IT WAS A WAR ZONE WELL IT AS IT WAS JUST A SORT OF GETTING OFF POINT FOR MOVING PEOPLE ON BEHIND THE ARMY I THINK IT WAS FELT TO BE A REASONABLE PLACE TO START MOVING CAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF EQUIPMENT AS WELL WE DIDN'T BUT THE ARMY AND THE AIR FORCE AND THE NAVY FOR THAT MATTER TALL HAD EQUIPMENT TO MOVE UP WITH US ERM AND I THINK GRANVIL PROBABLY HAD AT A LITTLE TOWN WAS CONSIDERED YOU KNOW THEY HAD ERM GOOD NOT GOOD BUT THE TRANSPORT SITUATION MOVING STUFF WAS REASONABLE BUT VERY BASIC LIVING CONDITIONS YOU KNOW WE HAD NO WRUNNING WATER OR RM WE HAD SORT OF THINGS LIKE YOUR TRIPOD WITH CAMNVAS BANGS IN HE LOOK WE USELESS WASHING ERM MACHINE ERM WELL RM FOR WASHING WHAT EST WAS THERE M BU IT WAS LIKE CAMPING REALLY FROM A LIVING POINT OF VIEW AND VERY LITTLE WORK WE HAD AT THAT TIME AND WHAT WERE YOU JUST WRITING OR DID YOU HAVE TELYPRINTERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WAS THERE ANY TECHNOLOGY SO OH YES THERE WAS A LOT BUT NOT IN THE GROUP I WAS WITH YO KNOW E ACTUALLY THE FIRST PEOPLE TO GO OVER WETH THE COMMUNICATORS UM ETELEPHONE OPERATORS AND SO ON M AND OF COURSE THEY WERE STILL THE ENGINEERS WERE

PLANNING HAD BEEN DONE AND LIFE BECAME RATHER SORT OF THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY POINT IN WHAT WE WERE DOING WE DONE IT ALL YOU KNOW SO IT WAS A BIT OF A PLAYGROUND WAS THIS AT THE END OF IS THIS AFTER THE WAR YEAH I MEY SAY THE THE URM TROOPS THAT HAD ENTERED BERLIN URM AND WE WERE BACK IN PARIS SO IT WAS SORT OF JUST AS THE WAR WAS ENDING THE FIRST E YES IT HAD ENDED BECAUSE ONE OF THE

INTERESTING BECAUSE ERM I FOUND THEM VERY HELPFUL BUT THEN AND YOU KNOW I QUITE LIKED THEM M BUT COURSE HE THEY HAD A LOT TO GAIN FROM US IN THE WAY OF FOOD M AND SO ON UM THE RUSSIANS OF COURSE WERE THE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I THE STORY GOES THAT THE E MAIN RUSSIAN ARMY THAT TOOK BERLIN THEY PULLED THEM BACK AN THEY REPLACED THEM WITH TE SORT OF THIRD LINE O WERE MONGOLIANS AND THEY WERE PRETTY ROUGH AND ERM ON ONE OCCASION COMING HOME FROM THE OFFICE A COUPLE VERY THEY USED TO DRINK AN AWFUL LOT ANY BOOS THT THEY GET HOWEVER A COUPLE OF VERY DRUNK RUSSIANS STARTED WE WERE WALKING HOME FROM

THEY PUT A FAIRLY STRONG MARINE PRESENCE ON THEYOU KNOW A SORT OF GUARD ON THE AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO TRAVEL ON OUR OWN UM SO YOU WERE PRETTY OK ON TRANSPORT IF WE GOT THE TRAM HOME U ROAT SA AS YOU STARTED WALKING WE HAD ERM A GERMAN COOK IN THE WRENERY EM AND HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO BE PLEASANT TO US BUT HE WASE BECAUSE OF COURSE HE HE USED TO COLLECT OUR USED TEA BAGS AND TAKE THEM HOME

THE WORK UP UNTIL WE GOT TO BERLYN WAS REALLY QUITE INTERESTING ER BUT ONCE YOU KNOW THE FINAL STAMPS WERE BEING PUT ON THE DIVIDING OF THE CITY INTO REGIONS AND THINGS LIKE THE BREAKUP OF THE OF THE GERMAN NAVY ER THER REALLY WASN'T MUCH INTERESTING TO DO M AND I IT DID BECOME A SORT OF ALMOST A PLAYGROUND JUST TELL ME ABOUT VJ DAY YEAH WELL WE WERE IIN BERLIN WHEN VJ DAY WAS ANNOUNCED UN UM THEY SAID THERE WOULD BE A PARADE TOWARDS THE BRANDONDBERG GADE SO WE WENT HAD THE DAY OFF AND WENT DOWN TO SEA AND IT WAS A WONDERFUL DISPLAY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE END OF THE WAR AND EVERYBODY WAS A BIT
