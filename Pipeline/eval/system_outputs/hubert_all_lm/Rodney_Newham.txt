MY NAME IS RODNEY NEWNHAM AND I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN I HAD AN APPRENTICESHIP IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD AND FOR FIVE YEARS AND THEN I SERVED A TIME ON MOST OF THE SHIPS THAT CAME IN ON REPAIRING I WAS IN THE BOILER MAKING TRADE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THE BOILER ROOMS AND ENGINE ROOMS WERE THE ONES I WAS EMPLOYED IN AND I KNEW MORE ABOUT SHIPS AND SOME OF THE SAILORS KNEW BECAUSE I USED TO KNOW EVERY PART OF THE SHIPS EVEN DOWN INTO THE SHAFT THE SHAFT THAT GO THROUGH AND DRIVE THE PROPELLER AND AND ONE OF MY JOBS WAS TO PUT SAFETY AND SHIELDS OVER THE JOINTS OF THE SHAFT GOING THROUGH THE SHIP AND I KNEW MOST OF THE SHIPS AND WE WERE DIFFERENT THE ENGINE AND BOILER ROOMS MORE THAN ANYTHING AND THE AIR SUPPLIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN WE SAT IN EXAMS FOR ARTIFICER APPRENTICES OR DOCKYARD APPRENTICES AND AT THAT TIME I WANTED TO GO INTO THE NAVY BUT IN THAT AT THAT TIME THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT YOU IN THE ENGINE ROOM ARTIFICER IF YOU HAD GLASSES BECAUSE THE SHIPS IN THOSE DAYS A LOT OF STEAM COME FROM THE BOILERS SO YOU NEVER YOU COULDN'T DO IT SO I WENT THEN AS AN APPRENTICE IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD AND SERVED FIVE YEARS THAT WAS NINETEEN THIRTY SIX DAYS EVEN WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF THE DOCKYARD GATES CHILDREN WERE BEGGING IN BARE FEET FOR YOUR SANDWICHES THAT YOU HAD OVER AND YOU USED TO GIVE THEM TO THE CHILDREN WHO WERE THERE WAITING FOR THE DOCKYARD PEOPLE TO COME OUT SO THEY COULD GET THESE SANDWICHES IT DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE DOES IT BUT THAT'S TRUE YES I HAD A SISTER WHO WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD AND I HAD A BROTHER WHO WAS SEVEN YEARS YOUNGER AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM I NEVER KNEW I NEVER KNEW BUT MY SISTER SHE LIVED TO ABOUT EIGHTY THREE I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT WIN MY SISTER YES AND MY MY FATHER WAS A CHIEF ENGINE ROOM ARTIFICER IN A NAIVE HE DID HIS TWENTY TWO YEARS YOU KNOW AND AND MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS EIGHT SO I NEVER REALLY KNEW HER MOTHER'S LOVE AND CARE FROM THE AGE OF EIGHT NO SO I CAN'T SAY I HAD A HAPPY CHILDHOOD AS SUCH NOW HAVING A MOTHER'S CARE AND WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF YOUR EARLY APPRENTICESHIP IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD WHAT WERE YOU ACTUALLY WAS THERE A SENSE OF WAR I MEAN WERE YOU WAS IT WERE YOU BUILDING UP FOR WAR OR WAS IT JUST YOU KNOW A JOB FOR YOU AT THE TIME WELL IT WAS NINETEEN THIRTY SIX I WENT INTO THE DOCKYARD I WAS AN APPRENTICE FOR FIVE YEARS APPRENTICESHIP THIRTY SIX SO IN THAT TIME THE WAR BROKE OUT SHIRTY NINE IN IT THAT'S RIGHT AND SO I WAS SERVING THE APPRENTICESHIP ACTUALLY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT YES WELL IT WAS WHEN I FINISHED I WAS THEN A QUALIFIED BOILERMAKER WHICH WAS A HARD JOB HARD WORK SO I I DETERMINED AT THAT TIME I WOULDN'T STAY AS A BOILERMAKER SO I MADE PROGRESS IN THE TRADE I EVENTUALLY BECAME AN INSPECTOR OF TRADES IN IN THE DOCKYARD THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I RETIRED AS AN INSPECTOR OF TRADES THE APPRENTICESHIP OF A BOILERMAKER WAS A HARD JOB IT WAS A HEAVY HEAVY MATERIAL JOB YOU CAN IMAGINE THE BOILERS THEY WEREN'T MORE THAN THEY WERE WHAT WE USED TO CALL YARROW BOILERS AND CYLINDRICAL BOILERS MADE OF METAL ABOUT AN INCH THICK AND WE USED TO ROLL IT INTO SHAPE AND MIND YOU THEY WERE BIG THEY WERE UP TO THIRTY TON BECAUSE THE CRANES USED TO HAVE TO LIFT THAT YES IT WAS IT WAS A HEAVY HARD WORK BOILER MAKING WAS YES I KNOW OF A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED WHEN THAT ONE HE HAD A PLATE DROP FROM A CRANE I SLIPPED OUT OF THE GRIP AND FELL ON HIM AND KILLED THEM YES TERRIBLE AND EM AND I REMEMBER A MAN BEING KILLED ON THE THE CRANES USED TO GO UP AND DOWN ON RAILS LIFTING LIFTING THIRTY ODD TONE AND ONE MAN WAS CRUSHED UP ON THE LINE AND IT WAS IT WAS A NAVAL OFFICER WHO ACTUALLY WENT UP THERE UPPER STEPS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE STEPS WERE LOCKED SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULDN'T GET BUT HE WENT UP THERE TO RETRIEVE A BODY TO SEE IF HE COULD DO ANYTHING FOR A VERY BRAVE A NAVAL OFFICER LIEUTENANT HE WAS IT'S AS PLAIN AS IF IT WAS YESTERDAY YES YES I WAS AND IT WAS HARD SOMETHING I'M QUITE INTERESTED IN RODNEY IS OBVIOUSLY CHATHAM BECAME A VERY VERY BUSY DOCKYARD DURING THE WAR YES DID YOU NOTICE YOU KNOW DID YOU NOTICE TO TALK A BIT ABOUT THIS ESCALATION IN THE AMOUNT OF WORK IN TERMS OF PROVIDING FOR THE WAR EFFORT WELL THERE WAS A NUMBER OF VESSELS USED TO COME IN DAMAGE BECAUSE OF WAR AND THEY WOULD BE REPAIRED IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD AND AND WE USED TO DO MAKE GUN SHIELDS AND TORPEDO PLATFORMS THAT REVOLVE FOR THE TORPEDOES ON AND WE USED TO DO TO MAKE THOSE PLATFORMS TORPEDO TO BE FIRED FROM AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND GUN SHIELDS WE USED TO MAKE MADE OF EM BULLET PROOF METAL WHICH WAS VERY HARD TO WORK WITH YOU KNOW BEING HARD ON ANY OF THEM BECAME THE AROSE WAS A CRUISE I WORKED ON AND THE LONDON WAS ANOTHER CRUISER AND AND A NUMBER OF FRIGATES AND A MINE SWEEPERS AND THEN WHEN WE USED TO DO THE REFITS AND THAT WOULD MEAN STRIPPING OUT THE BOILER AND ENGINE ROOMS AND RENEWING A LOT OF THE STUFF AIR SUPPLY THROUGH THE VENTILATION AND TO THE ENGINE AND BOILER ROOMS THROUGH TURBO GENERATE THAT COLLECTED THE AIR AND DISTRIBUTE IT AROUND THE SHIP YES THAT WAS ALL THE ALUMINIUM TRUNKING WITH GRILLS ON THE END OF THE TRUNK YOU COULD ALTER TO DIFFERENT POSITIONS IN THE ENGINE AND BOILER ROOMS YES I USED TO MAKE THOSE GRILLS AND FIT THEM AND THINGS LIKE I REMEMBER THE GERMANS COMING OVER WITH QUITE A NUMBER OF THEM I REMEMBER THE AND THE ARITHUSA CRUISER OPEN OPENED FIRE ON THEM AND I THINK I THINK A LOT OF THE CRAFT ITALIANS I THINK CAME OVER BECAUSE IT WAS NOTICEABLE BUT THE GERMANS WOULD HAVE GONE ON BUT WHEN THE ARITHUSA OPENED FIRE ON THEM A LOT OF THESE PLANES CHANGED AND TURNED AROUND AND WENT BACK FROM WHERE THEY COME FROM YOU NEVER BELIEVE IT WOULD BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED YES THE GERMANS WOULD HAVE KEPT TIME AND WOULD HAVE ATTACKED THAT TARGET I THINK SOME OF THE OTHERS WERE ITALIANS YES BECAUSE WHERE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN IN A SHELTER STOOD UP AGAINST ONE OF THE WORKSHOP WALLS AND THAT WAS MY SHELTER AND WATCHED THE ARTS OPEN UP AND SHE WAS IN A DOCK AND SHE OPENED UP AND I STOOD THERE WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL OF THE WORKSHOP AND SAW THESE MEN ON THE ARIETHUSLA STRIPPED TO THE WAIST FIRING THE SHIP AND GETTING THE EMPTY SHELLS AND THROWING THEM ASIDE AND UNLOADING AGAIN AND FIRING THAT WAS ON THE ARIETHUSLA YES THEY WERE REALLY GOOD THEY WERE THEY REALLY REALLY TURNED PLANES AROUND AN EXPERIENCE YES BECAUSE I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DOWN IN A SHELTER AND I DIDN'T GO DOWN THERE YES I WAS GIVEN ONE TO GO TO IT WAS JUST A DUGOUT AND YOU WENT DOWN THE STEPS AND THAT WAS THERE BUT I WOULDN'T GO DOWN THE THING AND I STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL OF THE WORKSHOP YES NOT THAT I WAS BRAVE AT ALL JUST THAT I WOULDN'T GO DOWN THE SHELTER I'D RATHER TAKE THE CHANCE IN THE WAR WHEN YOU WEREN'T IN THE DOCKYARD OR WERE YOU LIVING IN THE DOCKYARD AS WELL NO I LIVED OUTSIDE OF THE DOCKYARD YES I LIVED IN GILLINGHAM ROAD FOR A TIME NEAR THE RAILWAY CROSSING YOU KNOW THAT PART OF GILLINGHAM I LIVED WITH MY FATHER THERE YES BECAUSE MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS AT BUT I WENT WITH MY DAD WE I THINK WE KNEW THAT WE WOULD PUT IT LIKE THIS WIN IN THE END YOU KNOW THAT WE WOULD BE THE VICTORS AS A NATION BECAUSE I THINK THE EFFORT EVERYBODY WAS BEHIND THE WAR EFFORT AS FAR AS I KNOW YES YES I SUPPOSE YOU AS YOU YOU WEREN'T PAID A LOT OF MONEY YOU YOU WERE SOME PEOPLE MADE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE OF THE WAR THAT BUT WE WERE NEVER LIKE THAT WE NEVER MADE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE OF THE WAR BEING ON AND IT WAS HARD WORK BUT GREAT BIG SLAB THAT I USED TO DO THINGS ON WITH A VICE AND HEAVY VICE ONE END OF IT AND I USED TO ROLL PLATES AND CYLINDERS OUT OF AN INCH THICK MATERIAL AND ERM USED TO WORK IN THE FURNACE AND PULL PULL RINGS OUT OF THE FURNACE AND ROUND THEM UP AND YOU USED TO HAVE TO HAVE AN ASBESTOS SHEET TO SHIELD YOU FROM THE HEAT THAT CAME OFF WHEN YOU PULLED IT OUT WITH RAKES ONTO A SLAB FROM THE FURNACE AND THE HEAT WAS SO GREAT THAT YOU USED TO HOLD THIS ASBESTOS SHEETS UP IN FRONT OF YOU TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE HEAT AS YOU ENDEAVOUR WITH LARGE LARGE HAMMERS TO SHAPE TO TO MAKE THEM INTO THE RIGHT SHAPE SOMETIMES THEY WEREN'T QUITE ROUND AND SO YOU HAD TO PUT DOGS ON THEM AND SHAPE THEM YOU JUST HAD ASBESTOS SHEETS TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE HEAT AND THE THING WAS THAT YOU AS YOU YOU MADE THINGS OUT OF SPEC SHEETS AND YOU JUST SAW IT UP AND ALL THE DUST YOU BREATHED IT ALL IN NO WONDER SO MANY MEN DIED OF ASBESTOSIS I HAD WHAT THEY CALL PLUG IN BOTH LUNGS WHICH I'VE GOT NOW BUT IT NEVER NEVER SOLIDIFIED MEN USED TO BREATHE IT AND IT WOULD GO SOLID IN THE LUNGS BUT I WAS FORTUNATE IN THE MINE DIDN'T
