yeah well my name is doug shelley right and my rating was able seaman right were you which port division were you i was chatham chatham port division all right doug why why did you go in the navy what was your thinking well i'll tell you why i went in my uncle was a chief on the jervis bay my brother was a chief and that's why when i volunteered i went to romford drill hall and in there i said to him right i want to join the navy the bloke said well you lucky there and that's what i done what year was that oh not till forty two where were you living and what was life like in the war for you er what civilian side or yes civilian side well i was only er well i was only about what seventeen and a half you know when i volunteered i wasn't eighteen and they didn't ask for a birth certificate because i couldn't i couldn't produce one majority of blokes done that at er romford drill hall so that's it i went in when i was about seventeen and a half and what was it like for you then going from being a a boy civilian to becoming a sailor that transition training etc well that that was entirely different weren't it i mean we were only lads you know but you know before before you well by the time you was in the navy within a year and a half two years you they made a man out of you believe you me you wasn't a boy any more where where did you go first i first went i my first erm i went to i done my training at hms glendower which is in wales and that's where i done my training and are there any stories from there that you remember well no only strangely enough it was in the winter time and we were all in bloody huts like that and of course in the morning bang bang bang' on your bloody door and of course the old chief was out there shouting out wakey wakey rise and shine the morning's fine it would scorch your eyes out there was about four foot of snow out there and that was it what were you what was your sort of training there was it square bashing and stuff yeah well we went through all that square bashing and physical training we used to go for about a six mile run every morning yeah on the old pti did you enjoy it all then oh i did yeah i loved it yeah couldn't couldn't have been better really and when you'd done your training up in wales then is that when you were assigned to a port division yeah then you're assigned i went to chatham you know where the cavalier is er and then i went through a gun recourse there cause i was a gunnery rating and then i was drafted you know on the russian convoys you see that was my first destroyer what do you remember of the chatham barracks are there any stories that you've got of your that you remember being in chatham well er i do know that there was er a guy now this is whether it's true or not who was in a chatham rating and he only came in for his for his pay a fortnight nobody could find him afterwards amazing isn't it what was what was discipline like down there well oh what was it like it was i'll tell you what that was well that was just as much as anything in the navy in chatham dockyard if you went on the weekend leave and you never got in there by half past seven you were booked that's it and when you went across the playground the square where you done your training you know you had to run double all the time not walk double you'd hear the gi double double double and off you went now in the morning when you fall in for the divisions right the working party this is you got the old po out there and he said who can ride a bike and you say ere yes and i thought to myself cor i'm alright here but you know what they done when when the guys in the white duck suits the gqs they shackled them one to you and took them down to the commander's reports and i thought well this is no good is it it's not riding a bike so i never volunteered any more and that was it and and how long were you there before you saw a draft with your name on it then er not long after i'd done me gun recourse i got drafted onto the milne you know for the russian convoys and where did you pick up the milne i picked well i had to go to scapa flow and i picked her up about half past two in the morning and i tell you i was bloody knackered because in those days there was well troops were going everywhere and i had to sleep and got up on the roof racks and slept in there until i got there but the strange thing about it was when we got on board right it was half past two in the morning it was me and a petty officer anyway slung me hammock and got in it and all of a sudden well i was so tired i didn't know what i see this bloody great rat about that size leapt across and i thought i'm too tired anyway in the morning they tried to book me for a slack hammock because you had to have your hammock stowed by half past six in the morning they'd call out measure up and stow and this po booked me me and the other one and i said look now do me a favour i said you're not very human are you he said no i'm you know i said no i said we didn't join until half past two in the morning i said give us a chance so he said alright alright fair enough so we were lucky there you were lucky yep we was lucky yeah yeah but half past two in the morning i had about three hours four hours you know sleep and that was it so what was it like then sort of after you've had this incident with the po what what was your sort of take of the milne what did you think well then you got back you got back to normal seaman's duties you know up on the upper deck and all the rest of it as an ab you're always up on top on the deck you know what was your first impressions of the of the milne then once you'd seen it well i you know i thought to myself cor it's er quite a nice boat you know what i mean yes i thought yeah lovely and of course when i first joined her as er a gun layer er an lrt er you know a cross gunner they couldn't put me in the turret so they put me on what they call ack ack which is a pom pom and i thought christ i don't know anything well anyway i was a loader i had belts of bloody ammo right over my shoulder loading them in to the you know the pom pom and of course when they go like that you know what they call a pom pom don't you well because it pom pom pom pom you know no they call it the er chicago piano she goes like that you know ferocious yeah how long were you in scapa and the milne before you sailed not all that long actually er we got our orders to pick up the convoy at loch ewe cause that's where they all waited for us and then off we went was milne a new ship or had it been yep yeah she was they built seven of them they were specifically built for arctic convoys because they had heated inside and heated torpedo tubes you know but when you looked at it you know any naval bloke would think it's a bloody cruiser but it wasn't it was a destroyer specially built and out of seven three got sunk yours was the only one that didn't well i'm a lucky man to be honest sometimes i wake up in the morning and think when they fired the torpedo at us it missed us by that but the rest got sunk did you know anything about the arctic convoys when you went up went up to milne no knew absolutely nothing about it at all so what was it like sailing out of scapa and heading up to iceland what do you remember of that well yeah it weren't too bad we went to reykjavik er to refuel and then we got attacked from above so that's when we had to open up you know but we were lucky enough to er beat it off and then head off did they come did you shoot the plane down sorry did you get the plane no no we didn't no no we er then we got further round and then we were attacked by the u boats and er and we got we got one we blew it out of the water what was that like for the crew well they were over the moon weren't they they would be wouldn't they if you sink a bloody u boat you you're lucky ain't you but course you know as you further went down and took the merchant ships into er kola inlet but that aside time in that little area was about twenty twenty seven u boats waiting for you and that's where they were taking them out they got they got all that sussed up cause their island on the way round down to russia that was a a u boat pen they used to operate out of there then they followed the convoy down into kola and then all the boats we were escorting the big er american liberty ships which were welded in three sections sometimes with the weight of the snow on it would split one of them and she would roll over but if that didn't get it then the u boats got em is this all on your first convoy this yeah on my first one yeah the very first one that was what name was that one oh god now you've got me oh christ i can't i can't there were so many you see when you went out you was pq when you come back you were qp they reversed the situation of the convoy numbers then there was of course ra and weren't there there were so many different convoy numbers yeah i can't did you go on some of the pq convoys yes i was on yeah i was on like p q eighteen which followed the seventeen which lost well out of thirty five ships there was only seven about seventeen arrived and you were on the p q eighteen yeah the following one yeah the following one yeah what was conditions like although you were a heated ship what were they like well normally er a destroyer's compliment during peace time was roughly about two hundred and thirty we had about two two hundred and fifty two hundred and sixty it was over complimented yeah there was hardly any room at all there was a grotty little bloody bathroom as such you know you had to do everything in there scrub your hammocks do your doby and do everything wash and shave and all sorts of things yeah just going back to the the u boat then were you on deck when you saw that did you see that go i was in me turret cos i was er er a gun layer in the turret but when they sent the deck charges out you see that's what blew it out of the water so you didn't you weren't able to see it because you're you were inside a turret well i couldn't see anything because i'm i'm in a bloody turret i can't get out cause they used to have to do four on four off four on four off right up the way through right the way down to er murmansk and what was it like you mentioned it was a chicago piano' but what was the just describe you're what you're doing in the turret and what you well i i was a feeder a loader giving them you know the belts of ammo but that wasn't where i should have been but cause the turrets were full up that was it but eventually i i wound up in the turret in b turret did you actually go ashore at murmansk wasn't allowed ashore nope wasn't allowed merchant seamen which is the strange thing about it when they got in to offload all their raw materials they had a rough time believe you me the russians didn't want to know them they just it was stalin that more or less paused them really there was a guy i mean as russian women went i mean well you were very lucky anyway this guy fell in love with her and she fell in love with him and anyway what happened was erm she stowed away on the ship and they found her then they sent her oh god poor woman they never did that was it she suffered what they sent her back they sent her back but they sent her out into siberia somewhere nasty and the poor bloke well that was it weren't it just tell me a bit about what you remember of going into kola then well well there's not a lot really you just steaming in there with the convoy you know well you weren't doing a lot of knots because with a big convoy you it it averages from seven fourteen knots a time slowly in there and once we we got em in there then we had to go and er wait for another one to fetch back go alongside the you know the dockyard and wait there til we got another one to escort back so there was an instance where you actually helped to rescue people were you on deck when that was going on yeah i was yeah i was on deck tell me about that well we just brought them in well half of them were well near enough bloody dead when you when you drop in the barents sea you only last about three to four minutes it's the coldest sea there is did you know that yeah that never mind about the atlantic you go through the atlantic and then into the barents sea and we had we were dressed up in we had seaman's jerseys we had overalls then we had a duffel coat then you had a harness with two red lights on port and starboard and if you dropped in there if you were lucky they'd you know harness on they'd fish you out if not you were frozen stiff and dead gone all merchant seamen who got torpedoed during the war their pay was stopped and they they were lucky if they were alive half of them they were frozen stiff gone and did was there ever any instance where your skipper actually stopped to help well only on er only on that occasion yeah so what do you remember of that occasion what was going on well i only roughly er you know when when that was er the merchant ships was walloped and we went to assist them and pull them in that was about it so what were you doing to help well i was a seaman i was just pulling them in there half of them were bloody dead anyway they weren't alive they were frozen stiff soaked in oil and god knows what what was that like for you as a young man do you remember it well it was terrible terrible and absolutely ghastly absolutely ghastly have you ever well i don't like saying this have you ever seen a dead person frozen what is said not frozen we've we've had blokes frozen stiff on look out you know dead as a dodo even with you know like that gone that's how cold it was what happens when somebody dies on the ship what's the process well normally they're they're buried at sea they're sown up into the hammock and er passed over the side what do you remember of the the seas just talk about were there any were you caught in any storms sorry were you ever caught in any big storms i should think so pq seventeen was one of the worst storms i will verify that that they've ever had on those runs you know you've got waves thirty foot high winds that well he had a lot of damage on his ship what was it what was did you have good sea legs what do you remember of being caught in a big sea did you ever feel like it was going to tip over or anything well yeah there was always that point you didn't know whether you were going to be whoop can you remember how you felt when you you'd done p q eight t you'd seen all this carnage around you you're in murmansk and then you know you've got to return i mean how do you feel at this point can you remember well it's a question of well you don't feel all that good obviously but erm you're there to do a job and you get on with it and that's it cause we were young and strong and fit and you know nothing really seemed to bother you all that much you just got on what you had to do well you you obviously did but were there people on board who didn't did you ever see anyone crack up well yeah there was one or two that erm you know er got a bit erm well it frightened the bloody life out of them to be honest well it would do anybody as a as a young young boy you know cause they er they weren't all old they were all youngsters coming in some before the war and some ho's what happens next remember just talk to me a bit about what else you what is said well we picked up another convoy and brought them back to loch ewe and then we had to wait for another one to take back down again were there any stand out memories how many convoys did you do well it's difficult to say really there was roughly on you got onto at least i done nine months on that you've got to do six months to qualify for the atlantic star so were there any other experiences that you can talk about what on the convoy duties well not particularly no i've more or less covered most of it erm i really felt sorry for the merchant navy guys because erm the majority of their liberty boats were getting blown out of the water half of them never arrived anyway and then when they got there they were treated like huh you know nobody you know who are you ' sort of thing and yet they've just done eighteen hundred miles from you know loch ewe right the way round down to murmansk or any other you know archangel or polyarny or somewhere like that did you ever get ashore in russia did you ever go to any of the other bases yeah i did yeah but never got ashore weren't allowed all we done was sentry duty alongside with the russians they were marching up and down we were marching up and down and that was it but you couldn't get ashore if you did you you were in trouble they called that breaking out of ship' and breaking back in again' and then they really lashed you up then especially in those conditions it's bad enough in peace time but wartime is the worst part of it cause if you er whatever happened during the war like if you fell asleep or anything on watch you you could be shot for that really that's how bad it was and you mentioned about people who froze to death on watch that was on the milne yeah yeah that's right was that anyone you knew sorry did you know that person well they they were the crew on board our ship yeah see on board the ship all your you know you're all able seamen you've got all different branches and they're all living in different you know messes so you don't know everybody on the ship you you know you might have more or less seen them once sort of thing and that's it but like us seaman have to go up on the upper deck you know and on look out like that you know and do our stint up there you well in that it's said like these guys that they had their sea boot stockings and their sea boots on and their sea boot stockings were frozen to their bloody legs they had to have to take them off and then their boots as well but that's how cold it was well you can see by that can't you did you ever have any downtime i mean was there ever any entertainment on board or anything like that well you you made your own entertainment didn't you you had you had sod's opera and all things and the lads got dressed up yeah you made your own entertainment and what did the milne do after the arctic where did she go afterwards when i left the milne she actually er went as a training ship and then after that she was sold to the polish navy and they bought all our because they were bloody good ships without a doubt and where did you go when you left the milne when i left the milne i i'll tell you when it was erm it was just before dday and i come home have me leave then i was drafted out to australia to golden hind which was a dispersal camp then from the golden hind i was in there what roughly about two weeks then i was drafted back to a later destroyer a battle class they were later ones and that was it then we went all round australia and all over the place are there any stories over there that you want to share er well yeah we went er i don't know if you er you know queensland northern australia well there's two places called port mackay and townsville we went into townsville they're like one offs towns galloped down the bloody street on horse they were and we were the first british destroyer ever to enter there and my god everybody on that ship got entertained by the people that lived there there wasn't one bloke left on that ship who was allowed to go ashore so we all dressed in our suits our whites i went with the er chief fire officer and he said to me right ho mate he said get your bloody clobber off he said cause you know well it was about well oh well the temperature was well you can imagine in queensland it was about ninety one hundred by the time we got you know we had bloody whatssaname was soaked in sweat and that he said get em off mate and then he he gave me a dressing gown and i put it on and then after the evening when you know they had entertainment yeah i had a marvelous time really i think everybody did really he he he even had all my whites you know me me shorts and me tops and all that all pressed and ironed and ready to go back on the ship and it got to a stage where the blokes were having such a lovely time that they they tried to bloody sabotage the ship but it didn't happen and of course we had to leave then then we left queensland and er where do you go then er oh yeah we went to fiji lovely oh lovely yeah yeah and that was bloody hot there well we done a march in fiji and i'm not kidding you with the rifle on and your marching along like that when they said shoulder arms it bloody nearly fell off mine i was so so tired it went whoompf like that but er very nice yeah i liked fiji so you never saw any you never came under attack from any of the japanese or anything in the area well no we well we were in the pacific but we were what you call a destroyer escort to a carrier you you can imagine the carrier stern's way up there and the destroyer's down here well when they went out on their raids they came in you know to land some of them hit the deck and pitched over and went in or they went if you see a carrier like you see the stern back where they put men always oh it's gone straight through yeah well that was our job rescuing people pick em out yeah take the long boat out and go and get them in and in those days they had dinghies with er liquid in there that kept the shark shark repellent yeah there were some nasty accidents when they come in and hit the deck and pitched over the bloody side and that was it we had to go out and pull them in what was left of them did you i was going to say did you get many survivors yeah we did yeah yeah we did yeah and where were you for ve day ve day er we were in hong kong i was waiting to come home on ve day but of course you don't come home straight away i came home on the battle wagon hms anson it was quite a bit of time before it got out there you know before we were brought back and then you have to wait before you come out and er while i was in chatham i was a rum boson well tell me about that what do you do for that cor god what did i do for it well i tell you what i never got out of those barracks without i was three sheets to the wind how i sometimes you know i think to myself how the hell did you ever get out of that bloody chatham barracks in the state you was in well the lads were we used to queue up on the terrace right liberty men and you form up like that and liberty men right turn you know left march and they used to squeeze me up tight so i didn't fall over and i'd march along and they'd keep me you know i was alright i kept on me feet i kept going and when you got out the main gate you got the there chiefs there and all that waiting you know to see what you got in your bags and all that well every liberty man came out with a little brown case you know probably with his stove in and a few cigarettes and er you know never i never got picked on just went out there all i had in there was enough money to get on the ferry and get over the other side and then wait to get home well in those days most men that were in uniform anybody would stop and pick you up and take you yeah take you out there take you home i found that in australia as well when when i went ashore on there on anzac day or anything like that right ho mate jump in here off you go wonderful the rum tot was usually very tightly controlled wasn't it yeah so how did you get away with getting well when when when the po and the officer marched off you know you're supposed to tip it away but you don't when i went to australia i picked up the the merchant ship the aquitania and on board the aquitania was all er ameri australian raf guys that had been discharged because they all been shot up during the war terrible terrible i've never seen human bodies burned so much in all my life and these all these guys were great guys all been discharged you know through their injuries you know and all going back to australia then when i got to sydney and got off there that's when i went in to the erm er camp golden hind hms golden hind it was a dispersal camp where they drafted all over the place and what was the ship you were drafted to then that you were doing the rescuing in well that that was it no hms armada she was a later battle class destroyer which was your favorite ship well out of the two i would say that er the armada was a a better boat really erm er for our side of it er i mean the milne was only equipped for that arctic situation but the armada was er a better built a later destroyer how do you reflect on your naval time then i i only went well you see the trouble was like most blokes during the war time like they really had enough to an extent then if you went back within a year you could er and you signed on then they would take that all your service in but once you left and passed the it was too late then and you'd got to start again but what i did i two years later i went in the merchant service and i done more years in that than i did in this because i got more money better pay
