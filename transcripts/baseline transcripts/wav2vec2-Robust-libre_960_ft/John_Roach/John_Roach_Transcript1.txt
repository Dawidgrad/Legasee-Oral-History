i 'm john roach and i joined the navy at achmat saint vincent in gosport in nineteen thirty eight and i'd done twelve months to boys training there before when i went on to my first ship which was santas iron duke why did you have a feeling for the navy over at any of the other services why because my father had been in the navy and my uncle had been in the navy and my brother was in the navy so it was a family affair really so we just automatically joined i suppose you know and then in nineteen thirty nine in august i was drafted to commission hachames renown in portsmouth so we commission the ship she'd been in there for three years from nineteen thirty six until nineteen thirty nine having a big refit and the captain said it was a case of putting new wine in an old bottle so the ship came out all brown new and we commissioned twelve hundred or twelve hundred of us went on board and commissioned the ship just before the war started and we had a quick rush to a munition ship and provision ship and do all the nec to see things and do quick sea trials and we were at sea the day that the war started on the third of september nineteen thirty nine on our way to scapa flow to join the home fleet and then i stayed on at masry now and then for five and a quarter years so i spent just about all the war on one ship just talk a bit about that the the the pre war period your training as a boy sailor what you were doing what was like it was pretty tough they talk about borstal and a young offenders train in these days but ours is tougher than that i think we had to get up at six o'clock every morning and over go up over the mash before breakfast and we may get a cup of cocoa and two biscuits to start in the day and then we had our had our and our breakfast and on a thursday we all had to go down to the laundry because we wore duck suits for the normal days the rig of the day so they had to be changed twice a week so we all in an up in the laundry on thursday morning scrubbing all our duck suits and doing all all our washing and that was all done before seven o'clock and the and then we were under various instructions in school and we we done schooling and we done seamanship and signals and a very various things naval history all appertaining to the royal navy you know but it was pretty well trained and it was her it was pretty good i suppose i stood us in good stead afterwards you know to when it when you think about the youngster join up these days they have about six weeks training had from israeli where we had twelve months training so they got extra time might have had of us without giving giving us any pension really because i our our time in the navy didn't start for pension purposes until we were eighteen so we done two and a half years for nothing as it were really and we we we went to see you now as boy seamen you know just a lot of boys seamen went to see at the beginning of the war you know but and here as a matter of fact there were about eight hundred over eight hundred boys seamen lost in the war was over a hundred lost an atom as royal oak he was nearly a hundred eighty yards lost and hates him as hood so he's a boy seaman and done the same work as an able seaman or an orderly seaman you know he done look out ammunition the carriers and now also a new anything i see man done we done was there anything in that training that you know you really liked or really disliked it's hard to say i suppose i enjoyed being with new company you know we was all the boys in that and you all mucked in together and you all became good friends so we we decided we were all in it together and once you were in you'd sign on you couldn't get out anyway so so you were stuck with it
