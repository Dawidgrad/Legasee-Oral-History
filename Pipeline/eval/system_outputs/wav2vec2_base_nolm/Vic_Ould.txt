ABEING BUILT IN SHIP YARD WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO WYM S AVORY WIME YARELLY NOW IT WASN'T READY AND WE COULD GO AND LOOK OVER THE SHIP AT ANY TIME WE LIKED AN MASS OF WIRES AND AND PEOPLE WELLED IN ANAND A I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT WE DED WE MUSTANWALKED ABOUT GRENAUK A ANYWAY IN A FEW WEEKS THE SHIP WAS READY ALL OF WIRES AND BITSAN PIECES OF BEN REMOVED AND W AR GIVEN OUR PLACES OD ON THE A FORID MESTEC WHO POINTED OUT WHERE WE AT OU LOCKA WHERE WE POT NEW CLOTHES WE WERE IN UNIFORM NOW OF COURSE ALL OUR CIVILIAN CLOTHES HAD GONE TO WE JUST HAD OUR ALL NAVEL CLOTHES THE FIRST OF THINGS WE HAD TO DO GO THROUGH TRIALS THE TRIAL TO TAKEAN UP THE CLIDE YOU HAD TO DO THIS SPEED WHATEVER DETERMINED AN E A FEW GUNNERY TARK ILL TRIALS ANYWAY WHEN WHEN WE FINISHED THE TRIALS AND THE SHIP WITH COMMISSION THEN INTO THE WORLD NAVY AND THAT WAS E TIME WE WAS GONG TO BE OFF NONE OF US WAS EVER WAS TOLD THAT WE WE GUNG TO GO A UNACERTAIN DAY SO IF WE HAPN'T TO BE HAVING SURELY IF WE COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY BUT THEN ONE DARK NIGHT SHORTLY AFTER WE FINISHED OUR TRIALS WE SLIPPED FROM THE DOCK DOCKS IDE THE YOUM OF THE AN HE YARD THE OTHER YARD AN AN EDGED OUR WAY UP THROUGH THE CLIDE NO LIGHTS OF COURSE DE CLOSED ALLABLE TO TITE DOORS ALL SCUTTLES OR THE DEAD LIGHTS AND A WE WERE GIVEN OUR POSITIONS THAT WE WERE ON WATCH THEN WE WERE REAL SAILORS AN SO AN I WAS STARBOARD WATCH SO THEREFORE I WOULD BE UP ON THE A HALF AN HOUR FON THE SARBORD WHAT LOOK OUT WE WE NEVER HAD ANY ACTUAL TRAINING FOR THIS IT WE JUST WERE TOLD TO DO WHAT E E RE TOLD SO ANYWAY WAGED OUT OF THE CLIDE YOU HAVE TO GO PAST THE BOOM WHICH LETURE OUT THE TIRED CIRED AND I REMEMBER I CAME OFF WATCH OR HAN'T GONE ON WHAT I CAN'T REMEMBER THIS DAY BUT I'D HAD REASON TO GO TO THE HEDGE WHICH ARE THE TOILETS I'D SIT DOWN JUST SITTING DOWN AND EES AT ENORMOUS EXPLOSION BHANG AND ORS RATTLE PULL ME TROWNING UP QUICKLY RUSHED OUT OF THE DOOR INTO THE UNWAT ICLD THE AND CANTINE FLAT THAT JUSTY AN PASSAGE WAY AND BUMPED INTO AND ONE OF THE OTHER SAILORS WOS OFFEE O WOR IXPEIN TO MO US AV WE' BEEN TALK PEDER O EVOR NOWR OUT NOW IT'S ONDY THE TILL PEDOM AN TRYING A DEPTH JARTES OUT BU SHAME FACE O DIDN'T GO BACT HE SAID I WELL YOU SIN TO ROAT FLACE DER ANY WER SO WE HAD A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT THAT ANYWAY FROM THERE AN T US OUT TE DARK NIGHT WHY WAS IT OLD AN TO CLAESS I WHEN YOU LEFT BUT THE DICHES WANTE THE PROBLEM THAT THE ENEMY A KNEW THAT THEUR SHIPS BEING BUILT NEARLY ALL THE TIME AND THEY WOULD COME OUT OF A DECLIDE OR COME OUT OF THE TIME OR CAN PERHAPS COME OUT OF AM A IRELAND AND IF IF F YOU CUN VISULIZE IRELAND AND SCOTLAND AND THI I NARROWS IS REALLY WIDE ITASE A LONG DISTANCE BEING NARROWS AS AS A CONTINENT AND THEREFORE SHIPS HAVE TO COME IN AND OUT OF THAT AREA OR THIS WAS ALWAYS THE PLACES WHERE YOU'D HAVE TW OR THREE UBOATS JUST A LURKING HOPING FOR A GOOD KILL AND WHETHER THEY EVER FOUND OUT THAT A SHIP FROM ANY SPOYS OR ANYTHING WAS COMING OUT AT THAT TIME OF NO IDEA BUT THAT WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS PARPU AT NONE OF US HAD WORKED TOGETHER WE'D ALL COME OUT OF TRAINING WID HAD GOOD TRAINING IN OUR OWN JOBS BUT OF COURSE NOT TO TAIN BECAUSE WE WERE NOT WITH THE SAME PEOPLE WO TRAINING WITH SO FROM THEIR ONWARDS YOU UPFRED HEBIDAS IT WAS REALLY AM THA PUT THE FEW SAILORS THAT HAD EXPERIENCE AND THE OFFICERS OF COURSE YOU WERE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU SR THAT HAD TO HAVE ALL THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO DO WHAT YOU WERE DOING COULD YOU' GET NO AN ESCAL YOUR SHIP COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN WET SIMPLY FIVE PER CENT OF THE CREW THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TO SEE BEFORE NEVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP BEFORE VERY OFTEN SO IF IF WE'D BEEN ATTACKED AT THAT TIME WE WAD BEEN A SETTING DUCK WHEN WE ARRIVED A SCAP OR FLOE WHICH IS RELATIVELY SAFE WE AM GO THROUGH THE BOOM AGAIN TO GET INTO THE FLOE AND FROM THEN ON WU TO DO OUR TRAINING WHAT A TRAININ TA SCAP OR FLOE REALLY IS TO GET YOU WORKIN IT TO AS A TEAM THE WHOLE SHIP HASN'T NO EXACTLY WHAT DEY DOIN A GOING CREW OF E FOUR O FIVE HAS TO NOR TO WORK TOGETHER AFFUR INDHE UN A TRANSMITTING STATION WHICH IS THE AMONDEN AN EARSE AND IS LIKE WE WERE AS GUNNERY CONTROL YOU'D HAVE UMABOUT TEN PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM WE SHOWN IN CHARGE OF AN ORDINARY ANSHITTING ROOM AND DONE EACH ONE OF THOSE HAD TA JOB TO DO BECAUSE A HONOURED DESTROYER WHICH WE WERE I MOSCAROMA A DESTROYER II BRAND NEW RUN AS WELL SO NOBODY WOULD KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND SHALL WE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE FAR CONTROL TABLE AS IT WAS WHERE YOU EIGHT PEOPLE ON IT AND ALL THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE ATHOUGH THEY'RE TRAINED ON SOMETHING SIMMLING A TRINING THEY STILL HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT IF THE SHIP'S ATTACKED OR IF WE SHOUHAD TAKE NOTHER SHIP SO THAT WAS WHAT WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF US IN THE FLOE AT THAT TIME WE WERE SO SURT OF DESTROYERS IN PARTICULAR AND OTHER ESCORT SHIPS SO NOT ONLY WERE WE STAIN IN AN ICE SAFE ARIA TO DO OUR TRAINING WE WERE SENT OUT A IN HARNESS AS IT WAS CALLED WITH ANOTHER SHIP THAT MIGHT BE MORE EXPERIENCE BUT THEN THE CATE CAUTIT ONLY ONE OF YOU THI EXPERIENCE ON ONE WHICH IS TRAININITED US OAN WE RELEARNT IT THE HARDWAY AR ALL OUR REAL FIGHTING AND WAS AROUND THAT TIME AND AT THE END OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR RICHASN A OCTOBER

VERY YEW BOAT THEAD BEEN LOOKING FOR IT ONE OF OUR SHIPS FIRST SO AHE MISS BULLINON HAD BEEN SUNK AND THE THE OTHER SHIPS THAT WERE WITHER WERE STILL LOOKING FOR THE THE EW BOAT WELL IAN N THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS DONE AS SKIFFER WAS VERY NOWLIDGIBLE VERY EXPERIENCED AND HE WENT TO THE POSITION WHETHER YOU BUT WHERE THE EUBOAT HAD SHUNK ATE MISS SOME AS SHE WAS BULLEN NOBODY AS TOLD ANYTHING HE

EIR ASDE GOT OPERATOR THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DOWN THERE WHICH COULD BE TO YOU BOAT SO WE DEPTH CHARGED THAT ARIA AND APPARENTLY THE AN ECHO WE GOT DIDN'T MOVE WHICH STAYED THERE SO WE ASSUMED THAT THAT WAS A YOU BOT AN EM NEVER NEVER CAME UP NEVER GOT IN THE OIL OR NEVER GOT ANYTHING SO AM AT THAT TIME ON THE WAR THE AN SNOR COULDD ONLY JUST STARTED SO WHICH HELPED THEM OTON IN THE WARE NOW THIS YOU BOAT IF IT DIDN'T COME UP WITHIN TWELVE HOURS THEN IT WAS A DEAD DUCK SO WE WAITED AROUND THERE ALL NIGHT WITH A BOARDING PARTY READY TO GO ON TO UBOW CAT IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME UP FOR

DON'T WANT THAT YUBOAT IF YOUERE STILL ALIVE THERE DOWN THERE TO KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL UP THERE WAITING TO IN THE END WE AND WENT BACK TO CAPEFLAU AND CARRIED ON WITH OUR AND LEARNING TO FIGHT WAR TELL ME ABOUT CHRISTLAS SCAP WELL AND THAT THIS WAS THIS I TOLD YOU ABOUT WAS THE SEXTH OF DECEMBER OR THEN THE TROMOL DROBS WE MIGHT HAVE DONE THERE I'M NOT SURE BUT THE NEXT IMPORTANTING BUT I COAND REMEMBER IS THAT WE WERE AND NOT REQUIRED FOR WORK AROUND THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD SO WE WERE BACK IN SCAPERFLOW AND IT WAS QUIET AND WE WERE SHAFE BUT NONE OF US IT HAD AS CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME BEFORE THIS AND THERE WE ALL WERE IN A DEAD PLACE SCAPLOW CHAPERFO'S TERRIBLE PLACE DED AT ANYTHING AND WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS THIS TWO HUNDRED ON THE SHIP ROUGHLY TO RUMDESHIP'S COMPLIMENT AND LUCKILY WE HAVE A FEW AMONGST US AT WERE EXPERIENCED AND THERE WE WERE THE COOKS AND E MESS WERE MAKING CHRISTMAS CAKERY WHATEVER STUFF WE COULD GET HOLD OF YOU ALL SO MANAGED TO GET I'M NOT SURE WHEREFROM A CHRSTMAS TREE FOR SOMEWHERE AND THAT HE RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE MAST ON THE TOP OF EVERY SHIP AT CHRISTMA TIME OF THEIR OWN HARBOUR HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE WHICH E RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE SHIP AND DAN WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED I THINK BY THE OFFICERS BEING CHRISTMAS BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WE WERE OR NOT AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE DRINK ON BOARD IT A DRAWER SHIP THAT SOMEOF TE OLD STAGES HAD SAVED SOMEBODY RUM RATION WHICH ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO BIGGISHESVERY BAD VERY HIRHY CHARGE ASHUR COURT BUT THE OFFICERS NORMALLY ON US ON A SMALL SHIP LIKE A DESTROYER CLOSER OYS TO LOTS OF OF THINGS THAT THEY WON'T BE ALLOWED TO IF THEY WERE ON A BIG SHIP THAT WE CALL A PASSERSHIP SO MANY OF THE LADS THAT WERE ALLOWED RUM I WASN'T BECAUSE YO'RE NOT ALLOWED RUM TI YOU TWENTY NARDONY EIGHTEEN AN BUT OUT CAME TO RUM RUSSIIN HORRIBLE I HATE E AN AN DONE PEOPLE MADE UP THINGS OUT OF PAPER AM I THINKSOM A PACTIN PAY FOR RED GREENAN BLUE CAME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES OUT OF HIRDYHOLES AND MADE INTO DECORATIONS ANA WE WERE MORED AT THE BOY THERE OF THE TIME AND MACIN CRESTMAS SONGS AN PIT SOME OF THE PEOPLE AD INSTRUMENTS IR YAD A SMALL BANG ON BOALD AN SOME O TER PEOPLE I SUPPOSE THAT CAYT SOME OF OUR LADS YOU COME FROM HOMES THAT NEVER AD IT BAD IL THINK ITA VERY TEARFUL FOR HIM I CAME FROM ER HOME THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY SO CHRISHMAS WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FO ME TO ANYBAD WE ALLL ENJOOD OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME AND IN A PLACED OT SCUP OF FLOERY I AS CATWARD AN COMMAND OF ROKERSON I WAS A OUR CAPTAIN AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A LAW FOR HIM REALLY AFTER WEVE BEEN WIVING FOR A TIME GRITALTHOUGH HE WAS VERY STRAIGHT AN HE WAS QUITE HAPPY TO TORN HIS LIE HE WAS HE WAS A LAD TE SIGME OF US IM LATE ON IN THE STORY WHEN WE GOT UP FOUR EAST AN I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT BUT HE WE HAD AND MULTIPOLO TEAMS AND HE WAS ON THE TEAM WITH THE LADGE AGAINST THE OFFICERS AND HIT THAT WAS THE TYPE OF PERSO NY HE WOULD BE ND A HE WAS I THINK BOXING CHAMPION OE OF THE FLEET OR PART THE FLEET AND A YET E WEN SUCH A NICE PERSON YOU KNOW AND THERE IS ANOTHER CASE I'LL TAKE IT TOU IN LITLWA WHEN ILL GO ASHORE SO AND BUT T E NEXT THING WE WE WENT ON REALLY AFTER CHRISTMAS AFTER CHRISTMAS WAS WHEN WE REALLY STARTED AND LEARNING THAT THERE WAS A WAR ON WE WOULD STILL GO OUT I WOULD STILL GO OUT AS A SHIP WORKING UP TOGETHER BUT THE FIRST ONE I WEET WE WENT OUT WITH I BELIEVE TWO AIRCROFF CARRIERS AND THIS WAS TO BE A STRIKE AGAINST NORWAY WE DIDN'T KNOW TILL WE WERE AT S THAT WE WERE DOING THIS BUT THERE WAS E COERCROFT CARRIERS SOME MORE DESTROYERS I THINK AND IM SOME OTHER SHIPS NOW OUR AIR DROB WAS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT TE AND ONE OF THE CARRIERS BUT IT WAS ALSO TO ACT AS IM A LIFE BOAT REALLY WHAT WHEN THE AM AIRCRAFT TOOK OFF AND I THINK A CUT OR THESE WITH ROLD TYPE AIRCRAFT AM I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE BUT THEY WERE BIPLANES NOW THIS WAS A REALLY ROUGH DAY AND THEY TOOK OFF O I WATCHE TEM OWASAN O MUCH ALL A TIME AND NOT I WATCH EM FROM THE DECK AND THE CARRIER WAS BALANCING UP AND DOWN BUT THEY TOOK OFF AND I THINK THEY CARRIED OUT OR TRYD TO CARRY OUT THEIR TASK BUT THE TWO ORSHOW COME BACK DIDN'T MAKE IT CAUS THEY THE SHIP WAS DANCING UP AND DOWN THE ELCAV CARRIER DANCING UP DOWN AND I BELIEVE ONE OF THEM HIT THE DECK AND WAS PUSHED OVEROLD ATCH WIT THE PEOPLE IN IT THEY CAN'T TAKE EM OUT PUSHD HEM OVEL TO MAKE WAY FOR ANOTHER ONE LANDIN AND THE OTHER ONE DISAPPEARED I THINK E WAS GIVEN ORDERS TO TRY AND FLY BACK TO HIS BASH OR AI BASEDBECAUSE HIT WAR TOO ROUGH TO LAND ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER WEARE I THINK BEING CRASHBOAT AT WAS CALD WE UNWENT TO TRY AND FIND THE AIRCRAFT AT DITCHED SADLY NO AIRCRAFT SO ANYWAY I THINK THEY HAD TO CALL OFF THE STRIKE COULD SUGGEST TO TOO DANGEROUS TO DO ANY MORE AN FLYING OR NOT THAT SO THAT WAS REALLY A BAED BEGINNING TO MY WAR A WE WENT BACK TO SCARPAR YOU TALK ABET BEING RATH HAV WERE YOUR FEELIG TERRIBLE I WILL SEASICK MOST TIMES I WENT TO SEE BUT WHEN YOU'D WHEN YOU AR WHEN YOU OR LOOK OUT OR WHEN YOU W'RE IN THE T S WHICH IS IN CALM THE T S IS DOWN BELOW AN AND THAT IS THE TRANSMITTED STATION THAT TAKES T THAT S LIKE A RELAY FROM THE DIRECTOR TOWER WHICH IS RIGHT UP THE TOP OF THE TRIP THREW YOU IN A TAESH TO THE MAIN ARMAMENT WHICH IS FOUR FOUR INCH GUNS SO AM OFERD THE COMMUNICATION NUMBER SO THE DIRECTOR WOULD SPEAK TO ME THE OF THE TWO OFFICES IN YOUR DIRECTOR WOULD BE SPEKING TO ME AND I WOULD BE SPEAKING TO THE GUNS BUT PART FROM THAT AM THE DIRECTOR WOULD HAD INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD IM SEND SIGNAL DOWN TO OUR BIG COMPUTER THE ORIGINAL AN MECHANICAL COMPUTER AND A MECHANICAL COMPUTER WOULD SEND THAT INFORMATION MECHANICALLY TO THE GUNS AM BUT ONCE I GOT INTO A POSITION WERE E HIS EXCITEMENT FORGOT ALL ABOUT SEA SICKNESS I WAS OKA SO THAT'S A GOOD THING BUT NORMALLY IF I WASN'T AN ON MO MARCH OR STANDING I BE STANDIN ON THE APPADEC WATCHING TO SEA HE OING UP AND DOWN AND PROBABLY BEING SICK THE ONLY TIME YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS IS WHEN YOUR EXPECTION ACTION YOU KNOW UM LATER ON AN I A TALK ABOUT THE MINE LION WE WERE AT ACTION STATIONS ALL THE TIME BUT IF YOU'RE DOIN A JOB JUST ESCORT IN THEN T YOUR ATCRUSIN STATIONS AND UNTIL SOME TROUBLE POPS UP UM DEPTH CHARGIN YOU BOATS IS NOT A CASE OF GOING TO ACTION STATIONS IT SHOWNY IF THE A YOU BOAT FIGHTS BACK THEN YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS SO ANYWAY AND WE WENT FROM THERE BACK TO SCAP AR FLOUGH AND I THINK WE DID ONE OR TWO JOURNEYS LIKE THIS AND OFF THE COAST ON NORWAY AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND EVENTUALLY AN WE A SUPPOSEDLY FINISHED OUR TRAINING OF WORKING TOGETHER AS A TAME MIND YOU ALL THIS TIME I'M I TERRET TALKING TO ABOUT NOW WE WERE STILL LEARNING BECAUSE WE WISH O SILL TEAMING UP WITH PEOPLE THAT WE NEVER WORKED THROUGH BEFORE SO IF WE'D RUN INTO ANY REAL TROUBLE AT THAT TIME WE WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD A LOT OF CHANCE IT WASN'T OR LATE ONE WHEN WE AND LEARNT THESE THING SO AN THE NEXT ONE I THINK AME IS AN IMPORTANT ONE IT SAYS IN ABOUT FEBRUARY I BELIEVE WE WERE JUST TOLD WE WERE GOING OUT I THINK THAT NIGHT N WE WERE NOT GIVING ANY REAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE WE WERE GOING OR WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO BUT IT WAS A VERY BIG DEW THERE WAS A VERY LARGE FOLCE AN IT WAS WE LEFT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT I BELIEVE I VESY DISH IT OUT A SCAPPER AND THIS IS THIS IS WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE MINE LION AND OPERATION AM IT IT WAS A VERY IT WAS A VERY ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO MOON IT WAS ALL STARLIGHT SO IT WAS VERY GOOD VISIBILITY AND IT WAS A VERY CALM NIGHT STRANE ENOUGH HARDLY ANY ROUGH SEA OR ANYTHING AND WE SHET OUT AND YOU SELDOM KNOW WHO'S WITH YOU YOU IT'S THE SILENT SERVICE YOUAVE NOT TOLD ANYTHING AND WE'VE BEEN ABOUT OUT ABOUT AN HOUR I BELIEVE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AND THE SKIPPER THEN SAID OVER TO TURNOY WHAT WE WAS GOING TO DO HE'D OPEN HIS ORDERS AN HE TOLD US THAT WE AR WE WERE A BIG FOLKE ONE OF THE LARGE FORKE WERE GOING A DOWN THE SHOUT SOUTHERN PART OF NORWAY TO EAGERSAND AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY WE WERE JUST ONE OF TWO SHIPS AN LADOAN WAS AZELIUS SAME SIRES THE SAME DESTROY AS WE WERE AND AR MAIME IAN TASK WI WE HAD TO RESCORT THIS UN MIN LAR ATOPECIA APOLLO AN FOST OF ALL BOTH FORCES WORKING TOGETHER HAD TO PASSRUE A BIG MNE FIELD AT THERE'S A BIG MINE FIELD THAT LAID A THING BY US AN AND DON WE HAD TO GO THROUGH ONE PATH FOR IT WE SHOULD ONLY PASS THROUGH IT BUT WE KNEW WHERE HE OPENING WAS O IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE ENOUGH WE DO GET LOOSE MINDS SO OUR ASDIC OPERATOR HAD TO AN PICK OUT THE MINDS THE MAY AND I WAS ON MACH AT ONE TIME AND I COULD HEAR SI HEARING MSAYING AN THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE PORT SIDE AND THE CAPTAIN WOULD MOVE THE SHIP OVER A BIT SO ANYWAY WE GOT THROUGH IN THE MIND FIELD ALL OF US WITH NO REAL PROBLEM AND DONE THEN WE SPLIT UP WE WERE TO WAIT TILL TWELVE O'CLOCK AND AT THAT TIME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE OTHER BIG FALS WHEN WE WERE BY THE WAY UP THERE TO DEVAGAR AT THAT POINT AND THE OTHER BIG FALS WAS TWO CRUISEAS I THINK AND AN NO ARCROFT CARRIED AT THAT POINT AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY E GERMAN CONVOY THIT WAS GOING TO LEAVE EAGERSOND AND WAS GOING TO HUGG AD A COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO AN STO STOBANGER WHERE WE WERE BUT WEE THE OTHER FORC WAS TO STOP EM GETTIN THERE SO DE ON TWELVE O'CLOCK THE AN THE OTHER FOLSE WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE CONVOY AND THEY WERE HOPING IN THAT CASE WHEN THAT STARTED TER BE LOT OF FIREWORKS DON FURTER LONG THE COACHED QUITE A FEW HUNDRED MILES BUT THAT WOULD TAKE THE HEAT OFF WHAT WE WERE DOING WE WERE A KIND ESTINE OPERATION THEAWE WERE TO ESCORT THE APOLLO TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WAS GON TO START LANE MINES DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK AND WE WERE TO BE BETWEEN HER IN AN NORWEDIAN COAST AND IF OF SHE WAS SIGHTED ON BY THE GERMANS AND OR PICKED UP BY RADE OF BY THE GERMANS AND NABOR TO START FIRING WE WERE TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS WE COULD AND TEAR UP AND DOWN THE BIT OF SHEE BETWEEN US AND BETWEEN THE APOLLO AND THE AM NOID ENCOURASHED AND THAT YOU AL DEGUNS AND FLARES AND EVERYTHING WE COULD TO TAKE THE HEAT OF HER SO DID ATTACK US AN SO THE APOLLO AN WOULD HAVE ID HAVE FLUSHED US OR INDICATED TO US OR NOT ON THE SHORE BECAUSE YOU GIVE EVERYBODY HAD TO KEEP RADIO SILENCE AN DON WE WERE ON CHILOTTE ROUTINE NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO SMOKE SHOW ANYTHING YOU WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO THE BANG BECAUSE THE NOISE AN WE WERE NOT FAR AWAY FROM THE COAST ATO ANDONUMP BUT THE TRIPS BOTH US AND THE OTHER ESCORT DESTROYED ASELIUS HAD TO KEEP UP AS MUCH TEAM AS WE COULD BECAUSE IF THE FIREWORK STARTED WE WERE TO HAVE TO AT FULL SPEED RUSH UP AND DOWN THIS BIT OF COAST FARING WHATEVER WE COULD PREVENT THEM TO TODE APOLLO WELL I COULD HEAR FROM THE GUNS CAUSOS IN THE AN A T S AND FROM A DIRECTOR AN BEFORE WE STARTED DOING ANYTHING AND I COULD EAR E PEOPLE THE GUN SAN WELL GET EE A HEAD LIGHT TAY THEY'E JUST JUST OVER THERE LITTLE BIT THEY CANT COMING DOWN GOING FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT NIKE AN EARAL IS THIT I OPE THEY CAN'T E AS FROM WHERE THEY ARE AND THEN HE SAID RIGHT HAVE STARTED DOWN THE OTHER END AND THEY STARTED FIRING DOWN AT THE OVER IND THEY ATTACKED HIS CONVOY AN DON THEY HAVE BEEN ECESIER WE COULDN'T I COULDN'T SEE ANY ANYWAY CAUSE IRE DANND IN A TYS BUT IS GETTING ORDER MESSAGES FROM A NOT THE TWO OFFICERS UP IN THE A DIRECT A TOWER BUT FROM MY MATES ON A GUN BEGUN EXCANN WIE GUN THEY HAV FINDAN INUAL TE INFORMATION IN THE MATE I THOGHT I THINK THAT BLOW SMOKING OVER THE O YOU KNOW ON THAT I REALLY CAN'T SEE US ANYOU WAY APPARENTLY YET THEY DIDN'T WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO MUCH BUT TRY WE WERE SWORRILY CRUISING UP AND DOWN AND THE YUN APOLLO STARTED LOWIN OUR MINES DED ON TIME DID ON TWELME O'CLOCK A THE THE MINE LOU A BIG MIE LAER THEY CARRIED O NOT MIND A BID CRUISER THEY ARE AND ONCE THEY SHAN'T LAY IN E MINE AND THAT TO WERE WE WOULD AE HAD TO COME IN THEY CAN'T STOP THEY'VE GOT TO DO THE WHOLE OF THEIR MINE LAYIN BECAUSE THE MIND FORS BEING LAID SO THEY CAN'T TURN BACK THEY CAN ONLY GO ON AND CARRY EM LAYIN THE MIND TO ANYWAY WE'RE JUST GOING SHOWING UP AND DOWN AND AND BECAUSE OUR SHIP WAS KEEPING STEAM UP READY FOR A QUICK DASH UP AND DOWN THE VAILS BLUE SO YOU GOT ANORMAL IS A WELL KNOWN DESTROYER HP RUP RUPE RUP WHICH WE DO EVERY TIME IN COMING AND OUT OF HARBOUR JUST TO SIGNAL AND APPARENTLY EVERYBODY WENT MAD DE CRUISOF WON'T MAD OU BIN CHARLOTTE ROUTINE YOU KNOW AND DON THE FACT THAT WE WERE NEVER SUSDOUT NOT TO THE VERY END AND OG THINK IT MIGHT EVEN BE IF ANYBODY HAD HEARD THAT RHOOP WHICH AD E A WELL KNOWN BRITISH DESTROYER SIGNALL TO SAY ELM COMING INTO HARBOUR SOMEWHERE IF THEYD THOUGHT I CAN'T BE BRITISH DESTROY NOT BEINHIS DAFT ENOUGH TO DO A THING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW SO ANYWAY AND THEY LAID A LAID THE MINDS AND THEN WE KNEW I DON'T KNOW BOUT SHICKING OR WHAT SHE SAID ALL DONE KNOW WE CARRIED OUT AMBITION SHE YOU MACK IN POLE AND IWAS AT THAT TIME LISTENING TO SOME O THE YEAR MON AND THEY WERE SHYING LOOK AT HER MOVE AND SHE WAS DOING FORTY KNOTS SHE'S RUN HE FASTEST SHIP TO HER AND THEY COULD SEE THE BAILWAVE MANAGE I IS IS NIGHT BAT AND IT WAS STARLIGHT AND YOU COULD SEE YU COULD SEE THE SHORE YOU COULD SEE THE PLACE WHERE THE COMES WERE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A CRACKERES OF THEIR KNOWN AND AN AWAY WENT THE AND APOLLO AND AND AT SPEDE AND AND WE TURNED ROUND BUT WE WE WENT AS FAR AS WE COULD BUT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO AT A GOOD SPEDE BECAUSE WE GOT A SIGNAL THAT THE GERMANS A JUST OUT THAT THEY WILD BE INTACKED ESPECIALLY FROM EAGERSAED WITH THE BATTER WE ARD ON THE NER AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE AFTER ITS ON THE APOLLO WHEN I NTO CATE EM I SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD AND THEY RINLY AM TO ANMOLISTER TELEGRAPHY OFFICE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT WE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED OR THE FAULE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED CHULD HAD PICKED US UP ON RADAR THE FAULS HAD BEEN CHALLENGED AND HE THINKS THAT THE AM APOLLO WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF COURSE AD GIVEN THE RIOT CHALLENGE A ANSWER BUT THEN THEY CHALLENGED AGAIN LATER ON AND DIDN'T GOT THE APOLLO HAD STARTED DISAPPEARING SO THEY SENT TORPEDOBOMERS AFTER US AND DONE THEY NEVER FOUND US SO WE GOT BACK OKAY SO DEMANDED HIS SUCCESSFUL OUR FOLCE DOWN AN FURTHER INK INKERSAN A EAGERSAN AND STOPPED THE CONVOY GOING UP TO GERM ADD THE GERMAN CONVOY THE DAN SUNK ONE OR TWO OF THE SHIPS AND VONITOR OF OUR SHIPS HAD ADDED INJURED PEOPLE BUT AN THE HOLE MISSION WAS SUCCESSFUL IT SAS TO ME LIKE YOU WERE EXPENDABLE WHEN YOU ARE AT HON ER WILL YOU POYU BUT WHY IS IT ILLY THOUGHT DESTROY WITH A VALUABLE BITIN KITS WHOCA BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF DESTROYER N AND IT'S CONFORABLES YET BECAUSE OHAT WA I WORSHIP WA I SHELL BERING IN IS BECAUSE LATER ON I'M WHERE WHEN TWARTY END OF TE WAR WHICH WON'T BE IN THAT ONE IS WHEN WE WERE A BIG FALSE ESCOLT IN A SOME OF THE CRUISES OUT TO THE FAR EAST WE ONLY TOOK EM AS FAR GIBRALTAR YOU SEE AND THEN ANOTHER FALSE TAKES OVER BUT WE WERE ESCOLT IN ABATTLESHIP THE RENOWN AND WE WERE THE CLOSE ESCULT ONDER SOWE EACH SIDE FERDY CLOSE WERE AS OTHERS WERE FERRED OUT AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAYLIGKT THIS AND I WASN'T ON WA JUD JUST LEANING OVERSIDE BUT WE WERE QUITE CLOSE BECAUSE THE CLOTESCAL YOU SEE AND I'M JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE AND OVER THE TANOI COME THE VOICE FROM THE CAPTAIN WE ARE NOW REACHING A DANGEROUS AREA AND THERE MIGHT BE YOU BOAT AROUND IF AYEU BOAT AS FARE E TORPEDO AND THAT IS ANPICKING UP OF WHAT ET WHIC WE SHEE THAT TO TRACK OF THAT TORPEDO HEADING TOWARD BIG SISTER WHICH I CALLED RENOWN THEN WE STOP IT YOU KNOW WHAT WE MEAN HERE YOU STOP IT AND THERES ME LOOKING OVER THESIDE LOOKING AT THE TORPEDO BOLGE ON THE RENOWN AND THINKING YOURSELF YES YOU CAN LOSE TWO HUNDRED MEN JUST AS TOP OF TORPEDO BENDING LITTLE TORPEDER BUMBLED YOU KNOW YOU DON'T YOU TELL ME A BE ABOUT THE ROLLERG WITH HIS STOYER WELL ROLL ROLL OF THE MOST DESTROYERS IS THERE FAST AND THE MANEUVRABLE AND THEY'RE LIKE A SMALL AVERTION OF A CRUISE THEY HAVE AL DE GUNNERY BUT SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'RE GOT FOUR BIG GUNS FOR POINT FIVE BEGUNS AND OTHER SMALLER GUNS HAD TO ALL THOG THE ONE THING THEY'VE GOT EXTRA AN APART O THE SMALLER SIDE SCOULD DOWN THE BIG SHAPS HAVE NOT GOT ANTI SUBMARINE EQUIPMENT THEYRE GOT TOPEEDERS AND THINGS BUT UNTESS TER SOMBANGES ON HE SURFACE THE'E GOT NO DEBT CHARGES SO AND A DESTROYER HAS TEP CHARGES SO WIT WITH THERE TO BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIFFERENCE THE REASON WHY YOU GOT DESTROYER AS WELL IS JUST AS I SAID IF THE ANCAPITAL SHIP OF WHAT AD IS YOUR GUARDIAN IS TORPEDOD THE LAST RESULT IS YOU GETTING I WAY OF THE TORPEDO DI'D RATHER LOSE A SHIP THATS ONLY GOT TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED MEN ON MOULD THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSIN MORDERNTER UNDED MEN ON THE BOUTSHIP REMOTE AS IT MIGHT BE IF IT' GOT A TOLPELOR BOLDG AND THIS SA WAR WE SHORT TO OF SHORE OF DESTROYERS BECAUSE SO MANY THEM GET LOST BECAUSE THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN A TORPEDO IS SITED IS TO GO TO ATTACK THE SUBMARINE THAT FIRED IT BUT YOU SHOULD BE NEAR ENOUGH TO GET A WAY OF TO TORPEDOUGH IF OU APS TO BE HEAD IN YOUR WAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALKED O BIT I HOW YOU WORN'T IT SEENG YOU WERE VERY YOUNG THROU IT THER A MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE ON BOARD WAY YOU THOUGHT WE WORK IN BRILLIANTLYU KNOW AN WELL NOT REALLY YOU JUST THOK FIT IN AN PART OF LIFE IS YOU YOU MANAGE TO FIT IN TO EVERY CITURATION IF YOU'RE LACKY ENOUGH AN AN YOU ATHOUG'L NEVER WORRIED AN YO THINK BECAUSE YOU A GOOD SWIMMER A YOU MUST BEWY EVEN IF THE SHIPS INKS BUT THEN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU SPEAK RATHER PEOPLE I YOU'VE GOT SHEA BOOT ON AT THE TIME A YOU'VE A SA BELT WHICH AN SHOULD SHAVE YOU WHICH YOU WEAR ALL THE TIME AT SEE BUT YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT BELT BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT GETS IN THE WAY OF YARNS AND EVERYTHING SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU HAVE TO JUMP INTO THE HOGGIN AS THEY CALL IT THE SEA THAT BELT MUSTN'T BE BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT MIGHT BREAK YOUR ARMS SO YOU EXPECTED TO BLOW THAT UP WHEN YOU HIT THE SEA AND THEN I CAN'T SAY A IT LUCKILY I NEVER HAD TO BUT I HAVE ER SURVIVERS HAVE TOLD ME YES I HAD TO BLOW IT UP AS SOON AS I HIT THE WATER AND I HAD NO BREATH AT ALL LEFT I COULDN'T BLOW IT UP BUT THE SEA BOATS DRAG YOU DOWN BECAUSE THE DISH IS WHAT YOUE WEAR IN I IT'S IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WAS THE NEXT BEG OF ENY YOU WED CALL IM UMWETHER IT WAS REALLY MANDANE MOST TE THINGS EVEN EVEN AM A AT ESCORT TO THE MONSTERS THAT WE DID THETE YOUR ENEMY IN MOST CASE IS WAS TO SAY WE GOT BATTERED LEFT ROYOT AND CENTRE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE CREMARY AND CUEEN ELIZABETH BECAUSE AS WE TOOK THEM OUT OF THE CLOUD WE JEGJAG ROLLED AWAY WITH EM AND WE KEPT UP WITH EM TILL THEY REACHED THEIR TOP SWEED WHICH AND WAS DEDITIONED ABOUT FURTHER THE WAY ACROSS AND THEN WE LEFT THEM AND WE AD AV WAITED AROUND FOR THE NEXT ONE COMING IN FOR INSTANCE WE MIGHT HAV TAINEN HE QUEAN MARY OUT AND WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO WAIT JUST A FEW HOURS FOR THE QUEEN ELIZABETH TIC HAD COME IN AND DON ALL THE TIME ONE OF YOU MIGHT PICK UP ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU AS TO CUEAN MARY WOULD HAVE ITS OWN AZDICK BESIDES ITS OWN RAD ARE AND WE OF COURSAT THE AZDIC AND RADARE ON OUR COHOLT PERHAPS TO CAVALIER WOULD BE THE SAME WELL WHEN WE'D STEAM OUT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE APART AT THE EXTREMES OF YOUR ATAZDICK CIRCLE AN YOU RADE OUR CIRCLE SO YOU DIDN'T INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHER'S RETREAT OF THE THE WAVE AND IF WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH MIGHT BE E SUBMARINE MIGHT BEN A RACK WUND IMMEDIATELY WE'D RUN UP A BLACK FLAG ON OUR FLAG DECK SO THE QUEEN MARY WOULD KNOW AND YE'LL SHOW THE CAVALIER WOULD KNOW THAT WE'VE PICKED UP AN ECHO IMMEDIATELY WE'D HIVE OFF TO ATTACK THA ECHO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE IN TROUBLE IF IT IS IF THAT'S A UUBO YOU MIGHT HAVE ALREADY FIRED IT TOLPELO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU TURN OFF SWIFTLY AT FOLSWEED IF YOU CAN IF YOU GOT BEAM SEE IF YOU CULRNT TURN OFF LEFT ALL RIGHT IT WOULD A BEAM SEE A DESTROY GOT HARDLY ANY DRAUGHT YOU'L TURN OVER STRAIGHTWAY SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY EGGER WE NEVER DID WHETHER IT LUCK OR IS BY JUDGMENT I DON'T KNOW THEN YOU AY THEN IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HIT WI TALK ATHOUGH THEN YOU'D FIND YOUR WAY TO WERE OF THAT IM ECHO WAS AND YOU WOULD ATTACK THE ECHO SO YOU LUSHOFF ABOUT TWO DEP CHARGES FROM ONE SIDE TO FROM THE OTHER AND ROLL OFF OFF THE TWO RACS OM THE REAR SO AS PATTEN ABOUT TEN CHARGES WELL IF THE UBO IS A VERY EXPERIENCED ONE AND HE WAS WATCHING YOU ON THE PERISCOPE HE WOULDN'T BE THERE WHEN YOU ARRIVED HE WOULD I'D HAVE GONE DOWN LOW OR HE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BUT LEAST YOU KEPT HIM DOWN THERE 'S NO CHANCE OF HIM HIT IN YOUR CHARGE ANDER THEN WE'D HAVE TO TRY TO CET IT UP TAKE ABOUT HALF A DAY BECAUSE TES THEY KEEPIN THE SAME SPEED EVEN IF THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO LEAVE TE QUEEN MARY OR TO QUEEN ELIZABETH THE QUEEN MARY WOULD CARRY ON IT WOULDN'T STOP AND ONE OF THE MORST THINGS THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY'D ACTUALLY TOL EDO TO QUEEN MARY THEN IT WOULD HAVE LOST A LOT OF LIVES BECAUSE WHILE YOUR THE QUEE MARY WUL IF IT'S COMING BACK IN IT HAVE FULL COMPLIMENT OF AMERICAN GEIES THATOUD BE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND WOULD BE CARRYING NOW THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TIGHTEN UP THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BECAUSE THEY'RE GO IN FROM THE DIFFERENT DECKS ALL THE TIME IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF WE GO INTO ACTIN STATIONS THEN WE COSE OUR WATE TIGHT DOORS WHICH MEANS OF YOUL TAL PADO YOUR MIND IT WILL ONLY DAMAGE THE COMPARTMENT WI OR WITHIN SO THE SHIP MOST LIGHELY WON'T SINK BUT IF IT'S ON THE CRAM MARY DIDN'T HAVE GOT NO CHANCE OF ANY O THER WATE DIGHT DOORS BEIN CLOSED BECES TER TRAVELLING BETWEEN A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DECKS THEY'RE TRAPPD SLEEPING ON ONE DECK TRAMLING UP THE NEC DECK TO EAT FOOD ANOTHER DECK FOR EXERSIDE E TOPDEC IS ALWAYS EXERCISE TODA COULDN'T OF COSE COT WORD FAT DOORS O ANY OF THOSE WHO'D HAVE BEEN ON THE BIGGEST DISASTERS WOOUD FIND WHAT WAS YOU LIKE SEEING THE SHIPLESS TE QUEEN MARY THE QUEEN ELIZABIT THE SAYNG ON YOU HAVE ANY FIND WITH ANY MILITIAT THAT YOU KNEW O EM WERE PROUD OF ANYONE WELL UN AN ALALL WE REALLY KNEW WAS THAT WE WAS GOIN TO PICK UP BONTER MONSTERS OR BRING ONE MONSTER TIN O OD IF IT WAS THE QUEEN MARY AND WE WERE IN GREENOCK THEN WE WOULD KNOW IS THE GREEN THE QUEEN WHERE WER TAKEN OUT AND THAT'S ALWAYS GOT THREE FUNNELS ANYWAY IF WE PICKED UP IF HE'S GOT THREE FUNNELS ITS QUEEN MARY ASS GOT TWO FUNNELS ITS QUEEN ELIZABETH AND SO ON YOT FORMER FOUR FUNNELS FOR THE AQUITANIA AND SO IT WENT ON BUT YOUWEE NEVER TOLD YOU WERE JUST CHIL OUTS AND AND GO TO RENDEZVOUS WHERE YOU'D WAIT AROUND OR YOU'VE READY CONTACT WITH THAT SHIP TO TELL YOU THERE AND YOU BRING IT IN VERY OFTEN A EVEN WE TWO WERE ESCORTS ONE WOULD BE AT GREELOOK AT THE CLIDE NE OTHER BE DOWN AT LIVERPOOL AND WE WOULD REACH A POINT OF RENDEZVOUS GOING OUT O THE CLOWEAD AND THE OTER AN THE CAVALIER FRAPS COME OUT TO LIVERPOOL AN EN WIG STEAM UP TOGETHER TO THE AN I RONDIFOU POINT FOR THE AN THE MONSTER DID THIS HAPPEN ALMOST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK FOR A MOLO ALOFUS WE NEVER HAD THE SAINE COHALT AN BECAUSE THAT WOULDN'T ALWAYS BE IN THE SAM AREA THEY' BE DOING SOMETING ILS AND BETWEEN THAT IS YOUR DUTY SHIP IF AN THERE WAS AN AIRCROFT CARRIER WHICH HAPPENED IN ONE CASE ON A MENTALPEDOGE WE JUST COME DOWN FROM SCUPPER TO A TOGRELOCK AND WE'D JUST ARRIVED AT THE HARBOUR ENTRANCE WE WENT STRAIGHT TO AN OILER BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO FILL UP WITH OIL BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO OUT AN JUST AS WE AT THE OILER WE GOT NEW MERDINCY CAL TO SAY THAT SOME AN AIRCROFT CARRIERD BEEN TORPEDO JUST OUT IN THE AN A CLIDE THE BEGINNING OF THE CLIDE SO WE AN JUST LET GO FROM THE OILER AND WE WENT STRAIGHT OUT TO A TO D THE THANE IT WAS IN ER ERGROFF CARRIER AND STRANGELY ENOUGH SHE WAS ON HER OWN SHE'D COME FROM LONDERRY SHE'D HAD NO ESCORT A'M LUCKILY SHE DIDN'T HAVE A FULL COMPLIMENT OF AR OF SEAMAN AND SO FORTH AND SHE WASD COME IN TO AN TO THE CLIDE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY TORPED O THAT LITORPEDOD AN A MERKINSHIP AT THE SAME TIME AND YOU BOT GOT AWAY ALTHOUGH WE WENT TO ATTACK IT IT WAS DARK AND A WE LEFT THE OTHERS I THINK LOOK INTO THE YEW BOAT AFTERS WHERE WE CAME CANE BACK IN T HARBOUR O HOW LONG YOU WOULD SEE WHEN YOU ARE INY ALANTIN ON OFTEN WE GOING BACK TO BACIN GEVING IN LANDLIP IN A DESTRAW NOT VERY LONG BECAUSE YOU YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT MUCH FUL UNDER YOUS UGING YOU STOP SPEED ALWAYS MANOEUVERING YOUR ONLY WAY OF GETTING FUEL IF YOU'RE OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS FOR FROM ONE OF BIGGER SHIPS OTHER FAM MANAIRCRAFT CARRIER OR SOMETHIN AS BIGG AS A BELLFAST A CRUIZER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ALSO FOOD YOU FOOD RUNS OUT AFTER A SHORT WHILE SO THE ONLY TIME WE'VE REALLY OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS AN WHEN WE'S UP AT SCAPPER WHEN WE'S ON WORKING UP WHEN WE'S GOING OUT ON EM FOURAYS TO A TO ELP TO SANK TE TEP TO PITS OR TO IN OTHER JOBS A MOST OF THE OTHERS IT WAS A CASE OF GOING OUT JUST FOR A DAY OR TWO TO PICK UP ONE O THE MONSTERS AND THEN COME BACK WIT THE MONSTER OLL TAKE ONE OUT AND LEAVE IT IN WHICH CASE WE'D HAVE TO GO TO LONDON DERRY PERHAPS AND THEN WE COME OUT LONDON DERRY AGAIN AND I'LL GO OUT ON THAT SHO WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT RESPECT NO WE WERE NOT OUT FOR VERY LONG DERE' DON'TLY ON ONE OCCASION WHEN WE WAS OUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME MUST BE OVER TO FIVE DAYS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE OCCASION WAS BUT WE HAD RUN OUT FOOD AND WE WAS FURTHER UP IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND OUR CAPTAIN WAS A EX FISHERY FLEET MAN YHAD HIS OWN FISHERY FLEET MEN SO WHAT HE DECIDED TO DO AS WE RUN OUT THE FOOD HE SAID I KNOW WHERE THE FISH AM R SOUGH HE GUIDED THE SHIP UP TOO WHERE HE KNEW THEY WERE PICKED UP A SHAWH ON THE RAGUDAR IED ON THE AZDIC DROPPED AT E SEPCAHAGE LOWERED THE BOAT PICKED UP ALL HOOD OF FISH THAT CAME UP AN STUNNED AN STOOD ON THE FORECSHOL WE SAW HIM SAD ON THE FOREASHOLE AND SAID UP MY MIND PITOPLETES ONE WE LIVED ON FISH FOR A FEW MORE DAYS AFTER THAT IONE FIGGER BUT OUR RUNS WERE MOSTLY AND JUST ABOUT FIVE DAYS AT A TIME BUT THAT MEANT THAT EVERY TIME WE CAME IN TO THE ER A EITHER SCAPPER OR IF WE WERE IN LIVERPOOL OR TO DEDICLIDE WE HAD TO ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF SURE ON BOARD BECAUSE I ASSURE DIS ASSURE AND THE DUETY DESTROY ER AND THEN IF SOMETHING COMES UP WHERE SHIPS BEEN SUNK WE HAVE TO GO OUT STRAIGHT AWAY AND YOU MIGHT BE OUT FOR A LONG TIME LOOKING FOR A SUMMRING OR MONE ONTS OMBRIN SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THE FACT THAT A WE NEVER WENT OUT FOR A LONG TIME I THEVOIGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OILING AN'T SEA WHICH IS A DANGEROUS PRACTICE ANYWAY AND A PICKING UP FOOD NEVERTHING FRONT FROM IT CAN YO DISQUITE RAGER YES I NOT ME E ON YO RAY IGHT YES VERY OD AN WOR FIRST OF ALL WEN O ON THE RAID OR SET ITS ONLY A SMALL SETS AND A IT THEY'RE DIFFERENT TYPES THAT THE TWO NINEH REE THAT IS HIGH UP IN A MASK AND THAT SPECIALLY FOR PICKING UP AN AIRCRAFT OR SURFACE SHIPS REALLY ATANY ANY DISTANT UPLON CAN'T THINK OF THE RAT RANGE RANGE OF IT BUT IT SENDS OUT SIGNAL FROM THERE WHICH OF COURSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT ANYTHING YOU DON'T GET IT BACK BUT IF IT HITS ANYTHING EVEN CLIFFS OR OR AN AIRCRAFT OR SURFACE SHIP THEN IT BALANCES BACK AN ON THE SCREEN VIEW ON WHICH IS A A ROUND SCREEN UNDER THE A THE CURSER IS GOING ROUND ALL THE TIME THAT WILL SHOW A BLIP ON THAT BLIP YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT OME A CLOUD WHICH IT MIGHT BE I DEPEND ON YOUR ADAR WHUT IT'S DOING A VERTICAL OR ANGER ANDER YOU WILL THEN READ OFF THE DISTANCE AND THE ANGLE OF EVERYTHING THIS IS MOSTLY ONOR HONO LEVEL BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER SCREAM WHICH GIVES YOU THE HEIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT SO YOU YOU USE ONE WITH THE OTHER THAT THAT AND WHEN AT AN SIGNAL ELECTONIC SIGNAL HITS ANYTHING THEN IT RETURNS AND THEN YOU YOU READ OFF THE DISTANCE OF IT BUT IT EAT IT IS NOT ITS EASIER TO OUSE AN WERE WE FIND A DIFFICULTY IS MY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN WHAT YOU LOOKING AT OR THE LAND BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF IT ON THERE OR IF IS A SMALL BLIP THEN IT IS AN AIRCRAFT O SHIP OR WHATEVER IF IF YOU KNOW YOUR USIN ONE TYRP OF RODD ARE IT'S ONLY AN LONLY HORIZONTAL IF YOU USE ANOTHER ONDECOME HORIZONTAL OR AN AIRCRAFT AND IT WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD DISTANCE THE TIME IT TAKES OF COURSE IS BASED ON IFIT TAKES TEN SECONDS GET FROM THERE TO THER THEN HI AND YOU READER OFTEN SCREAN LUCKILY AT OUR POINT INOR WE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE IN AIRCRAFT THE ONLY TIME WE WOULD HAVE HAD PROMIN FIT THAT IS IF THE TORPEDO BONGS HAD BEEN SENT AFTER US OR OFTEN ORWAY THEN WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO USE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD NOW ET THE AIN WE'D HAVE TO USE A TWO RAD OR SETS THEN THE ONE THICH GIVES YOU A SIGNAL IN THE HEIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT THE OTHER ONE WHICH GIVES YOU A DISTANCE OF IT AND THEN YET YOURE TRAINED TO NO RICHED ATTHE DIFFERENCE AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT FAR AS IN' REMEMBER IF IT WAS ONE OF YOUR OWN AIRCRAFT IT WOULD HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION SIGNAL WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW ON YOUR RAID OR SAT BEFORE IT HAD GOT TO YOU SO YOU YOU'D HAVE TO BA PRETTY WELL EXPERIENCED BUT MY TIME WOULD NOT ALWAIS ON A RADARSAT YOU WARE SOMETIMES ON LOOK OUT AS A SEAMAN WHERE YOU'RE SHETTING UP IN THE LOOKOUT BOX ON THE STAR WASIDE WAS MINE AND YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR AIRCRAFT WHICH WA NOT VERY OFTEN BEFORE AN SURFISH SHIPS OR MORE THAN LIKELY YOU ARE LOOKING OUT FOR A REITLE TINY PERISCOPE WHICH IS VERY HARD TO SEE IN A ROUGHER ATLANTIC OR YOU MIGHT BE UNLACKY ENOUGH TO SEE THE TRACK OF A TORPINO COMING TOWARD YOU IN WHICH CASE YOU GET INTO A PANIC ANE CALL OUT QUICKLY TO THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE AN THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE ANTHE CAPTAIN OR THE AN OFFICER OTHE OTHE WACH AT THE TIME IN THOSE DAGE IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE NOWADAYS ITS ENCLOSED BECAUSE AN OPEN BRIDGE SO THE BRIDGE IS HERE YOU GOT THE LOOKOUT PAS JUST HERE TO YU JUST CALL OUT TO THAT PERSON ON THE BRIDGEH OFFICER SHIP BEARING RED FIVE OU GRENFIVO WHERE WERE YOUR POSITION IS ANGLE OF SIGHT IF IT'S AN AIR CRAFT AND IN MMETLY A LOOK AT IT AND DESIDE YOR ACTION TO TAKE BUT IF YOUR THAT LOOKOUT POSITION WHICH I WAS ON QUIET A LOT AS A SAMAN IS ROUGH CAUSE AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN ALL THE TIME A BEEN A DESTROYER YOUARMOST A SABMARINE AT TIMES THE WHOLE OF THE SEA COMS UP OVER YOU AND YOU GET NOT BACK AGAINST THE SERCH LINE IT'S VERY DAMP THAT IS VERY ROUGH UNCOMFORTABLE BUT AND THIS IS WOING TO GET USED TO YOU USED TO WEAR AND A SPECIAL SHOIT WHICH COVERED YOU COMPLETELY WATERF SUIT WITH CAPAB FANIN AND BUT EVEN EVEN THAT THE WATER BU ALL THE WAY DOWN AND YOU GO SOAKING WET I REMEMBER COMING OFF WATCH ON MON OCCASION LIKE THIS CAUSE NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO CLIMB BACK DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE LADDERS O THE SHIP BECAUSE TE THE DOORS THAT YOU WOULD GO IN AN OUT IN PORT OR OPEN WHEN YOU OUGHT SEE THOSE DOORS SHALL BE CLOSED BECAUSE THE WATER COMES IN THOSE SHALL YOU HAVE TO CLIMB DOWN LADDERS DOWN THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP NOT NOT OUTSIDE IN THE SEA BUT CLIMB DOWN FROM THE TOP BACK TO THE ADE AND IF YOU NOT CAREFUL THE WAVEIN ET HITS YO YOU CAN GET WASHED AWAY O YOU HOLD ON VERY TIGHT WELL THIS WAS THE MIDDLE WATCH THAT ILCAN RECALL WHICH I FROM TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN TE MORN TWELVE O'CLOV AT NIGHT TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BUT YOUE NOT ON WATCH A AND LOOK OUT ORL THAT TIME OF THE FOR OUR WATCH YOU DO DEFERT JOBS OLF OUND ON LOOK OUT OFF OUR PRAP FROM TE RADE ORS AT OFF OUR ONE HALF HOUR BEHIND HAY GUN WHERE THERE'S A GOT YOU BECOME PARTLY GUNGRU SO IF YOU DID HAVE TO GO INTO ACTION YOU WOULD DO THE SHOOTING OR THE REAL GUN THROUGH IS CALLED UP TO TAKE OVER FROM YOU WELL ON THIS OCCASION ITAD BEEN VERY WELL OUTSIDE I'D GOT SHOKING AND TIRED OF SAM MIDDLE WATCH FROM YE ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK I'D COME DOWN I WENT DOWN TO MY MISTAKE WHICH HAD INNER FORCUL I'S A ROUGH PARTTHE SHIP I I HADN'T SLUVE MY HAMMOCK I'D SLEPT ON ME AH CUSHIONS THIS TIME I I DIDNT FENTSE SLEEPING ON TE CUSHION BECAUSE THE SHIP WAS GOING SO MUCH THIS WAY ND ON YOU WAD COME OFF THE CUSHIONS SO I GOT DOWN UNDER THE MESSH TABLE IS ABOUT THAT MUCH WATER ON THE FLOOR THE DECK TOY NOT THE FOR ON THE DECK ABOUT THAT MUCH SO I GALL ME COD ON IS I DIS DUIT SUS YOU CALLED IT AN EVERYTHING AND I'M LAYING DOWN OW OFF TO SLEEP STRAIGHT AWAY NEXT TE GO NO I TOUGHT AD TOUCH ME AND I OPEN OBLEARY EYES AND THERE AS THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH AND THE LEADEN SEAMEN OF THE MESS AND YOU SAYING TO ME I'M TOLD IS IN THE MORNING BY THE LEADIN HAND OF THE MESS E E SAID THE OFFICER SAID YOU COME ON SAMWEN YOU CAN'T SLEEP UNDER THERE IS TOO WET AND I SAID AND HE LOOKED AT THE LEADEN HAND AND SAID WHAT DID HE SAY AND THE LAMES INE DE NO DON'T READ THAT LANGUAGE AND SO OH WELL WE'D BETTER LAY YOU LET HIM SLEEP THERE LOOKIN THERE NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT IT I BY YOU YOU LINE IN THAT MUCH WATER THE THE DECKS OF THE SHIPS WERE INSIDE NOW INSIDE YOUR MISTIC THE WATER JUST IT'S AN ONE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE AND A LITTLE BIT WARMER INSIDE SHOW ALL HUMIDITY ALL THE WATER RUNS DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE DECKS ANY TIME YOUON THE CAVALIER YOUYOU HAVE A LOOK THE INSIDE CISH YOUR METAL WORK OF THE SHIP'S SIDE IS ONLY ABOUT EIGHT OF AN INCH NO THIGGER THAN THAT AND AN SO THERE THER ARE WERE YOU GOT WATER MOST OF TIME ON YOUN YOU ON YOU MESTICS WHEN YOU'RE AT SEE AND YON HARBIER NOT TOO BAD IT GET TO BET UNCOMFORTABLE THERE WAS ANOTHER TIME WHEN WE WORKED WITH QUEEN MARY AND WE HAD TOE PICK ER UP TO BRING HER REN WE WENT OUT ETTIN M UP ONE OF THE ROUGHEST STORMS THAN WED ABOUT THREE REALLY ROUGH STORMS IN THE PERIOD THAT WE WEREKIN IN THE ATLANTIC AND WHAT WE HAD TO AT THIS TIME A BE ABOUT MARCH NINETY FORTY FIVE WE HAD TO GO AND PICK UP THE QUEEN MARY KNOW THAT THE STORM HAD BEEN RAGING ALL AWAY FROM AMERICA AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE A THAT THE BIXOMDHAD COME ACROSS OUR WAY AND THE CREAMARY HAD BROUGHT IT WITH US ORT OF THING AND WE PICKED HER UP ANDA I THINK WEE A DAY OR MORE WAITING TO PICK HER UP BECAUSE EVEN SHE HAD BEEN HELD UP BY THE BAD STORMS WELL WE AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAS A SISTERSHIP AT THAT TIME BUT WE GOT REALLY BENT UP WE LOSTA AMOTOR OAT WE LOST AN ONE OF THE A WHALERS AN AND WE GOT REALLY KNOCKED E OUT AND WHEN WE GOT AND TOWARDS THE CLIDE THE QUEEN TO QEEN MARY KNOWING THAT IT WAS IN THE AREA THAT THERE WOULD BE YOU BOATS WE HAD TO RELOYON ER SPO SO AS AS WE AV GOT WITHIN HAIGL IN DISTANCE ISPOSING SAY OF UNDER A THE CLIDE AND THE QUEEN MARY DECIDED SHE COULDN'T SLOW DOWN TO KEEP UP WITH US CAS IT WAS TOO ROUGH OF US WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER AND SO SHE JUST FLUSH THE MESSAGE SHE YOU IN TA CLIDE TATAR AND SHE KEPT UP HER SPEED AND GOT INTO THE CLIDE NOW SHE HAD THE WHOLE OF THE FRONT OF HER BRIDGE STOVED IN AND IS THE BIG SHIP WELL UP IN THE AIR THEY HAD A LOT OF CASUATIES BECAUSE THEY CARRING ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND A TROOPS AND AN THIS WAS NOW LATE AT NIGHT I THINK ABOUT UN LEVEN AN TOCLO A TEVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT BUT ANYWAY SHE GOT INTO THE CLIDE WITH WITHOUT ANYTHING BUT SDAMAGE FROM FROM THE SHA WE LIMPED IN LATER ON NOW EN THE CLIDE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO AN ANCHOR AND WE COULDN'T GO FURTHER IN TO GRENOK TO GREENK BECAUSE AFTER THAT YOU GO THROUGH THE BOOM AND THE BOOM IS CLOSED AT NIGHT UNTI IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARIARY TO OPEN THE BOOM WHICH PREVENTS OR ELSE TO PREVENT AND YOU BOT GETTIN AT THAT POINT SO AT THE OTHER SIDE WHERE WE HAD TO UN TW UP TO A BOY WE HAVE TWO FOR JUMPERS TO TRAW UP TO A BOY YOU HAVE TO STOP AND YOU HAVE TO LOWER YOU WHALER WIH THE BOYJUMPER AND THE ROWIS IN IT TO TAKE YOU TO THE BOY WITH THE CHYING TO CLIP IT TO THE BOY WELL IF I'VE GIVEN YOU A PICTURE OF HOU ROUGH THE STORM WAS IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT FURST WHALER WE WE UNM AND LET DOWN ON TO THE WATER MANAGED TO GET DOWN SAFELY BUT GOT WASHED AWAY WITH A CRUIN IT FURTHER DOWN THE CLIDE AT WS HE WAY FOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO LOWER ANOTHER WHAILER ALL OF US WAS UP ON THE FORESHORE WE ARE LL TO SEAMEN THAT COULD HELP WAS UP ON THE FORESHORE AND A COULD YOU CAN'T USE YOUR ANCER YOU JUST USIN ANO CHAIN WHICH GOES WITH A AWAWIU ATTACHED TO THE INDER DY ANCOR CHAIN UNDER THE WAILER HAS TO TAKE THIS WIRE TO THE BOY TO CLLAMP IT ON TO THE BOY AND THEN THE BOYS PULLED BY THE ANKERCHAIN NEARER OF THE SHIP SO THAT THEY CLICP IT ON SO ANY WAY THEY LOWERED THE SECOND WALER THE BOY JUMPER MANAGED TO GET ON TO THE BOY AND IN DOING SO BROKIS WRIST AND TE IN THE END AFTER A THING IT WAS ABOUT FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO CLIP UP TO THE BOY AN DONE THE E CAPTAIN SAID TOPPED ALL ROUND A I HATED TO SMELL AROUND AN ANYONE AND NEVER WOULD HAVE HADMLE TOP THAT IS HORRIBLE BUT A WELL HAD IT THAT NIGHT BECUSE WE WERE FROZEN FROZEN STIFF AND A WE UNDER TOOK IT AWAY RITLIT BUT NOTHING WAS EVER SAID ABOUT THIS TIME A THING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH A PEOPLE AT THE PORCH KNEW THEG BIG SHIPS COME COME IN IT WAS NOT E A THING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THE GERMANS ALSO KNEW TAA THEY WERE BRINGING THE OLD ESE LARGE NUMBERS BETWEEN A TEN AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS IT COULD CARRY AN DONE ANY OF THE YOU VOTE CAPTAINS I UNDERSTAND AND IT IS NORMAL KNOWLEDGE WERE OFFERED A LARGE SUM OF MONEY THOUSANDS OF A E THAN DOR DOGEMR DOGEMAR THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK AND THE HIGHEST OF THE BAT OF HONOURS TO HAVE KNOCKED DOWN ANY ONE OF THE MONSTERS BUTA WE NEVER LOST ONE FORTUNATELY E UBY ASIDE BUT THE THE QUEEN MARY AND WAS REALLY BATTERED VERY BADLY BATTERED HOW WE DIDN'T IT TURNED OVER O INO IDEA WHEN YOU TALKING BACT MAKS ES AL SO ASIEYY TO WELL IF YOUF YOURE AN HE TID THE STIEGE ITSELF YOU TOLD ABOUT WELL AND THERE IS JIS GENERALLY KNOWN THAT SOME ON AWAVS WAS SIXTY FOOT HIGH NOW IF YOU THINK OF SIXTY FORT GOING UP THAT WAY WHEN YOU GO UP TO THE WAE AND YOU COME DOWN TO THE TROUGH YOU GOT HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOOT AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN CUT THROUGH THOSE WAVS AND THE BIG SHIP'S OR THE SMALL SHIPS YOU ATTALOY GO UP ON THAT WAVE AND THEN YOU FEEL IT THAT YOU COME DOWN WITH A HA CRUNCH LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU UP TO NEXT ONE AND ALL THE TIME YOUR CORK SQUIRRIN KNOW UNION YOU'RE NOT STILL AND YOU GET USED TO THIS AFTER TOUT A FIRST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE YOU GOT ROUY ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE YOU YOU GO THROUGH A NORMAL AN CORIG FLATS THEY CALLED ON TO STRAWER THE NORMAL CORRIDOR ON THE FLOOR ON A FLIT AND TO STRAWER WHICH IS ABOUT THAT WIDE WELL WHEN YOU FIRST GO ABOALD ONE LIKE THAT AND IT WAS FAIRLY CALM WHEN YOU SET OUT FOR CHCAPPER FROM GREELOCK BUT AS YOU WALK ALONG THE DECK COMES UP TO ME YOUYET GOS UP AND NEW HIT YOUR FEET AS YOU GO DOWN ON THE DECK BUT BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THAT DECK HAD GONE AWAY AS THE SHIP GOS DOWN AND THIS ITSUE FROM THE TOP AND THEN ALL THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING THIS THIS BULKET IT YO UNLESS YOU KNOW THAT BALKET ITS YO SO IN TIME YOU LEARNED TO WALK LIKE A SAILOR AND I'S THE SHIP GOIN DOWN YOU GO DOWN WITH IT AND COME UP WITH IT AND THAT'S WHAT YOU FINE SAILORS AN WHEN OU GET ASHORE THEY WORK WITH A ROLL WALK WITH A ROLL THAT IS JUST THAT THERE STILL WALKING ON THE SHIP A E YO WERE Y EAT AT YOA YOU'LL NOT FINISH YE AN BRYDA ITSELF WE WERE AN AS TUST ANNOYANCE ANI WE WERE BRINGING IN THE OLD F FRANCE AND WHEN WE GOT NOTICED THAT THE PEACE AND AD BEEN DECLARED FOR NEXT DAY AN WE WEE COMING INTO GROW INTO GRENOC SO WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN THE LAST OF THE ONSHIP CONVOYS BEFORE THE WAR ENDED WE ARRIVED IN GRENOCK I BELIEVE IT SODER WENCE YOUR SUNDY I'M HALF THE SHIP'S COMPANY WAS ALLOUD LEAVE WHICH WASN'T ME OF O WASN'T ONE OF THE SHIP'S COMPANY BUT THEY WENT ASHORE TOO AN TO GRENOCK WHEN I'D GOOD TAN NO TIME SO I THEN WE STILL CARRIED ON WITH SUMMONES CONVOYS AFTER THERE BECAUSE OM THERE WAS QUITE A FEW OF THE EW BOATS APPARENTLY MISSION A LOT THEM A ONE OR TWO WENT TO O BRAZIL ON WHATEVER SO THERE WAS A CHIL STILL A CHANCE THAT IF THERE WAS A ROAD ROAD YUVOAT AROUND AND COULD HAVE KNOCKED DOWN SOME OF THE YAN MONSTERS WE WERE SOURE BRINGING BACK IN BUT WE HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL BUT TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORE ANYWAY AND WE WERE THEN DESTINIE TO GO ACROSS TO AN THE END TRYD TO END THE JAPANESE WAR SO TO BY TWO OUR FLATILLA WENT IN FOR REFITS WE WE WENT IN FOR REFIT LATE IN MAY AN JUNE AND CAUSE WE WERE GOING OUT THERE ANYWAY BUT FORTUNATELY WHILE I OEDON IT AND LEAVE TO GO OUT THERE THE SHIP WAS DOWN AT ON DAVENPOL BE REFEDDED THE WAR ENDED SI SHUL GOT TELEGRAM TO SAY DANT LEAVE EXTRA PLALY VECTAR WHEN WE CAME BACK TO THE TRIP WE STI GLAD TO GO OUT THERE BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING TO CLEAR UP AF TO THE WAR WOR AND THE WHOLE OF OUR FLATILLAR FOR OUT THE THEN WE WERE THE LAST TWUI SO AS WE REN OUT GIBRLTA MALTA AIDAN AND PLEASURE AKE THAT WE WERE THOUGHT WE RESEMBLE A LOVELY SUMMAGE CRUIZE BUT THEN WHEN WE GOT TO SING A POR NO WHEN WE GOT TO TRINK AMALI AT ON AVIL BASE WE BASED AT TRINK AMALI AND MALSO BASED AT SINGAPOR OR WHEN WE GOT TO SING A POR AH THIS WAS JUST ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THESE WOR AND AN WE WERE COING OUT AN EXERCISE WITH A ATMESUSSEX AND ANOTHER SHIP AND AN THE CAPTAIN OF THE FLILED THE FLITILLA LEADER WHO WAS ON AIMESEDE AND A OURSELVES IN CAVALIER WERE ORDERED TO GO WITH THE SUSSEX TO AN A PROBLEM SO WE IMMEDIATELY WENT AT FORSPEED W WERE SENT TO A TO JARVE WE ARE STOPPED ONA A COUPLE OF TROOP SHIPS ON THE WAY I CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THAT LITTLE BET BUT WE TOOK ON BOARD OUR FOR OUR FULL DECK WAS COVERED WITH INDIAN TROOPS ARMED INDIAN TROOPS AND THE CAVALIERS AS I M AND THE SAESAR WAS ALSO AND THE SHOSSECS ANCHORED OUTSIDE CURABACAS IT CONGEDIN WE COULD HARDLY GET INCOS I AS A A SUNKEN A JAPANESE CRUSA IN THERE IN THE WAY SO I WAS CHESAR WHEN IN FIRST CAUSE SHE IS PHILITELAIDA FULL OF TROOPS WE WENT IN SACONS AS WE WERE SECOND AND THEN THE CAVALIER AFTER US IS WE WENT IN AT DAYLIGHT WE HAD ALL THES TROOPS ON BOARD SOS IF THAT ANY TROUBLE WE COULDN HAVE USED OUR GUNS BCAUSE O TROOP LUCKILY WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE FROM THE SHORE BUT AS WE CAME INTO SUROBAER IKE ATERS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE AND THERE WAS BODIES DOZENS OF THEM IN WHITE NOVAL UNIFORMS I THINK THEY WERE C PROBABLY DUTCH I DON'T THINK THEY WAS OURS BUT WE WERE SLOWLY MOVING OR AVOIDING THE DISH WRECKAGE AND AVOIDING THE BODIES AND AN WE GOT TO THE SLAVE NOW WHEN WEALLY IN A WAR BODIES IN A WATER MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU EUDITLY ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT THEY WERE BODIES AND DEAD NOW AND THAT SO ANYWAY WE SLEA YO MOVED IN WE ANCHORED IN THE A DE DOCH THERE AND AN ONE BY ONE CRUISER DISCORGED HER TROOPS FIRST AND E CAME IN NEXT SO THE THREE OF US ALL OUR TROOPS WENT ASHORE
