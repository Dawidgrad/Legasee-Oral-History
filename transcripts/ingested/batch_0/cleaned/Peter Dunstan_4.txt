the next big thing you did was you took churchill to america yes what was what did you know about i mean i take it you weren't told well we got churchill coming on next wednesday what was it like how did you find out what you were doing there was virtually no information passed the fact that mr churchill the prime minister was being is coming aboard were taking him to america and that was it and he used to wander down the mess decks and he come along and you find your sitting there next to him talking to him and then he'll beetle of and he'll go around somewhere else he wandered all round the ship but he was quite a great character the thing was the thing i do remember about that was that the we were to meet the americans in arcangle bay in canada and the yanks had placed a dirty great big red buoy where they wanted the prince of wales to anchor and to great satisfaction of the royal navy as we come up alongside this dirty great big red buoy the officer of the watch ordered the anchor to be released and he dropped it straight on top of this dirty great big red buoy sort of two fingers up to the americans you want us there were there on top of it and that was the main thing i remember about that of course i can't remember what day it was but i know that on the sunday there was a church service aboard the prince of wales when roosevelt came aboard the prince of wales and churchill and we had the church service and i got somewhere among my records a photograph taken and i was right at the very back against the rail at the service well i got a photograph somewhere taken that day can you remember any of the conversations you had with churchill no cor it's now forty fifty sixty sixty seventy its over seventy years my apologise one thing i was curious about is you know you've obviously had a major engagement it's forty one your off to america looks like there coming in can you remember much about what the sense of war was like what it was like now at this point against you knew it was a major war no i mean we were engaged i was engaged in the gunnery side and the machine shop you thought about that you didn't you didn't think about you were serving the country and you just carried on i mean you had no political thoughts what so ever as far as i can remember so on this journey to america with churchill and the return did you encounter any you know u boat action mountainous seas the one thing i do remember was that on the way back we came across a british convoy coming from america to england and the prince of wales steamed right through the middle of the convoy showing the flag and there was churchill on the stern of the prince of wales waving like mad at the ships as we went passed that's the only thing that i can remember about that what about you touched upon earlier about some of the storms that you encountered do you remember anything any particular rough seas now no forty five thousand ton battleship i mean alright she did toss around a bit but you it was just one of those things you never thought about operation halberd never heard of it september forty one says participated in operation halberd along with the battleship nelson and rodney as well as the aircraft carrier the arc royal oh that's the mediterranean i never knew what it was called yes that was another one we did there were fourteen transports and the orders were that malta was on its knees and we had to escort and there was the nelson the rodney the arc royal as you say the prince of wales oh dear i got it i think i got it on my ramblings upstairs there was three or four cruisers and i don't know how many destroyers and our orders were malta at all costs and the germans attacked us and the only ship that got a torpedo was the nelson and she got a torpedo right in the bow of the ship the front of the ship and she was going down at about going along about five degrees in the water the bows were the bows she was sort of sailing slightly down in the water and the other thing i remember about that was the fact that a german plane now who was he attacking i can't remember who he was attacking but i know one of the arc royal aircraft got his tail and shot him down and i'm not sure now or i can't remember exactly but i believe it was the prince of wales was firing anti aircraft and shot the british fighter down as well we shot the british fighter down he shot the german down then we shot him down and i remember we got back after we delivered the convoy we went back into gibraltar for a day's leave and we happened to meet this pilot he was rescued the british pilot the fighter and the language he called the prince of wales and us was unrepeatable when you say you went to malta i take it you did you get on shore in malta no no it was a question of delivering these transports to malta because they was starving and as soon as the all clear was done we turned round and went straight back as i say we called in at gibraltar for the day i always remember the shops in malta because i mean in war time rationing and things like that and i found in a sweet shop a seven pound box of cadbury's milk tray chocolates funny how you can remember these things and i bought this box of chocolates sealed with a brown paper seal around the outside i slipped it off took one of the chocolate's out for myself slipped it back wrapped it up took it to the padre on the prince of wales or was the censor got it censored and i sent it home to my mother that's the only thing i can remember about malta
