HIGHLANDS VERY WELL THEY ARE A THING TO THEMSELVES WELL SO JUT DO ME A FAVOUR THEN JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A BAM WHAT THE BASE WAS LIKE WHAT YOUR SURROUNDINGS LIKE WHERE YOU SLEPT IS IS OPEN AND OPEN YEWE'LL TALK ABOUT THE WORK WEL OPEN FIRST OF ALL I WAS STATIONED IN WHAT WAS CALLED THE STATION HOTEL AND THE SIGNAL STATION ON THE PER WAS ONLY A SHORT WALK AWAY I MET UP WITH A GIRL WHO WAS GOING TO WORK WITH ME SHE'D BEEN THERE ABOUT A WEEK WE HADN'T YET STARTED REALLY GETTING THE CONVOYS IN SO WE WERE TOLD WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN BUT THE CONVOYS WOULD COME IN AND THEY'D BE IN THE BAY AND WE HAD TO MAN THE SHIP MAN THERE ALL THE TIME AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO ON ANY BOATS AND THAT'S ANOTHER THE STORY WE HAD TO MMONITOR EVERYTHING COMING IN AND OUT WE ALSO HAD TO LOOK AFT FUNNILY ENOUGH RF HAD THER SUNDERLANDS AND CATALINAS UP THERE D THEY HAD A CALL SIGN WHICH CHANGED EVERY HOUR OF THEM COULD NEVER EVER READ IT SO WE USED TO HAVE TO READ THEIR CO SIGNAL FOR THEM TO SEND THEIR PATROL BELT OUT BUT THAT WAS UNNOWN TO OUR BASE WHO NEVER HAD A CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON IT WAS A CRAZY SET UP REALLY SUBMARINES ON PATROL DUTY USED TO COME IN ALONGSIDE THE PEER WE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THEM THEIR SIGNALS THEY HE WENT OUT ON PATROL THAT WAS MOSTLY WHAT WE WERE DOING AT THE PER SIGNAL STATION THIS WASN'T ADEQUATE ENOUGH GANEVAN SIGNAL STATION WHICH WAS RIGHT ROUND THE CORNER FROM WHERE WE WERE WAS STILL MANNED BY THE MEN ADTHEY ALSO HAD A NEW ASDIC CENTR OPENING UP JUST BELOW WHAT WICH WAS RADAR ON ASDICK THEY LET AS DO DONE BY THE MEN THE MEN WERE GOING FROM GAGNEVON AND THEY WERE GOING OVER TO LISMORE THE WRENS WEREN'T ALLOWED OUT THERE BECAUSE E IT WAS COMPLETELY ALONE OUT THERE IR WAS NO IHABITATION XCEPT A FEW A FEW SHEEP FARMERS THE WRENS WEREN'T ALLOWED T IN LISMORE AND THAT'S WHERE THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN HADEN'T BEEN KNOWN TO ANYBODY UM GANGEVAN SIGNAL STATION WAS GOING TO OPEN UP AND WE WERE GOING TO GO THERE WHICH MEANT VERY GREAT DIFFICULTY BECAUSE FROM THE STATION HOTEL TO GANEVA IT WAS ABOUT COUPLE THREE MILES TWO OR THREE MILES IN THE MIDDLE OF TA NIGHT AN THAT WAS NO JOKE EVENTUALLY I WAS THERE FOR P SIGNAL STATION FOR ABOUT I WOULD SAY ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE GANG OF THEM WAS OPENED GANGEVN SIGNAL STATION WAS THEN OPENED UP FOR THE WRNS AND WE TOOK OVER FROM THE MN WE HAD AN INTAKE THEN OF MORE VS WRENS SO THERE WERE NOW SIX OF US INSTEAD OF FOUR WE TOOK OVER GANEVAN FROM THE MEN VERY VERY SPARTAN WHEN WE WERE AT THE PIER SIGNAL STATION WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE MEALS WITH IN HE MESS PROPER MEALS AND WHEN WE WERE ON NIGHT WATCH TEY WOULD DO US UP NICE SANDWICHES WHEN WE MOVED FROM PER SIGNAL STATION TO THE GANEVAN SIGNAL STATION WE WERE STATIONED AT A PLACE CALLED RASI LODGE WHICH WAS VERY TOUGH GOING THEY DIDN'T LIKE WATCH KEEPERS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T HANDLE US NEARLY ALL NEARLY AL THE WRENNERY WAS WRITERS TOPERATORS WHO WORKED PROPER WATCH HOURS THEY WERK NINE TO FIVE NOT US WE HAD YOU KNOWWE HAD TO DO IT WATCH KEEPING HOURS SAME AS THE NAVY IF YOU WERE LUCKY YOU GET HOT DINNER IF YOU DIDN'T YOU JUST HAD A SARDENE SANDWICH THE FOOD WAS PRETTY SPARSE IF YOU READ IN THE BOOK PEOPLE AND MY FRIENDS WHO READ THE BOOK SAY WHY DID YOU STAND IT I SAID BUT THERE WAS A WAR ON WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY DIFFERENT WE HAD TO GO DO IT IT WAS OUR JOB THE MEN IT WASIT WAS A VERY VERY SPARCE SIGNAL STATION M YE WANT ME TO DESCRIBE IT TO PASTHE SIGNAL STATION ITSELF WAS RIGHT ON THE TOP F GANEVAN JUST BY DONEDONOLLE HOUSE WHICH IS THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND LADY M DODLE I THINK THEY WERE CALLED YES MAC DOODLE IT WAS ON THEIR LAND ADIT HAD BEEN BUILT AS A LOOKOUT POST I THINK ORIGINALLY FOR THE COAST GUARDS IT WAS AVERY SPARCE EATUTER PLACE YOU HAD TO REACH IT BUT TO GET TO IT IT WAS TO CLIMB UP A CLIFF SHEER CLIFF THE ROAD WENT BELOW US AND THE SHER CLIFF UP WHICH WE HAD TO CARRY THE OLDEST LAMP BATTERIES WHICH WAS VERY HEAVY AND THEN WE HAD TO HAVE A COAL FIRE BECAUSE WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO BURN ANY CONFIDENTIAL BOOKS WHICH WE HAD IF ANYTIF WE HAD ANY KIND OF AN INVASION WE HAD TO PUT BOOKS GOODNESS KNOWS HOW BECAUSE THEY WERE LEAD LINE THEY WERE SAFE FOBUTWWHI WE HAD THE WE HAD A BUNK DOWN BELOW NUP THE TOP ADA BALCONY ALL ROUND WE HAD A BIG TEN INCH THREE AUDIST LAMPS AN ART AT RTE SET IT WAS REALLY JUST GO THAT WAS IT JUST PUSHED INTO THE DEPEND AN HOW FAR COULD YOU SEE FROM THERE IAN WHAT WAS YOUR WE COULD SEE LITERALLYWHERE SHE'D GOT IT WE COULD SEE RIGHT WE COULD SEE MUL RIGHT THE WAY DOWN TO MUL OVER TO LISMORE WEL WE HAD PERFECT VISION OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS COMING AND GOING WHY WAS THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT STRETCH A COASTLINE IN TERMS OF THE CONVOY JNBECAUSE IT WAS VERY SAFE UM THOUGHT THEY COULD COME IN IF YOU COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE MAP THERE WAS A COMPLETE BAY AND TOBER MORREY THE ESCORT SHIPS USUALLY BOUT TWO OR THREE DESTROYERS WOULD DROP THE CONVOY OFF AND GO UP TO TOBER MORREYG THEY WOULD GO UPSOUND OF MULL IF YOU COULD VISUALIZE THAT COAST LINE MUL ALMOST PROTECTS THE BAY ANY SHIPS PASSING HAVE TO GO ROUND BEHIND THE MULL THEY DON'T REALIZE EASCOMING IN THAT'S ANOTHER STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK UM ITWAS A VERY SAFE HAVEN THCAME IN THEY WERE ESCORTED OFF FROM US PROBABLY DOWN TO GIROKCIGANTE WD INTO THE CLYDE FOR UNLOADING OR THEY WOULD MASS UP READY TO GO OUT THER WAS EITHER AX OF ARRIVAL OR AN EXPECTED TIME OF DISPATCH THEY WERE EITHER COMING OR GOING AND WHAT WAS THE MOST SHIPS OYOU THINK YOU EVER SAW THEM I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE HARBOUR WOULD BE FULL I WOULD SAY T MORE THAN THAT YES THIRTY MOST LIKELY AND OF COURSE YOU'D D HAVE A LST AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY MIGHT BE A STRAGGLER BUT THEY WEREN'T THEY NEVER CAME YO'DTHAT WAS THE TERRIBLE THING OU THINK I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ONE WE HAD QUITE A LOT OF LOSSES UNFORTUNATELY NT INOT IN THE BAY COMING AND GOING YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE A THE SHIP BECAUSE WE ADED HAVE A LIST SENT TO US WHICH WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL LIST AN EXPECTED TIME OF ARRIVAL AND YOU'D GIVE THEM ABOUT TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT CAME YOU K YOU JUST WONDER WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WERE ALL MANNED BY MOSTLY MERCHANT MERCHANTMEN SO THEIR MORSE WASN'T VERY GOOD BUT NOW AND AGAIN YOU'D GET A SHIP WHICH HAD A FEW NX THE UNITED STATES WHEN AMERICA CAME IN IT WAS BETTER PLANNED YO K THE LIBERTY SHIPS CAME THEN AD THEY WERE BETTER MANNED THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OVERPOWERING REALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO SHALL I SAY THIS OVER CLEVER USED TO SEND MORSE AT THE RATE OF KNOTS THINKING THAT WE COULDN'T ANSWER IT WE WOULD SEND BACK AT THE SAME RATE THIS IS WHY WE DIDN'T LIKE THE AMERICANS VERY MUCH I'M AFRAID THEY TRIED ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY TRIED TO COME UP UP TO OUR SIGNAL STATION NDWE COULDN'T HAVE THEM IN WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM IN WE HAD ONE OR TWO PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE COMING UP SHALL I GO ON ONE NIGHT EFOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE THING AND A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND I THOUGHT THIS VOICE I DIDN'T WAN'T KNOW WHO IT WAS HIT WAS A MAN'S VOICE WE ALREADY HAD A WRN MURDERED IN VERARI OR VS WREN MURDERED IN VRARI ON NIGHT WATCH SO WE WERE ALL VERY WARM WHICH N INTRPE WE ALL WERE TAUGHT HOW TO HANDLE A PISTOL WE HAD TO GO ON THE RANGE WHICH WAS THE RF HAD A RANGE AND WE WERE TAKEN ON TO THE RANGE BY AN INSTRUCTOR AND TAUGHK TO FIRE PISTOL AND ICAE WIH VERY SMALL RISKS AND I WAS TAUGHT TO FIRE HOLDING MY WRIST SO I COULD FIRE IT MY WRIST WE ALSO HAD A RIFLE UP IN THE SIGNAL STATION IT WASN'T LOADED THERE WAS NO AMMUNITION IN IT BUT THE PISTOLS WERE ATBUTHIS RIFLE WASN'T LOADED IT WAS JUST THERE AS A WARNING I HEARD THESE FOOTSTES AND THIS IS PERFECTLY TRUE I HEARD THESE FOOTSTEPS COMING UP AND I SAID TO MY OPO I DON'T LIKE THIS VERY MUCH S THIS T KEPT KNACKING ON THE DOOR AND IN THED CAUGHT THIS RIFLE AND I THUGHT NOW I CAN'T I KNEW IT WAS UNLOADED ANI THOUGHT WHAT ARE WYIU GOING TO DO SO I PUED IT UP THE OTHER WAY AND AS THIS VOICE CAME THROUGH THE THING I LIFTED IT UP AND IT WAS GOING TO CLONK HIM ON THE HEAD WITH IT HE SAID IT'S ALLRIGHT JONE IT'S ONLY ME AND IT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNALMEN FROM DOWN BELOW STUPID WHO'D GOT A DATE I HAD CHANGED WATCHES WITH A GIRL I SHOULDN'T HAV TA TO TELL HER THIS REALLY E OBVIOUSLY USED TO COME UP FOR A CUP OF TEA AT THISTIME AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH HER HE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON WATCH AND HE NEARLY GOT HIMSELF KILLED AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEI WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE IN MY RIGHTS WE NOBODY D GOT A GREAT BIG PROHIBITEVE NOSANCE UP ON THE DOOR BUT OU KITNEVER EVER CAME TO ANYTHING AND I NEVER EVER REPORTED IT BECAUSE WHEN IVE GOT HIM INTO TERRIBLE TROUBLE BUT WE WERE ARMED BUT ONLY WITH A PISTOL D A RIFLE WITH NO AMMUNITION BECAUSE WE'D HAD INVERARI WHAT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T KNOW I'M AFRAID ALL THAT IS A NEED TO KNOW VER TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WE WERE JUST TOLD TO BE VERY AWARE ULD TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS I THINK STEPNEY MENTIONS THIS IN HER BOOK AS WELL WE NEVER EVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED WE HAD A WE THOUGHT WAS A SPY A MAN USED TO COME DOWN IT WAS ALL PROHIBITED LAND FOR CIVILIANS BUTTHIS MAN USED TO COME DOWN SIT ON THE ROCKS WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS ANHE HAD BANOCLUNS AND A CAMERA WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CONVOYS WE COULD TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AROUND THE ROU NO THING BUT NOT E CONVOYSNOT ALLOWED TO SO WE REPORTED THIS MAN TO OUR HEADQUARTERS K SIGNALBACK IN THE STATION HOTEL NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ABOUT IT HE JUST DISAPPEARED WE NEVER EVER HEARD WHETHE E WAS JUST A LOCAL NEWSPAPER MAN OR WHETHER HE WAS A KIND OF A SPY OR WHETHER HE WAS JUST INTERESTED IN SHIPS WE NEVER HEARD I'M AFRAID IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS ALL NED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD ADYK JUST PICKING UP ON THE AMERICANS YOU WERE SORO TALKING ABOUT STORY BECAUSE THE AMERICANS GAVE YOU SOME HASSOR YES WELL THEY WOULD TRYING TO BRIBE US THEY WANTED TO COME UP THE SIGNAL STATION LOOK OUT OW LOOK HUNNEY WE'VE GOT SOME NYLONS OHONEY WE'VE GOT BUNANAS ON BOARD THE SO STUPID AND SO CHILDISH WE TOOK A DISLIKE TO THEM WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE WAS THE WAY THEY USED TO TREAT THEIR OFFICERS COMPLETE DISRESPECT THEY WOULD CALL THEM BY THEIR FIRST NAMES WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS TERRIBLE THE CAPTAINS DALL THE AND THEIR OFFICERS NEVER SEEMED TO TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THEM WE WERE IN OBORN ONE DAY SHOPPING AND THE AMERICANS CAME ONBOARD CAME OOBVIOUSY SHOPPING AS WELL AN U W HAD TO TAKE US FOR A CUP OF COFFEE OK FINE WHICH THEY DID WE TOOK THEM TO THE MC AND WE HAD A CUP OF COFFEE GOING BACK SOME OF THEIR OFFICERS WERE COMING THE OTHER WAY WE WERE APPALLED THE WAY THEY SPOKE NO SALUTING HIH HIH A CAP ITGT THIS IS TERRIBLE I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT THEY WERE JUST ANOTHER WORLD AWAY ND THEY WERE TRYING TO BRIBE US WITH BANANAS AND NILONS AND YO KWE DIDN'T PUT ON TRENE WE THOUGHT THATIT WAS SO CHILDISH WITH ALL THIS VERY FAST FLASHING MORSE YOU TOUCHED ON THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF YO KNOW COMMUNICATION OU HAD THE SEMAFOR OTALKED ABOUT THE LAMPS THERE ALL E A SO WHEN DID YOU USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNICATION WIS IT ONE SPECIFIC TYPE IN THE STATION ALWAYS BY MORSE BY LIGHT OSOMETIMES BY RT NEARLY ALWAYS WTHE RT WE REALLY ONLY USED FOR THE ASDEC STATION LAMP MOSTLY THE OLDEST ALL THE BIG TEN INCH WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT OF COURSE TO HANDLE YOU HAD TO GO OUT ON THE B OF COURSE UP THERE THE WINDS WERE ALWAYS AT GALE FORCE AND WE ALWAYS HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FORFOR THE WEATHER EVERY DAY WE HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOR THE CONVOYS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER WAS WHAT WERE THE CONES THE CONES WERE I THE COME WAS A SHAPE LIKE THAT AND YOU HOISTED IT I CAN'T REMEMER WHICH WAY NOW UPWA UPWARDS FOR THE NORTH WIND AND DOWN FARS FOR THE SOUTH WIND VERY PRIMITIVE BUT IT GAVE THEM SOME IDEA OF THE WATHE WIND I MEANOTHER THING M YOU COULD TELL THE WAY THE WIND WAS BLOWING JUST LOOK AT THE ENSIN WHICH WE ALWAYS HAD TO FLY THE WHITE ENSIN AND WE HAD TO ABIDE BY THE COLOURS OF THE WHITE ENIN PUT IT UP AT SUNRISE AND DOWN AT SUNSET O THE ENSIN WAS ALWAYS FLYING SO YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHICH WAY THE WIND AS GOBLOWING WITHOUT THE CONE BUT IT WAS A GALE FORCE WIND U PUT THE CONE UP WHICH SOMETIMES MEANT THE COMBE WAS UP FOR DAYS BECAUSE THE GALES WOULD BLOW UP THERE WINDY ND SOMETIMES WE WOULD HAVE TO BE LASHED ON TO THE TEN INCH BY OUR OPO BECAUSE IT WAS SO WINDY YOU KEPT BEING BLOWN AWAY T IT WAS VERY VERY COLD VERY WE WERE ALWAYS WET BUT WE DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER GEVA BATH OR A SHOWR UP THERE WHEN WE WENT BACK HOW LONG WOULD YOU BE SITUATED UP THEREWELL THE NIGHT WATCH WAS A LONG ONE WE'UD GO ON SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT O'CLOCK AND COME OFF AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING THAT WAS A VERY LONG ONE THE OTHER WATCHES PRETTY WELL FOUR HOURS ON AND FOUR HOURS OFF BUTTHE NIGHT WATCH IT WAS A TOUGH ONE AND YOU HAD TO WALK THERE AND BACK FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO WALK WE COULDWE OBJECTED BECAUSE THE MAN MNIN THE ESDIC STATION DOWN BELOW US GOT TRANSPORT THE SAME WATCHES OH WELL YES O THEN THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD ISSUE US WITH BICYCLES WHICH THEY DID WE HAD A WREN OFFICER CAME UP TO SEE US AND HE SAID THIS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND THEN THEY SUPPLIED TRANSPORT FOR US SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK THE NIGHT WATCH BACKWARDS AND FORWDS THREE OR FOUR MILES IN THE PITCH DARK ALONG ALL THE COAST ROAD BUT FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO BEFORE THEY REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING THAT'S AMAZING ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK YOU HEAR AUT THAT THE DUKE OF YORK WE NEVER HAD THE VERY BIG SHIPS THE BIGGEST SH ESCORT SHIP THAT EVER REALLY CAME INTO US WE DESTROYERS OR OR COVCOVETTES BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS USED TO GO INTO MUL TO WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS TO GO BACK OUT SO WE NEVER REALLY HAD ANYTHING WHAT I WOULD CALL VERY LARGE I WAS ON WATCH WITH STEPHNEY ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION IF YOU CAN PICTURE ISLANDS AND THE SEA AND SUDDENLY YOUD SEE A GREAT BIG CROSS ANCHOR CROSS MAST COMING ACTUAL THINKING WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE WE HAD NO TA FOR ANYTHING WE HAD NOTHING WHATEVERITING IT WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY OU K IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER WOU COULDN'T BELIEVE IT COSE WE CALLED IT UP NO REPLY OURSE THAT WAS WORRYING NO REPLY CAUSE IT WAS A SPECIAL ERY HOUR IT CHANGED CALL UP SINCHANGED ON THE CODE BOOK SO YOU WOULD CALL THEM UP BY THE CODE WHICH FOR THE DAY NO REPLY WE HAD A LITTLE SHIP WE HAD TWO SHIPS ACTUALLY ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN STAR ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN WAVE AND THEY WERE PATROL SHIPS WHICH USED TO PATROL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AMONG THE CONVOYS ALL THE TIME THEY WERE OLD WHAT I WOULD CALL SOMETHING LIKE A CORVETTE I THINK THEY WERE OLD TRAWLERS THEY WERE MANNED BY NAVY THEY WERE IF ANY TROUBLE WE CALLED THEM UP IMMEDIATELY AND EN WE CALLED UP THE SOUTHERN STAR SHE WAS WAY OUT OVER A MILE AND ASKED HER WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHE SAID I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING FROM HERE BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE IN A WAY WAYBUCS SAD I'LL GO AND INVESTIGATE SHE SAID IF IT'S NTHINGN TROUBLE I'LL PUT A SHOT ACROSS ITS BOWS THAT ANYWAY THIS THING GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER EVENTUALLY I MANAGED TO CALL UP OBVIOUSLY THE BUNTING TOSSER THAT'S WHAT VISUAL SIGNALS ARE CALLED BUNTING TOSSERS WAS ASLEEP I SHOULD THINK HE THOUGHT WEE ONLY CARUISING AROUND THESE ISLANDS DHE CAME BACK QUICKLY WITH DFWY INSTEAD OF PENNAT NUMBER BECOUSE ALL SHIPS HAVE PANET NUMBERS EITHER THE PENNET NUMBER OF THE SHIP OR THE COD WECAME BACK WITH NOTHING QUICKLY DAND I SAID TO STEPANA DODUKE OF YORK IT'S A BATTLESHIP I SAID BASE DON'T KNOW SO WE QUICKLY PHONED OUR BASE AND THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE US ECAUSE NOBODY HAD GOT ON TA ANYWAY HE CAPTAIN OF TEOUR CAPTAIN HEBASE CAME RUSHING DOWN TOOK HIM ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO GET TO US BY WHICH TIME SHE WAS IN FULL VIEW MASSIV BAIT JUST FILLED UP THE WHOLE OF THE BAY I' NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT AND OF COURSE TIRE WAS A GREAT BIG HOHAR ABOUT THIS WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW OF COURSE SHE WAS ONSHE WAS ON PILGRIMAGE UP TO NORWAY AFTER THE RMSHARNHORST SHEWAS DOING THIS TO I SUPPOSE SHE THOUGHT OH WE'VE GOT TIME TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DID IT THEY WERE A WAY OFF COURSE MEA NOTHING WUSHE MUST HAVE KNOWN THE WAYVERY WELL BECASE IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS OUT THERE BUT SHE DID SHE CAME RIGHT PAST US SAILING JUST OFF MULL IMEAN I COULD SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE SHE WAS WELL THAN THAT SHE JUST APPEARED BEHIND THE ISLANDS AS IF IT WAS ON SOME KIND OF A FILM IT WAS INCREDIBLE ANDITAS SORT OF THING YOU A DREAM ABOUT LOVELY STORY LOVELY STORY NOBODY EVER REALLY AGAIN ND TO KNOW WE NEVER EVER REALLY FOUND OUT BT WE REALISED AFTERWARDS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT WE WASE ON HOUR WAY UP TO THE BATTLE IN NORWAY DRINK OF TEA PLEASE D DAY OH YES WHEN D DAY CAME WE HAD ALL THE SHIPS WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY LOOKED SO DREADFUL THEY WERE ALL SORT OF BATTERED SHIPS WE THOUGHT WELL WD SEEN SOME AWFUL SIGHTS UTHERE WERE ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY OF THEM I SHOULD THINK WITH TWO DESTROYERS DURBAN AND SOMETHING ELSE N THE WAS THE DURBAN MAYBE I'VE WRITTEN MAYBE SHE' MENTIONED THEM IN THE BOOK ANYWAY AND WE THOUGHT GOSH O DESTROYER DOESN'T IT W OWAS A TERRIBLE STATE SURELY THE NAVY KNOW THEWE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE THEY CAME IN I SUPPOSE THEY WERE IN ABOUT A WEEK OR MORE THAN THAT TEN DAYS ENOUGH TIME FOR STEPHENIY TO GET TO KNOW THIS SIGNAL MAN THE SAID IT MUST BE TEN DAYS WE STILL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WERE IN SUC A AND WHY THEY DIDTBECAUSE THEY ONLY EVER STAYED FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS BUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A LONG TIME AND WE THOUGHT LOW SOMETHING OMETHING'S GOING ON THEN ALLWE WERE TOLD WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO POST ANY MORE LETTERS ALL OUR LETTERS WERE TO BE CANCELED ALL HOUR POSTAGE OUT WAS TO BE CONCELLED EVERYTHING GOING OUT FROM THE BASE WAS TO BE STOPPED ANWEERE ALL LEAVE WULD STOPPED AND WE THOUGHT SOMETHING'S IN THE AIR YOU YOU GET THAT FEELINWE THOUGHT WHERE ARE THEY GOING WHAT ARETHER GOING TO DO OF COURSE THEY WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS UM U NIGHT BEFORE D DAY THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT OR SO THEY SAID THE NIGHT BEFORE ALL SEEMED TO BE GETTING READY THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG SHIP CAME ALONGSIDE SOME OF THEM AND TOOK OFF A LOT OF STUFF AND WE THOUGHT THEY DON'T USUALLY UNLOAD HERE IT GOES TO GUROK AND GRENOCK WHERE THEY WERE UNLOADING ALL SORTS OF STUFF AND WE WATCHED THEM THROUGH THE TELESCOPE CHAIRS AND TABLES AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS WERE COMING UP WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS NEXT DAY WHEN WE CAME UP ON WATCH THEY WERE ALL BUSY GETTING READY TO GO OUT AND WE HAD NO EXPECTED TIME OF DEPARTURE AT ALL THEY ALL JUST SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR PATROL SHIPS HAD NO IDEA THEY SAID WHAT DO WE DO WHET THEY'RE GOING WHAWE HADN WE COULDN'T TELL THEM OF COURSE IT WAS SO SECRET AND THAT'S THE END OF THE DDAY THAT WAS ALL THE BLOCK SHIPS GOING DOWN THEY WERE ROTTEN OLD SHIPS HAT NOBODY WANTED THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD BEEN SO BATTLE SCARRED THAT THEY WERE ALMOST UNSINKABLE SO THEY WERE THE TWO BIG BLOCKSHIPS AND THESE WERE SENT DOWN TO HELP OUT WE NEVER EVER HEARD UNTIL THE END OF THE WAR WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT THEE OBVIOUSLY THE WERE THE BLOCKSHIPS THING YOU TOUCHED ON EARLIER BUT I'D LIKE MORE CLARIFICATION ON IT S STHE CONVOYS ESSENTIALLY YOU DID TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTATION CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN AGAIN FOR ME YOU KOW HOW PROCESS A DISPATCH RIDER WOULD ARRIVE FROM BASE FOR THE STATION HOTEL WHICH IS THEIR BASE A STATCH BRIDER WOULD ARRIVE WITH A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH WOULD CONTAIN T OF THE NEXT CONVOY COMING IN AD RIHT SO YOU'D THEN GET IT OUT PUT IT IN FRONT OF YOU PUT IT UP AND
