what about what about when you started see you know military casualties the being of bombast and stuff and you how is that i did it well em as ashore first death in ireland there was a there as a later there was a lad in a coma must mean about three days or something and then they then they even well he was on life's support and on the ad to cut that off course there was it had done a lot of damage inside him and em then so ose was my first death i'd seen and i just i just went i just burst into tears and said why is this happening and things like that and i had to be consoled by the sergeant and it was unusual for me because i with me it's difficult for me to show any emotion more saw now anywhere with the my difficulties and that and er and show any sign of any tears or whatever cos basle i mean in the army they would have called you names anywhere of all sorts if you bercy sort of broke down a ever said percy em even or thinking about it now on hind sighted sir it's it's a normal reaction really even even with men even though if you're in the army it's busy you're not supposed to show any any signs of emotion however he supposed to just get on with your job and that i ask what you trained for what i was sort of as thinking of getting out there was that you know you you you've gone into the army you've done some training am you know essentially you're then you're in a theatre it's all quite an interesting and exciting process but then all of a sudden you are seeing the realities of a of a wars earn and stuff and i just wondered how that was with you when you saw a young man coming in injured well i just i just got on with it to be honest i mean them em out in our training when they give us scenarios to base deal with an alison the triage system where you god sir where you got to deal with the four bees breathe and bleed in bricks and burns that's the priorities unless it's in a nuclear biological chemical warfare situation then the prouty threes become priory ones been the ones come out or threes because in a chemical a biological chemical situation that it's highly likely that the pretty ones aren't going to survive if they got all these these chemical agents or biological agents in them as well as well as the wounds and that am so in in a war in the depot and at these they give you sinaros and these to make there used to shout at you and all this lot to see how you got on to see if you panic analyst saw by that by that happening it i'd put you in good stead or put me in good stead anyway and how long were you in ireland for a did you axle did you have to go out on australia where you live you just fate nor i went on a second to her back in nineteen eighty one when bobby sands was on hunger strike am with a few others in the merest prison we were called out i was with a e but the call spear head battalion i was with her i was in a section attached to this battalion as an extra battalion to go out there because we're expecting lot lots of trouble and so i i was out a whole is on the streets i was i was in i was in north howard street in the first place the mill and not but then i was busy em and of being attached to a mercy crash team in a mccrory park which is just off the falls road white rock bit of a rough area and so i used to go out in the in the armored ambulances sarasin or a or a pig humber pig are going out in them so we were basely in this sort of a in this camp in the middle of this sort of a built up area of houses and the main park itself a marry park it which was next to the busy building and that so so as i was bears there then we went out to in the middle of belfast one time for em am i think it was bernadette devlin mccluskey because he was back on the streets again after she was saved by british soldiers her and her husband and am so i was outside of bpa city center with our ambulance but er the ant been fairly quiet anywhere i had enough to deal with any casualties thank goodness but i've been called to other places as well other camps anywhere with the ambulance an ad but we did get the odd there was paint thrown at the vehicles even the level got red crosses on words i've seen some people don't take any notice of the red cross or what are the red crescent or anything really like that and we had these two kids through this this push chair at us one time when we're coming up the gate so that's eighty one and then i get to eighty two and then opposites jane a bit and so just what were you when did you first become aware of a place called the falklands well i was a stamp clatter for some years i know i knew where the falklands was even though i knew some some soldiers that thought the falklands was up in scotland and that so so i was quite aware of the falklands and that then where it was a beforehand some of them said always in scotland i said no is and it's down the south at south atlantic i said there was the as a battle of the falklands in the first world war as well and where did you become aware that there was stuff going on down there there there that might be on your radar when we were we were on a we had so many dears stand by in the first place or we knew it was imminent was coming up unless obviously the politicians had solved it beforehand but em we er i was still in aldershot that am i was an old shot at them mons barracks and we were seen at seeing what was happening all the time in the falklands cause we didn't leave till me but of put the e the parrots and the commandos had gone down there in the april not long after the invasion so er we we saw some men saw the ships being the coventry in the sheffield and that were hit before we we got down there and so when did you know so we thought it was realistic then em where was round about yes round about this time thirty two years ago now was her i was on easter holidays but we had to leave our our sort of contact details and we're on so so many hours notice then we were loud to go home on easter leaving that and then i got a call to go i got a call back so to go back earlier and that so it went from a from my easter holiday to go back to camp to say on seventy two hours stand by to go and then he went then the next minute we're on a on a couch goin to southampton to join the ship and up and i went to see the went on board the nordic ferry which was a town in torres on ferry where did that take you took all widen there he it was a roll on roll off ship it was only got it goes from hall to zeebrugge and that the same with the baltic which was the sister ship these these two red and white ships like come down even or we had to black out the portals and every these and ye took us all way down there we stopped off in freetown seale on first and wave off to replant get replenishment and wave even eat all these canoes on the sat or tall canoes at the side of the ship thrown trying to put sales stuff and whatever these ivory sort of masks and everything else and am yes i went down there yet we did the cross novus ceremony of the of the the quarter in art not to get every ship was to do light anywhere a what was it what was the light life like that was a owen you went when you were handing down at what was your birth like and what were you were you starting i was a as i was in the em we we we were in the year we're in some cabins in the first place here but my plate my my beds bed area was the shower and that and then and then i was put into the galley on the seats that go round the table i saw the managed to screen that off but bercy when people get up in the morning and whatever you can hear all the noises so you what you you walk awake in no time and a but they kept us active because all the supplies were put on on the ship willy nilly cause it was a rush you say to get everything on board so so the got got all all of us base kit was occupied by vasily moving things backwards and forwards met in the corridor to get to the rations and the ammunition and all this log and we had helicopters on board and everything else as well gazelles and then i was doing flying stations i was medical cover for that so i had to wear a anti flash gear the hood and the gloves and that had to wear them with firm with the joint service helicopter handling unit used to take stores off helicopters coming down that to use a rod anywhere to earth it so i didn't get electrocuted and then take out take all the packages down and i was there with them as as medical cover and then there was a fire party as well in case the helicopters cos percy the army air corps were often problems they'd never flown off a ship before or landed on a ship and if it's stormy in the gn at an angle it's even worse for them to try to land him whether how were your sea legs not too bad really not
