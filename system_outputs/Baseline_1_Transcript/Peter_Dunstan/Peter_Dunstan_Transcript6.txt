so you've headed on to sing a pool what can you remember of them and it was there any anticipation about what you were you re facing no we you get well i remember we we've seen past a seen past singapore town and up into the up into the dockyard ah i've i've actually been back and i've actually got photographs i've got a photograph somewhere that the prince of wales tied up in the navy dockyard in singapore and when i organized one of the first groups of prisoners were back as a tour guide and we got back and we went into the dockyard and i got a photograph of exactly the same position that the prince of wales was in so you had from singapore down to malay is that right am well we were the prince where there was a report came in from the army that there was a japanese invasion up around the era of code baru which is the north the north of mali and as there as the report was that there was a japanese invasion fleet there they dispatched the prince wales and repulse to get in amongst them and sort him out but it was a complete trap because the japanese had accumulated god knows how many a twin engine bombers inside gone and of course as we got up in towards a canton and that of mala we were well within their range and of course as soon as soon as we got in their range the japanese went for us and they were they were coming at us a at about ten twelve aircraft at a time five at one side and five at the other side so it didn't matter which way you turned you you steered the ship you were running into their torpedoes and the first torpedo of the japanese hit the prince of wales on the port after a it was the we had four propellers two on each side and the the the torpedo hit the ship just forward of the innate in a a propeller and he bentley bent the shaft a twelve inch diamond shaft the explosion bent the shaft and it ripped the back end of the prince alas open and of course we went down we went down to an angle of about fifteen degrees straight away with the amount of water that flooded in there i think i think some of the the um boffins of the reckon that there was about ten thousand gallon of water hit the flooded prince wales in about thirty seconds well of course a in view of the fact that we were that badly damaged that we were starting to sink they gave the order to abandoned ship and the sergeant who was in charge of our gun orders on to the folks the front of the ship counted us out found that he got the whole of the romain crew and then ordered us to jump or to abandon ship rather and i can i i can recall there was a rope there and i went down the rope so far caught my foot in one of the port holes in the side of the ship and just sort of gave myself a push and let go and dropped and it's been calculated it was seventy feet from the from the time i let go of the rope to the water i told people to day that i won't even jump in the bath is too deep but then we swam the navy have two or three different types of a rescue and one of them is what they call a carly float which is a great big what ten ten feet in those days it was ten feet a square mat with floats placed every about a foot away from it from each other as a rescue float i know i got got on to hang on to the side of that we with a load of other chaps we pushed it and that towards the destroyer and climbed up aboard the destroyer and which was one of our three escort destroyers and after that we would take him back to singapore what was it like to be you know that i mean you talked before about being hit by show you didn't feel it did you did you instantly know were you in your gunnery position did you instantly know that this was a major hit well yes because of the angle that the angle that she she developed and although i was in as saying the in the transfer room a below deck a immediately i mean the the a and the shape and that of the room i mean was such that you knew it was over and the sagan in charge of the gunryars as they ordered us aboard to evacuate and abandon ship what was it like when you er in the water i mean we could you see all these japs buzzing around and oh no no the japs the japs knew that they got us and they they they in fact one flight did come over and they signaled to the destroyer i can remember this piece a distinct the the japanese signal to the destroyer to cease fire and pick up survivors and this was told over the tannoy of the of the destroyer that that and the coast of japan the our own destroyer was picking up survivors and we were tiger back to singapore which destroyer was it a i'm not sure whether it is the destroyer express or the destroyer electra there was the express the electra and the tenadus the side three destroyers the tenetus was an australian a destroyer but i i'm not sure at this present moment in time which one it was it could have been the express what was it like did you actually see the the the prince of wales go under oh yes yes what was all i mean you spent a night you know a good year on it the only thing i can remember is the fact that i was a well away from him because you knew that when a ship sinks i mean the the undertow will take you down as well and there were the number of us were who were hanging on to the side of this a cork float we were pushing it away and one or one of the chaps said now yelled she's going and she she turned completely over can remember these funny enough talking about this to you i can remember these sort of things she took completely over and you could hear the the guns the the big fourteen inch guns there were three three sets of them the weight of those turrets they were just dropping out of the out of the ship because they weren't anchored down i mean the the weight of the naval gun i mean is such that it rolls around on bearings and that and once she's upside down men they just fall out when you got on to whichever the destroyers it was did you know is when you became aware that you had lost some of your a mess when you know you you were just thankful that you were you were aboard the you know a rescue ship it wasn't until we got back to singapore and even then we didn't know until the romarines now can't remember exactly what happened there but to when she got back to singapore at the prince of wales remains were detailed off as guard to the singapore naval wales station and the post romarins were detailed to guard the navy stores in the a roaming docket ron navy dockyard so it was only then and even then i don't think we we really had a a am a roll call of exactly who was missing it is until i've been doing this research now that i've i know who a who we lost because of the dates of dates given of death
