just explain your relationship with the trumpeter um well i met this chappy which is my um my husband eventually um at one of the dances in the drill hole and every time he came in i knew i had a date that night so and then he went with a crowd of them so if he wasn't ashore one of the other would come and take us girls out the only time that um gwen who's always clean shaven but you know that the navy's not allowed to just grow a moustache they must have a set so the number of didn't you know that oh yes you can't have just a moustache now the airforce you know they could grow the big moustaches but you've got to get permission to grow a set and of course when they went to artic convoys of course it would have been the thing to do you grow a set because otherwise you know pretty cold shaving every day wouldn't it and he only grew a set once and then he when he was he shaved off the beard and kept the moustache and then my mother said to him one day 'i don't like you with that' so he shaved it off he didn't shave it off for me but he shaved it off for my mum he also was the trumpeter was also on um a convoy to malta and i haven't got that photograph because again my um great niece has got it as they were coming back from malta they called in at gibraltar and their eating bananas because of course there were no bananas here to be had so they were showing off i think four of them in the picture all tucking in to these bananas so they were not only on the russian convoys but um they did the malta one anyway and they were also on the atlantic what was your feeling when he went off to see to do the convoys do you remember i don't think that i ever thought anything could happen that is the i'm sure i didn't well i know i didn't you know 'i'll see you next time when you're back' i never thought of it being that dangerous although obviously it was how close did you feel the war was sometimes well i i think that the one of the things that brought it home to me after d day was because i'd got one of the americans i used to write to him that it wasn't that he was a boyfriend as such you know what i mean but a friend and he was of german extraction and another one was of italian extraction now isn't this strange that they're fighting against the italians and the germans it was funny but marvin he was the one that was killed in belgium and i had one of my letters returned and it wasn't until that point because i hadn't known anybody else that had been killed and it wasn't until that point that i realised just how bad it was and then i had his he must have told his mother that i was his girlfriend well i suppose i was a girlfriend but i wouldn't say i was the girlfriend if you know what i mean and she sent me i've got it there actually she sent me things as well so poor old marvin but i was just reading this morning he was born in twenty nine i think it was twenty nine i was born in twenty i didn't think he was that much younger but still and you mention it then d day did your work increase up to d day oh there was yes yes there was always a lot of um action going on busy switchboard etcetera on d day but at hatston now again we didn't do a lot of um parade work but we did go on divisions one day um you'd be nominated and very rarely we were on there but the captain in charge at the chap in charge believe it or not didn't like wrns in the old lisle stockings you know the thick lisle stockings he only liked them in the silk stockings so well instead they'd be rayon really i don't suppose they'd be pure silk well they weren't pure silk i do know that and so only wrns that had silk stockings could go on parade
