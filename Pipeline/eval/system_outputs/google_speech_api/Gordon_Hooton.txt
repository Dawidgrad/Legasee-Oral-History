the home gun for that one of the best shops that have with with with a rifle laura machine going up on here right here and i run away from home to a lot of evening what have you got the place where we had it which is now gone and you know the water drill me some here so i just left home and had a bit of a struggle to get into the navy because i want you know the housework they would have liked but anyway don't know i put me into the ganges at the other lads all been just sent up a wall across the water to the isle of man because they were being bombed uc and i was the only one that went in as as a word and came out at the end and i don't well you know i did not been in the home guard younger man and i don't know what machine gun in and throwing and everything in the explosives in by the moon throwing me nothing why did you enjoy it so much what are longer because soon as i got there the first thing you have to do you have to put a wetsuit on and you have to say the lengths of the pond and back until you can do that you don't get away when i was a good side i've not used to be a diving board and red hot adult with internet and consequently i'll be straight out and how to do a little couple of little runs up to scott and and do some work out the area of the chaps and one way or another always seem to be doing jobs on little boats back and forward up to scotland and what have you sent us we're doing it and lexi non zero decided i would be in the chat and i decided i would study a bit in there i don't know in the home guard i don't know what i'm working and machine gun in wellingborough thought i was a very fit man anyway when you pass what we want you want to do when you leave there i wanted to be a torpedine see so i joined the torpedo and actually didn't really suit me and i tried got in there that didn't but anyway i've got in and got out and then another chap sat with me we both passed out and went into jobs in the dockyard basement until we got a ship and soon as i masturbate a little bit in the dockyard doing work and there and then the savage she was down on the where will the trouble were down south she came flying back because she was desperately needed to go and up to them and run and they in the chat don't worry now we both got picked up and took up to scapa flow and help with it and then one out the other up there a member of the chatham dockyard what was it like as a place for young boy well i was a young i thought that everything was wonderful how's your order serveon i mean i actually did the first thing i did it because the savage hasn't come up then she was down just finishing down at the the battle and they sent me in the dockyard to do a job until the ship come up and was in that submarine submarine which was in dried up that had full do germans in the spaniards when they put that dead body over there in the chance to win them remember it well i folded the germans that it was a german that would been they actually put a body they got a dead man's body for genuine dead man and i put it into this submarine and i actually dress it all up as a man trying to take information to the spaniards in the coastline in a uniform not nice service uniform ben enclosure nana and they put the thing on his arm with great big attache case with all tell me information on what was happening pretty supposed to be a german spies station com it's a film it's fantastic anyway that little submarine that i had to go and work i'm just come back from taking the body and floating it in the in the spanish coastline to drip a short address them all up as as one of them there so you know and it all worked for the first time when you're at your first proper draught but i'll tell you what it were she was down on the battlefront interior called away because she was needed for this and we were done it to work in the doctor in the daytime and then fitters in the in the canteen at night and anyway we got four and we both got told to get it already in the dockyard and the savage came in from being down on the bank where the fighting and she's been pulled right up with loading her up with stuff and that alongside and we got cold and put a border and we've that but i'll tell you the bloke that was when he died not bad three weeks ago and we both again you said we both took the course together and everything we still together and we both got put under the savage she came in and in the afternoon and pulled alongside and got it was it with murder they haven't they all sorts of things because we got a race up with this big convoy work from canada and i'm already there was loads up your scotland waiting for the congo the movie war and this is how we do it anyway for us to and we went on to the window where they tell you where you're going and i sent us straight to the savage in the dockyard and what was the sandwich was having to do with take on and everything out and it was pouring a bloody rain at night and we had to go down further down the coast because this we joined it when we went on we were there forever we've been drafted to her which was alright but went down to it when it goes dark went down to the emanation place which was a long way down water from us and he was bucketing down and god long will be amination ship in the in the dark and it was not pipes boards and i was bringing up and down carrying stuff out for around a pitch black and the ship was shipping water it was so raining so hard anyway we're all carrying stuff up along the bit you know to feel a lot with lamination and that i'm from there at midnight through the between ireland and on this a big convoy i know you'll never see it ryan like it in pitch black because we had to put all new amination on and off or we could sell from there cos that with the ammunition bunkers down there anyway be good up in the early hours in the morning we reached liverpool and had area and then it's saturday lineup of it but never left off driving rain and we went right up to the northway regarding this condyle and i will more less ready the sale thought it was the biggest con by the wall and every type of ship was there and regina and i mean i've never been the bloody silly you don't know where you were because we haven't been trained for it every too quick but anyway with my man is the first thing you are all mixed up because the ship shipping water all the way up and i went down into the front for the ship and it was for a bloody water and it keeps ringing from one side to the other it was shipping it over the top you'll see it would have been the worst storms of the war that running up that coast under but anyway how are you i don't mind i'm eating it i felt so bloody sick going up to russia too bad going up through the channel as i said when we actually got going i thought i got billeted we had they haven't got room for standing there the name place and northover the dog so i clear me aside for my love and they've got the arctic tern forward looking foreign so that it was opened to the direction we were going on the back of the gum shield and it had curtains curtains that go over cos there's no doors on the on and i slept there all night i did the rest of the night cos i did feel ill and my mate he was somewhere else i don't know where he didn't went but i will never speak again well i wasn't sick then i felt sick but i will never like it again but always been a good swimmer and diver good it don't even but that should upset me like that i didn't know but i stopped up there until we got two days away from and i never look there the savage was a one of ship she wasn't got a depth under water like the old up and down engine ones she had she had electric turbines steam turbines made electric but she didn't draw half as much under the water as an ordinary destroy or an ordinary sleep which was proved last day of the war and we've all that waiting around outside to go through the mountains gap into into the russian end panda the u boat was waiting for us and we're all there and the convoy was coming in cliffe bottoms and you could only go into the dockyard through an entrance not much wider than that with two great pillars of coastline so you had a good one at a time and the big liberty ships used to squeeze through it and if this was the last convoy of the war and we were hanging out there ships are coming in with stuff to set taking and miss you both was laying under the rocks opposite us it was snowing in the morning when we took up a position to cover as a comment liberty ships with no we're railway engines on a minute from america and the first thing that happened when i'm going to torpedo as it went to go through the opening into the harbour you go further to it nobody can get through it broken off and song in the gateway what we called it again way because they are saying because the rest of the patella patella and the people we copy to bring up we're coming into this big opening where we were all waiting cigarette in and we will all ready for everything i will near my mate will put down below to push the name depth charges up will come on and then they were pulling about ready to go never coming home so i didn't but the others on decade that i could hear it coming but they didn't know it worse and it went under the savage and it the brand new ship just as far away as the other side of the road and everybody practicals on it's like brand new one but wouldn't it the savage shallow draught chalet drive she hasn't she had crap engines at with written by sharks that way not out the bottom and then these two generators for you had a good day one of my jobs i could end every morning and check all the things that could have stopped it and make sure everything was that was one of my jobs used to stand them what says what they were there's no propellers as they were on the biggest ships which were right load down one day when we had with evan it was only draw enough as much water is one of them and that torpedo went under us and it the other ship the other side and we picked them in a minute six week be buried fourteen we went in that we're fighting till dark at they're all the rest of this ships and this liberty ship hit it with a torpedo and it blocked the entrance you see that it went down in the entrance remember i don't know because it was up to the russians to do the homework and they're so we were fighting until dark at night and it was in the morning when we started and it got dark and we find we buried once it was quite dusk getting dark and we buried him right up north further to come in another way from the north and they're inside the water because we couldn't get in to see what was the terrible if you don't ask envoy and when we came out they don't know that the russians and it was christmas first me back christmas day there panda and when we come out we could come out that way we came out at midnight two of us we had a go north coast line and the other one when we went save near the moment north listening for u boats and while we were there we were dropping the convoy was ready to come out that was coming out already to come out and represent each way person the other one to keep anything down you see and try and find anything was him what we doing this to convoy came out in the pitch black and by the time it get light in the morning they were well away from where we were so we had a scratch oven casserole pc and which we did and became i'm alright never had no problems well i stayed on the on the savage until the german surrender and we came back down to chatham chelsea barracks in the dockyard and i was sent for because she say i was a volunteer hi john underage hence it made me of volunteer not a conscript in man but came down to the chatham dockyard i got sent to the place with edith you in and out and i had to thank me kids and the next morning i was put on a train with hundreds more in a dockyard locked him he is now taking me and this train went straight offline down to southampton we go down bloody great line are there waiting for us all full of people going to the far east and we going to say that eight hundred and thirty and it would have a six in and you couldn't get on anyway for people it was a bloody great american liner can thinking then i never to honour them mate but anyway yeah wish out that night within two hours we're on the water doing out and ride out to salon and that's where we took over there don't know where she went from there because she was loaded to the top with we had a stop at four we can go through the canal to get out to get out to the bottom and you know we got there with peterborough and went went onto near down the next morning through the canal but she was just a big ship and the next thing we went out of salon and that's where i bumped it off oh no they want no bloody room for us we had be on the top deck and it was blowing a gale and dumped only got loads of women on there in uniform in that we had a sleep on the top deck we went to the canal and brought out then straight out to see alarm and i dumped us one minute hearing that still on and they had two on them i had a sip sliding feeling what it might be like i don't i didn't i wanted it you see that's why i run away and join the navy young i wanted the navy and when that all came on top of the world she was a nice ship but i've never done any minesweeping then i think i'm not into chatham music for everybody else we going on or gave sapphire but there's one bro and he was in the same message me he used to sit at the table and i don't know why you took a talk to me but anyway if i found out that i would have chatham man and that was what i think started it shouldn't have been there really but everybody else they will bricks together but he may be used to go down to sleep below if we if we want any danger we just open allo down the you down there you've got another mistake and you and your amex down here if you can and he was in the same message me sitting opposite me an energy source used to sneer at me and i never had a brilliant day or night shift and maybe she quartermaster didn't like that because i give me a call around as a ship and then the captain you had a chat with me and tell me what it like meeting and i was in charge of the sterridge which means that the other taps are under me straight away devastated bloody ship but i got a compass like you when you see they are going to know you got numbers backwards and forwards and you had a read them and but we did have one what about this ship the japanese ship that you were escorting tell me about that yeah well that was the biggest sinking and don't ask me the name i can't tell you but it was the biggest one they had been bombed and she lay in the album goodbye forever tell me when in and out but we thought she was on the bottom but she wasn't but anyway it was a biggest one of the japanese ships and have been bombed and been in singapore harbour for quite some time since it was it and but anyway i'm in no no they were making it ready to tow it and think it and we got chose to do it and we were coming on our way home i said happened and if we left singapore with her to talk with actually and she was a massive ship and she been emptied and everything and it got dark and we're coming up the malacca straits and we got to this point where we supposed to be sung the day bridgwater chrissy with the biggest one i had at the time and consequently it was pitch black and we're on our way coming to come home you see it come to zero and two japanese dogs with toner had been towing her far away from us ferdinand that they were promised but never coming up again the coastline and we were further out where we could get her on everything how does the saying got pitch black and by the time we got to the points which we had a compass reading we got a singer on i started the ship coming up and left her about it and left the ship with no headway and she come halfway up nearly two ways to close the bean song and i respect i don't know what are captain got permission to sing good but it's a zero pitch black and we had a searchlight hanna and they don't listen to the black and gotten because his whippet she got she wouldn't do it for a massive here but she's only just not the coastline as we pitch black and i'm still on the bloody whale i am records looking at the wheelhouse while it cos we won't go in with just and being i suppose the captain god in their people and they said what to do so we had to send men over with depth charges because we carried depth charges and i got to put the depth charges the lowest possible in the ship because there's nobody on there and i made it were massive and had got it wore everything up and we could do with you there depth charges and that's all we could do well we did we did it midnight when we started and we were drifting as far away as his first sales from them under because you couldn't do much really cos i have a motor boat made over and they took i think i put four depth charger dinner in the motorboat and that's all she told you see carrie and so they took them over from my fav us aircrew you so you doing it and whatever they done i went aboard the ship and i took these depth charges as the captain that said it got to be done and write down in the lone ranger's they could get all the ship because i miss you what a bloody massive seeing and i did everything i couldn't foods everything but would makes road and came back to us and bang she did she went down the bottom now and she went down because we never see no more cos we left it there whether she she want to further after coat and she went too far from fine the ship one going up towards bintang and oh yeah we are searching yeah until we see him or less but you still going to still going down she pitched are men put all the way along so when she got to the certain depth i don't the depths of the bottom of the ship to let the water in as you do and we had to sit there until you feel anton four days charging me when ready can never see how low key fabulous you with one camera so sweet what you do how you do it you can do it you can do it floats on different ways you can put depths down for them down to certain depth and leaving their way to them down it depends what's going to be there over him that when you come back but basically you only do it declare the ocean in the area in and it has been shipped colliding with them we get some we get sent out there to sweep it reminds well we've had him come up beside us together we are strong wires you're in a formation like that an hgv driver goes out to another and another one and then you've got seven but you're the one in the front and it's probably more equipment that you can sound in them and the others they do that sort of thing they keep improving on certain things and we may have been a little bit better i don't know but that's how you sweet that's why you're all over latch each other so it's all done free they bring they had to sit there one each side of you at the certain distance and then vice a versa for the next year that's when you do it that typer sweep but there are other ways you can you can sweep and some for you seduce white sweet for the longer is rihanna great big thing on there quarterdeck and it was heavy wire and we yusuf let that out with things on that you know and captain on the bridge it's a let go then you stop it when he tells you it's a massive so stuck on a drum and it's not any wire but you put anything on the end of it you see if you can get it out and it will explode mind or it would be defined as any day you know where you stand a little bit better if you were still done unlock really is you can't look down in the sea but we use the snag up on we stand up on an aeroplane then they're crashed whatsapp we were told it well don't know i never seen her tweet i know when it snagged it and got rid of shit but it was a plane when i don't know who they know because we didn't stop but you've got somebody that makes something up didn't you tell me what happened we come home to england and i had the our most of the time and because i used to go to take over because i responsible for nec so so they didn't have a long thing i just take it you seeing help and one night as that doing i don't have to be a quartermaster which means when we had anchor i had to do a duty at the back of the ship where the where they come in and have it may be with you and all the logbook say and everything and i was on duty they're doing mine and we were almost coming home at this point terrible throat and cold and it was pouring around and i had a text then i watch and i thought mum i've got feeling cold now hasn't my locker because they've been there since i put him in for we
