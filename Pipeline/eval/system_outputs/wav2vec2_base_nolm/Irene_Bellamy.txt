SODBURY AND I LIVED IN SHIPSING SODBURY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AN AND THAT WAS QUITE GOOD FUN OUT HE THE SORT OF VILLIAN'S LIFE LOKS GOING ON BUT IHAD ALWAYS HAD A YEN TO GO INTO THE NAVY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT AT MAINLY CAUSE I HAD FRIENDS WHO HAD A JOINED THE SERVICES AND WAS IT WAS IT RENS OVER ANY OTHER SERVICE YE I DIDN'T WANT TO JOINT YOU MEAN E ENOUGH FOR WAS YES OR NO NO NO THAT MY PARTICULAR FRIEND WENT INTO THE WIRE AND SHE HAD A VERY INTERESTING TIME AS OUT IN WASHINGTON A WORKING FOR THE MET NOT MABEL THE AIRFORCE THE REN WAS THE RIGHT SOICE YES YER LIKE THE UNIFORM TO YEAT YU SERDLE BUS ABOUT YATE IN WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE IN EMESTIST TE WORK INSELF AN WELL AM AS SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF DESIGNER IN THE BEGINNING AN IT WAS A QUESTION OF DOING AN TYPING HE WOULD DICTATE HIS DESIGN A REPORTS BECAUSE IT HAD ALL HAD TO GO UP TO THE AIR MINISTRY FOR APPROVAL A BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A AN ORDER FOR THESE PLANS OF COURSE AND IT WAS TYPING ALL THESE SHEETS OF DESCRIPTION OF THESE PLANES AN AND THAT I MEAN TO SAY HE WAS A VERY UNDISCIPLINED MAN IN THAT HE LEFT EVERYTHING TO THE LAST MINUTE SO ONE WAS WORKING QUIETLACE AT NIGHT VERY OFTEN TO GET IT DONE TO THE JED LINE THAT THE MINISTRY HAD SET OO BASIL HENDERSEN AND HE DESIGNED A SMALL PLAYING CALLEDLY AM WHAT DOES THEY CALL IT AM THE HENDY ET IT WAS A BREAK DOWN OF HIS NAME BUT IT WAS BASL HENLT AN IT'LL COME TO ME BUT IT WAS EM ROUND ABOUT THE TIME THAT THERE WAS A ANOTHER CHAP DESIGNING THOSE SMALL PLAINS AN I CAN'T THINK FOR HIS NAME NOW BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THE WAR WAS COMIN AM NOT REALLY NOW I MEAN TO SAY OT THE BOYS TIT WE USED TO MEET AND MIX WITH BUT WERE MOSTLE AM AIRFORCE TYPES OR GOING INTERESTED IN THE AIR FORCE AND WE KNEW THER LITTLE FIVE OR ONE SQUADRON THE AT PHILTAM AN THAT MOST OF THEM FLEW WITH AN AND WE KNEW AT TIMES THAT FROM THEIR CONVERSATION THAT THINGS WERE GETTING VERY NEAR BUT AM NOT REALLY YOU KNOW NOT YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T PUTTING OUT THE BARRICADES OR ANYTHING WOULD AOW THE OUTREAK OF WARD YOU REMEMBER I DO AWAN WE WERE AT ION FILTON ERADROME WITNEY THEN THAT SUNDAY WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED IT A WATCHING THESE LADS IN THEIR PLAINS TAKING OFF PURELY FOR EXERCISE CERTANY TID TS CHANGE IN BRISTOL WHEN WARBROGAN WHAT WAS THE CHANGE YOU REMEMBER I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY CAUSE MOST OF MY LIFE WERE SPENT BETWEEN FISHPONDS AND YAGHTS YOU KNOW I VERY RARELY WENT THE OTHER WAY TOWARDS TOWN AND DIDN'T REALLY GET ANY FEELING OF WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE AND EVEN YOU KNOW I READ NOW ABOUT SOME OF THE GHASTLY THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBING YOU KNOW THE LOSS OF LIFE AN BUT IT DIDN'T BUT AFFECT ME DIRECTLY AN MY PARENTS HAD A SHOP IN FISHPONDS AND THEY STIL KEPT GOING ALONE QUIET SORT OF WAY DID YOU SEE BIT YOU SEE WREU IN WEEAT E YES I WAS INTE EGED HERE AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FIRM MOVED US TO LIVE IN ATE SO THAT WE DIDNOT HAVE THE BUSINESS OF TRAVELLING AN BUT WE DID HAVE A DAYLIGHT RAIDIN IN YATE AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC AND THEY WERE THEY THEY SENT A SINGLE PLAIN AND THEY SAY WE WERE ALL WORKING AWAY QUITE HAPPILY IN THE AIRADS IRON WENT AND THE I WAS BEING TAUGHT HOW TO PLAY BRIDGE BY THE FRIEND WHO WENT INTO THE AIR FORCE AND THEM WE DIDN'T TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE ARETIRI TAT WE NEVER HAD ANYTHING AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS THE MOST ALMIGHTY EXPLOSION AND THE WHOLE BUILDING SHOOK AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED A SINGLE PLANE HAD COME IN APARENTLY IT CAME IN FROM SOMEWERE IN THE NORTHERN FRANCE ARIA WHERE THE GERMANS HAD AM ARPORT AND HAD FLOWN UP THE BRISTOL CHANNEL TO SOMEWHERE NORTH OF GLOUCESTER PICKED UP THE RAILWAY LINE AND YATE RUNS ALONG THE RAILWAY LINE IF YOU KNOW THE BUILDING AND FLEW DOWN AND DROPD THIS STRIP OF BOMBS ALONG THE FACTORY FORTUNELY A COUPLE OF THEM DIDN'T GO OFF AND I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SEEING A DEAD BODY BECAUSE I KNEW MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FACTORY BECAUSE OF WHOM I WAS WORKING FOR AND ONE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOUSE IN THE INTRIPING SOBBRY WAS AT WOMAN CALLED SISTER HOBBS WHO BECAME QUITE WELL KNOWN FOR THE WORK SHE DID IN THAT BLITZ AND SHE JUST GAUGHT HOLDOMIN SHE HAD COME ON WE'VE GOT TO GO UT TO THE BRICK FACTORY SHE SAID TO IDENTIFY THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED AND YOU KNOW I WAS TATEN WHAT AUGHT I IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE THOUGHT I TWENTY TWO AT TWENTY TWO TO SEE ALL THESE DISINTRIGRATED BODIES I HADN'T SEEN THE DEAD BODY BEFORE AND THAT WAS VERY TRAMATIC WAS THAT YOU THIN CATILIS TO THINKING I WANTED JOIN BECOME A RIN NO I DON'T THINK SO NTHAT WAS QUIETLY SIMMERING AWAY AND I THINK THE CATTLIST IN THE END WAS WHEN MY BOSS MOVED HE WENT TO A FOAM WHICH GAN YOU MAY KNOW OF BOOZY AND HAWKS THEY AN HE WASN'T A MUSICIAN OR HE HADN'T MADE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS CAS THAT WAS THE JOB THEY DID ORIGINALLY THEY WERE MAKING SPARE PARTS FOR SOME OF OUR GUNTORETS AND THEY AM FOUND THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD DESIGN WHAT THEY WANTED AND AM THEY GOT HIM AN THEY HAD HANTED HIM AND WHEN HE LEFT I WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH A PERSON WHO GOT THE JOB AND I THOUGHT I WANT TO MOVE BUT I HAD TO WORK QUITE HARD TO GET INTO THE RENTS BECAUSE OF COUSE I WAS IN RESERVED OCCUPATION I TO O ASK WAS ERE ISI SEED IT WAS A RESERVED OCCUPATION SEE YOU HAD TO GO THOUGH THE PROCEDURE TO GET OUT YES AND THEY WENT THE RENT WENT OPEN FOR RECRUITMENTS ANYHOW AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE BEING A A DRAWN I SUPPOSE IS HE WORD FOR THE BY WAR ARTIST A MAN CALLED LEOPOLD FREEDOM SO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RUN TO EARTH SINCE I'VE TRIED BECAUSE HE DID LIKE A MURAL OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THE FACTORY AND IT WENT TO THE EM NACHALART WHAT A ON INTREFAGUS N IT NATALARCAWIN INTO FAGU SQUARE AND AND AN I WAS SITTING YOU KNOW WHILE HE WAS

TO SEE WIT A BAL AND SO I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE INLAND AS IT WERE AND BUT AT ONCE ID GOT USED TO IT O ERM AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN ADVENTURE AS WELL IN GOING OVER DID YOU SAIL A RANCE WE WENT OT YOU KNOW THOSE AND BOATS THEY TOOK THE TROOPS OVER IN IWE WENT OVER CAUSE ACTUALLY AND WHEN IT CAME TO IT THE WAR WAS THAT THE ARMY WAS ALMOST IN BERLIN BY THEN SO THEY FELT IT WAS SAFE TO PUT THE GIRLS OVER AND AND WE WENT ACROSS TO A LITTLE TOWN IN NORMANDY CALLED GRONFIELD ON THE WERE DUCKS WE CALLED THEM YO DU CIQET THOSE THE LIKE LANDING CRAFT AND AND I WAS TERRIBLY SER COMANIS AIT PROVES TO ME I WASN'T TO SAY DESCIKE THIS ALL OF THE DAY THAT YOU WENT ON THE THE LANDING FRANC TO FRANCE AS JUST GOING BACK A THE HONEST ORIN WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF KNOW THAT DAY WHERE DID YOU SAIL FOR OM AND WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LINE HE SAID TO YOU REMEMBER YET THE WEATHER WASN'T TOO GOOD HENCE THE FACT THAT I WASLA AN I SUPPOSE I THINK THEY WERE PROBABLY NEARLY BETWEEN FIFTY AND HUNDREDS OF US GOING NOT ONLY RIENDS BUT OTHERS AN TIM TO THINK WE WENT FROM THEM ONE AT ONE OF THE M LITTLE PORTS THEY WON'T REALLY PORTIT WERE AROUND THE BULY RIVER THAT THAT WAY AM WE WERE EXCITED WE DIDN'T YOU KNOW YOU YOU YOU HAD ALL SORTS OF IMAGINATIONS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN CROSSING THE CHANNEL MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW WULD YOU'D BE ABLE TO SWIM FAR ENOUGH AND THAT AM THE YOU KNOW THEY WE DIDNOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH WATER WHEN WE GOT THE OTHER SIDE LIKE WHO SEE THE MEN WOU LOV TRAILING OUT WITH ALL THEY LAFT THROUGH WATER THEY MANAGED TO BEACH US SO WE WERE QUITE DRY WHEN WE GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU KNOW THE FRENCH ACTUALLY ENORMITY WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING THEY WERE VERY PLEASED TO SEE US THEY WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN MY VIEW TO THE ONCE WE MET IN PARIS WAS THE OBVIOUSLY WATER OH YES YET YOU KNOW THE AM CAUSE IT WOULD BE AFTER DEDAY OF COURSE THAT WE WENT ACROSS THOUGH SEEMS WERE STILL PRETTY AND BROKEN YOU KNOW ALL THE AM A SORT OF FRONT LINE HOUSES AND THINGS WERE ALL BASHED ABOUT CAUE THEY'D BEEN BOD BARDED OF COURSE FROM THE SEA I GRO EWAS TE SET OUT THERE AN D YOUYOU YOU SAE WAL WASER DASF YEURLY IT WAS A WALL'S OWN WELL IT WAS IT WAS JUST A SORT OF GETTING OFF POISONT FOR MOVING PEOPLE ON BEHIND THE ARMY I THINK IT WAS FELT TO BE A REASONABLE PLACE TO START MOVING CAUSE WE HAD THE LOT OF EQUIPMECIS WELL WE DIDN'T BUT THE ARMY AND AND TERFORCE ONTE DAGY FOR THAT MATTER THAT ALL HAD EQUIPMENT TO MOVE UP WITH US AAN I THINK RATHR WULD PROBABLY AT A A LITTLE TOWN WAS CONSIDERED YOU KNOW THEY HAD A GOOD ROAD NOT GOOD BUT THE TRANSPORT SITUATION MOVING STUFF WAS REASONABLE BUT VERY BASSIC LIVING CONDITIONS YOU KNOW WE HAD NO WART RUNNING WASIR OR A WE HAD SORT OF THINGS LIKE YOUR TRIPEON WITH THE CANVAS BAGS IN ON WHICH WE USED THISS WASHING A MACHIO WO A FOR WASHING WHAT UNEU SIR OH BUT IT WAS LIKE A CAMP IGNRALE FROM A LIVING POINT OF VIEW AND VERY LITTLE WORK WE HAD AT THAT TIME WHAT W YOU JUST WRITING T YE A TELLY PRINCS RI IS O ANESE ACKNOLEDGYS OH YES SIS THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF BUT BUT NOT IN THE GROUP I WAS WITH YOU KNOW THAT THAT ACTUALLY THE FIRST PEOPLE TO GO OVER WERE THE COMMUNICATORS AND THE TELEPHONE OPERATORS AND SO ON AND AND OF COURSE THEY WERE STILL THE ENGINEERS WERE STILL FITTING UP FIELDS AND ECQUIPMENT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND THEY WERE A LOT OF EWRENS IN THAT GROUP TREMENDOUS SLUMBER AND AND FROM GRANFIELD AND YOU KNOW THEY FOUND THAT THE WORK THEY WANTED ME TO DO WAS MORE CENTRED BACK IN LONDON SO I WAS SHIPP BACK TO THEM LONDON AR TO WAIT UNTIL THEY APREPARED WHAT WE NEEDED AND ORI HAD TO HELP DO THAT AND AND WE WENT THEN ATO PARIS BUT I WENT FROM LONDON FROM ENGLANDS LAIN WENTWORTH TO AND PARIS ON MY OWN AND THEN I REALLY WAS HAD NOT BEEN ANYWHERE ON MY OWN BEFORE AND THE THEY I ONCE MET WHEN I GOT TO AND THE GARDIANOR AS I WENT OVER ON THE TRAIN AND BY ANOTHER WREN WHO HAD BEEN OVER AND THEN WE WERE I WAS BILATED IN WORKED IN THE CHATEAU IN AND BUT IT A SUBURB OF PARIS ANYHOW CRAWLE AND AND I WORKE THERE FOR A VERY SHORT TIME AND THEN THE AN ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP WERE FOLLOWING ON BEHIND THE ARMY AND WE WENT FROM AND PARIS TO FRANKFORIT AND AND I DIDN'T ENJOY FRANKFORT VERY MUCH BECAUSE AND THERE WASN'T MUCH TO DO BY NOW YOU KNOW MOST OF THE PLANNING HAD BEEN DONE AND LIFE BECAME RATHER O SORT OF THATHERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY POINTION WHAT WE WERE DOING WEV DONE THIS ALL YOU KNOW AND SO IT WAS A BIT OF A PLAYGROUND AS I TA ETER ITIS AFTER THE WALL YE LABBISHAET E AM TROOPS THAT HAD ENTERED BOURLIN AND AND WE WERE BACK IN OF PARIS SO T THE SORT OF JUST AS THE WAR WAS ENDING AND YET IT HAD ENDED BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME IN IN PARIS AND WAT WAR WORTHY AN FASHION WAS YOU KNOW THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HATS MADE OUT OF CELESANE PAPER YOU KNOW SWEET PAPERS AND THINGS THAT THE WOMEN HAD MADE THEY SEEMED UNTOUCHED BY THE WAR IN PARIS THEY DIDN'T MUCH LIKE HIT I DON'TSE I THINK THE GERMANS HAVE GIVEN EM QUITE A GOOD TIME YOU WL EPLOY THOSE BOY NO I MET ADMIRALL PARRY WHEN I
