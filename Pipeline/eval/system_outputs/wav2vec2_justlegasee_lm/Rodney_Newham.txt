IS RODNEY NEWNHAM AND I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN I HAD AN APPRENTICESHIP IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD FOR FIVE YEARS AND THEN I SERVED A TIME MOST OF THE SHIPS THAT CAME IN ON REPAIRING I WAS IN THE BOILER MAKING TRADE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THE BOILER ROOMS AND ENGINE ROOMS WERE THE ONES THAT I WAS EMPLOYED IN AND I KNEW MORE ABOUT SHIPS AND SOME OF THE SAILORS KNEW BECAUSE I USED TO KNOW EVERY PART OF THE SHIP EVEN DOWN INTO THE SHAFT ROOM AND THE CHART IT WOULD GO THROUGH DRIVES THE PROPELLER AND ONE OF MY JOBS WAS TO PUT SAFETY SHIELDS OVER THE JOINTS OF THE SHAFT GOING THROUGH THE SHIP I KNEW ABOUT MOST OF THE SHIPS WERE THE ENGINE AND BOILER ROOMS MORE THAN ANYTHING AND THE AIR SUPPLIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN WE SAT IN ITS AIMS FOR ARTIFICER APPRENTICES OR DOCKYARD APPRENTICES AT THAT TIME I WANTED TO GO INTO THE NAVY BUT AT THAT TIME THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT YOU AS A ENGINE ROOM ARTIFICER IF YOU HAD GLASSES BECAUSE THE SHIPS IN THOSE DAYS A LOT OF STEAM CAME FROM THE BOILERS SO YOU COULDN'T DO IT SO I WENT THEN AS AN APPRENTICE IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD SERVED FIVE YEARS THAT WAS NINETEEN THIRTY SIX WHEN EVEN WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF THE DOCKYARD GATES CHILDREN WERE BEGGING THERE IN BARE FEET FOR YOUR SANDWICH IS YOUR HEAD OVER AND YOU USED TO GIVE THEM TO THE CHILDREN WHO WERE THERE WAITING FOR THE DOCKYARD PEOPLE TO COME OUT SO THAT THEY COULD GET EAST SIDE OF SANDWICHES IT DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE DOES IT BUT THAT'S TRUE YES I HAD A SISTER WHO WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD AND I HAD A BROTHER WHO WAS SEVEN YEARS YOUNGER WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM I NEVER KNEW I NEVER KNEW BUT MY SISTER SHE LIVED TO ABOUT EIGHTY THREE I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT MY SISTER MY FATHER WAS A CHIEF ENGINE ROOM ARTIST IN THE NAVID HIS TWENTY TWO YEARS YOU KNOW MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS EIGHT SO I NEVER REALLY KNEW HER MOTHER'S LOVE AND CARE FROM THE AGE OF EIGHT SO I CAN'T SAY I HAD A HAPPY CHILDHOOD SUCH HAVING A MOTHER'S CARE WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF YOUR EARLY APPRENTICESHIP IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD WHERE YOU ACTUALLY WAS THERE A SENSE OF WAR WERE YOU WAS IT WERE YOU BUILDING UP FOR WAR OR WAS IT JUST YOU KNOW A JOB FOR YOU AT THE TIME WELL IT WAS NINETEEN THIRTY SIX I WENT INTO THE DOCKYARD I WAS AN APPRENTICE FOR FIVE YEARS APPRENTICESHIP SIX SO IN THAT TIME THE WAR BROKE OUT THIRTY NINE THAT'S RIGHT SO I WAS SERVING THE APPRENTICESHIP ACTUALLY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT YES WELL IT WAS WHEN I FINISHED THE QUALIFIED BOILER MAKER WHICH WAS HARD JOB HARD WORK SO I DETERMINED AT THAT TIME I WOULDN'T STAY AS A BOILER MAKER SO I MADE PROGRESS IN THE TRIED EVENTUALLY BECAME AN INSPECTOR OF TRADES IN THE IN THE DOCKYARD THAT'S WHAT I RETIRED AS AN INSPECTOR OF TRADES THE APPRENTICESHIP OF THE BOILER MAKER WAS A HARD JOB IT WAS A HEAVY HEAVY MATERIAL JOB YOU CAN IMAGINE THE BOILERS THEY WEREN'T MODERN THEY WERE WHAT WE USED TO CALL YARROW BOILERS AND CYLINDRICAL BOILERS MADE OF METAL ABOUT AN INCH THICK AND WE USED TO ROLL IT SHAPE AND THEY WERE BIG UP TO THIRTY TON CAUSE THE CRANES USED TO HAVE TO LIFT THAT YES IT WAS HEAVY HARD WORK BOILER MAKING WAS YES I KNOW OF A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED WHEN HE HAD A PLATE DROPPED FROM A CRANE SLIPPED OUT OF A GRIP AND FELL ON HIM AND KILLED HIM YES TERRIBLE AND REMEMBER A MAN BEING KILLED ON THE CRANES USED TO GO UP AND DOWN ON RAILS LIFTING LIFTING A THIRTY ODD TON AND ONE MAN WAS CRUSHED UP ON A LINE AND IT WAS IT WAS A NAVAL OFFICER WHO ACTUALLY WENT UP THERE UP THE STEPS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WERE LOCKED SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULDN'T GET BUT HE WENT UP THERE TO RETRIEVE THE BODY OR TO SEE IF HE COULD DO ANYTHING FOR THE BODY VERY BRAVE MAN A NAVAL OFFICER LIEUTENANT HE WAS IT'S AS PLAIN AS IF IT WAS YESTERDAY YES YES HE WAS IT WAS HARD SOMETHING I'M QUITE INTERESTED IN RODNEY IS OBVIOUSLY CHATHAM A VERY VERY BUSY DOCKYARD DURING THE WAR YES DID YOU NOTICE YOU DID YOU NOTICE TO TALK A BIT ABOUT THIS ESCALATION AND THE AMOUNT OF WORK IN TERMS OF PROVIDING FOR THE WAR EFFORT THERE WAS A NUMBER VESSELS USED TO COME IN DAMAGE BECAUSE WAR AND THEY WOULD BE REPAIRED IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD AND WE USED TO DO MAKE GUN SHIELDS TORPEDO PLATFORMS REVOLVED FOR THE TORPEDOES ON AND WE USED TO DO MAKE THOSE PLATFORMS FOR TORPEDO TO BE FIRED FROM AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND GUN SHIELDS WE USED TO MAKE MADE OF BULLET PROOF METAL WHICH WAS VERY HARD TO WORK WITH YOU KNOW HARD ANY OF THEM BECAME THE ARTHOUSE WAS A CRUISER I WORKED ON AND THE LANDING WAS ANOTHER CRUISER AND A NUMBER OF FRIGATES MINESWEEPERS AND WE USED TO DO THE REFITS AND THAT WOULD MEAN STRIPPING OUT THE BOILER AND ENGINE ROOMS RENEWING A LOT OF THE STUFF AIR SUPPLY THROUGH THE VENTILATION TO THE ENGINE AND BOILER ROOMS THROUGH TURBO GENERA THAT COLLECTED THE AIR AND DISTRIBUTED IT AROUND THE SHIP THAT WAS ALUMINIUM TRUNK IN WITH GRILLS ON THE END OF THE TRUNK YOU COULD ALTER DIFFERENT POSITIONS IN THE ENGINE AND BOILER ROOMS I USED TO MAKE THOSE GRILLS AND FIT THEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT I REMEMBER THE GERMANS COMING OVER A NUMBER OF THEM I REMEMBER AND THE ARITHUSA CRUISER OPEN OPENED FIRE ON THEM AND A LOT OF THE CRAFT ITALIANS THAT CAME OVER BECAUSE IT WAS NOTICEABLE THAT THE GERMANS WOULD HAVE GONE ON BUT WHEN THE ARITHUSAR OPENED FIRE ON THEM A LOT OF THESE PLANES AND TURNED AROUND AND WENT BACK FROM WHERE THEY'D COME FROM YOU NEVER BELIEVED IT WOULD BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED YES THE GERMANS WOULD HAVE KEPT AND WOULD HAVE ATTACKED THEIR TARGET I THINK SOME OF THE OTHERS WERE ITALIANS YES BECAUSE WELL I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN IN A SHELTER I STOOD UP AGAINST ONE OF THE WORKSHOP WALLS AND THAT WAS MY SHELTER AND WATCHED THE ARITHUSA OPEN UP SHE WAS IN DOCK END UP AND I STOOD THERE WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL OF THE WORKSHOP AND SAW THESE MEN ON THE ARTHOUSE STRIPPED TO THE WAIST FIRING THE SHIPS GETTING THE SHELL EMPTY SHELLS AND THROWING THEM ASIDE AND UNLOADING AGAIN AND FIRING THAT WAS ON THE ARTHOUSE THEY REALLY GOOD THEY WERE THEY REALLY REALLY TURNED THE PLANE AROUND AN EXPERIENCE I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DOWN IN A SHELTER AND I DIDN'T GO DOWN THERE YES GIVEN ONE TO GO TO WHICH WAS JUST WELL I HAD A DUG OUT AND YOU WENT DOWN STEPS AND THAT WAS THERE BUT I WOULDN'T GO DOWN THE THING AND I STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL THE WORKSHOP YE NOT THAT I WAS BRAVE AT ALL IT'S JUST THAT I WOULDN'T GO DOWN IN A SHELTER TAKE THE CHANCE IN THE WAR WHEN YOU WEREN'T IN THE DOCKYARD OR WERE YOU LIVING IN THE DOCKYARD AS WELL NO I LIVED OUTSIDE OF THE DOCKYARD YES I LIVED IN GILLINGHAM ROAD FOR A TIME NEAR A RAILWAY CROSSING THAT PART OF GILLINGHAM I LIVED WITH MY FATHER THERE BECAUSE MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS EIGHT BUT I WAS WITH MY DAD I THINK WE THAT WE WOULD PUT IT LIKE THIS WINNING THE END YOU KNOW WE WOULD BE THE VICTORS AS A NATION BECAUSE THE EFFORT EVERYBODY WAS BEHIND THE WAR EFFORT AS FAR AS I KNOW THAT I SUPPOSE AS YOU WEREN'T PAID A LOT OF MONEY YOU WERE SOME PEOPLE MADE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE OF THE WAR BUT WE WERE NEVER LIKE THAT WE NEVER MADE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE OF THE WAR BEING ON IT WAS HARD WORK BUT A GREAT BIG SLAB USED TO DO THINGS ON WITH A VICE HEAVY VICE ONE END OF IT I USED TO ROLL PLATES AND CYLINDERS OUT OF AN INCH THICK MATERIAL AND TO WORK IN THE FURNACE AND PULL PULL RINGS OUT OF THE FURNACE AND ROUND THEM UP YOU USED TO HAVE TO HAVE AN ASBESTOS SHEET TO SHIELD US OUT FROM THE HEAT THAT CAME OFF WHEN YOU PULLED IT OUT WE RE ONTO A SLAB FROM THE FURNACE AND THE HEAT WAS SO GREAT YOU USED TO HOLD THIS SETS UP IN FRONT OF YOU TO PROTECT US FROM THE HEAT AS YOU ENDEAVOURED WITH LARGE LARGE HAMMERS TO SHAPE TO MAKE THEM INTO THE RIGHT SHAPE SOMETIMES THEY WEREN'T QUITE ROUND SO YOU HAD TO PUT DOGS ON THEM AND SHAPE THEM YOU JUST HAD PRESSES SHEETS TO PROTECT YOU FROM THE HEAT AND THE THING WAS THAT AS YOU THINGS OUT OF SPEC SHEETS AND YOU JUST SAW IT UP AND ALL THE DUST YOU BREATHE IT ALL IN NO WONDER SO MANY MEN DIED OF ASBESTOS I HAD WHAT THEY CALLED PLUG IN BOTH LUNGS WHICH I'VE GOT NOW BUT IT NEVER IT NEVER
