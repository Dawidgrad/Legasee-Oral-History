my name is irene bellamy from bristol from the fishponds area where i was born and i went to school in bristol i'm started my work after school in bristol well i was born in nineteen nineteen x twenty what was life like to you in school and i originally to have small private school and then went to colston from there and then it the bristol itself iphone seven plus all pubs and churches that's how it seemed to me that there are for young people today we spent most of our time either going to the capri time going to the cinema or playing sometimes of games you know eyeball various hockey team some tennis clubs and during during the war because we were long hours at yate so that you weren't looking for you much leisure fun and i moved because of the bristol blitz during that time i was put it by the firm they didn't want us in the danger of central bristol and so on and so they took over a cottage in chipping sodbury chipping sodbury for a couple of years and that was quite good fun and she was so the village life lots going on but i'd always had to go into the navy when the war broke out because i have friends who have joined the services yeah i didn't want to join doing no no and she had a very interest fine as out in washington working for the network naval the airport open to what you were doing the work and stuff as secretary to the chief does the beginning it was a question of doing typing he would dictators design reports that will have to go up to the elements troufa approval because they were looking for a an order for these plains of course and it was typing all these sheets description of these planes and that i mean to say he was a very undisciplined man in that he left everything to the last minute so i'm just work goodnight very often to get it down to the deadline that the ministry and set basil henderson and he designed a small playing called me they call it the henley breakdown of his name but it was basil him it'll come to me in that it was at the time that there was another chap designing those small planes i can't think of his name but that would have been in about nineteen years thirty seven thirty eight not really i mean to say at the boy is it with used to meet and mix feel when mostly airforce types interested in the airport and we knew little five hundred and one squadron at filton most of them flu with and we you at times from their conversation that things were getting ready near but not really you know not and then you know we weren't putting up the barricades or anything i do that sunday when they announced is watching these lads in their planes taking off purely for exercise in bristol what was the change do you remember i can't honestly safe as most of my life was spent between fishponds and yates you know i very rarely when the way towards town and didn't really get any feeling of what things were like even you know i read that about some of the gastro things that happened in the the loss of life but it didn't affect me directly my parents have a shopping list buttons and they still get going in quiet sort of way and that was long as the reasons why the firm moved us to live in yate so that we didn't have the business of travelling but we do have a daylight raising in yates and that was very traumatic they were late they sent a single plane and it's a miracle working away quite happy there a siren went and i just been taught how to play bridge vodafone who went into the air force and we didn't take any notice of the retiring give me never had anything and saturday night explosion and the whole building shock and what has happened a single playing this canon apparently it came in from somewhere in the northern france area where the germans have airports and then up the bristol channel to somewhere north of gloucester railway line runs along the railway line if you know the building and flew down and drop the strip of bombs factory fortunately a couple of them didn't go off and i think it's about fifty seven people were killed and it was my first experience of seeing a dead body because i knew most of the people in the factory because of who i was working for and one of the other people living in the house in the in chipping sodbury was woman sister hobbs who became quite well known for the work she did in my bits and she just got home and she's had come on we've got to go up to the brick factory she said to these people who been killed and i was taken it was nineteen forty one so twenty two at twenty two to see all the disintegrated bothered and i haven't seen again for me before and that was very traumatic i want to join become a red now no i don't think so that was quietly simmering away and i think the catalyst in the end was my boss moved he went to a firm which game you may know of boosey and hawkes they he wasn't a musician but you haven't made me with the job they do originally they were making spare parts for some of our guns are and they found that he was a man who could design what they wanted and they got him they headhunters him and when he left i wasn't too happy with the person who got the job alive so i won't move but i had to work quite hard to get into the rent because of course i was in a reserved occupation reserved occupations to go to the procedure to get out and they went the men's went open for recruitment any help and at that time you were being drawn last of the word for the by war artist a man called leopold free so i haven't been able to run to us since i've tried because he didn't like a mural of people working and then factory and it went to the national what's the weather in trafalgar sinnott national art gallery in trafalgar square and i was city and it will he was drawing me and talking to him i said i wanted to join the random the problem with no vacancies reserved occupation so he gave me the name of a woman again i forgotten her name but the head of the ministry of labour in london so i go off to london to see this woman and she told me she told me that you saw them inside secret that ought to be able to get in fairly soon because the rams are expanding and they expanded very rapidly that isn't very easy but i had to wait till the doors open does the lords of the admiralty didn't want women they reluctantly took them at the beginning of the war but it was a man the service it wasn't so what was the process then from transitioning from being a secretary in the becoming a rent then yeah i remember having my pay person being sent to leeds because because they suddenly expanded they had to open new training depots in early twenty and i had what they call a white paper which was the recommendation for a commission as soon as you were interviewed original most girls have to wait and work a while but i was older and play some amazing possible admin office silver do they actually but then i went from leeds after i did my basic training to rochester or chatham now i have seen myself is both screw you know in and because i was a pistolier that wanted to go to plymouth which was that the navy had other ideas though they sent me to be waiting to go to training for an admin officer at chatham really anyhow they put me in what's called the red casing office pictures you know where you monitor people coming in and going out and telephones and i always remember the first officer who was the was a very very drunk woman she was the daughter of the somebody called lady birtenshaw who lived in hove and every saturday afternoon lady birtenshaw with ring up her daughter desperate chat and i was put on the telephone life and never worked at your nose plug in telephone bangladesh lady birkenshaw comes through and very confident about it what do i do in very middle of their concert i pull the plug out to see so i had to go in she called me the telephone for me man so should you read but that that remark really has stuck with me all my life i suppose i was northmount it was well not only until the visit they said we were billeted in rochester and because i was doing the admin work in the office at the office attached to the billet to bristol this point i have not very far no that was another thing you didn't travel fire holidays for the furthest we went with ten but i had been to london and i had been to france on the school trip once but no not know far we went very well only has a family you know we had to cut corners where did you where did you go then when i was at rochester and the first officers was telling you called me broken me i was in the what do they call it now the office which allocated postings to the all the girls they were waiting to be sent somewhere and i was there and nothing came in because i was looking through the different things that came in from the admiralty and nothing came in i was interested in that i was down for adam and then i found that to do admin my had to go to lowestoft to the captain's office where they trained admin offices and i found that there was a long waiting list and i still i didn't join the navy office wait for that so i i was given the opportunity to go and i said no so there's nowhere you realise you'll go to the bottom of the list so she said to me if you see anything coming through teleprinter and those says let me know and i'll see if i don't want to work in london i don't mind where else i go and you know i'd like to stick with my shorthand another sort of general office in comes it was it the time when general eisenhower was getting to be quite well known as a commander and setup if you remember safe am i looked it like something came in with a mcx a shave and i thought that's interesting and the angels txf was the allied naval come the expeditionary force and that was admiral ramsay and i thought that sounds interesting thanks for that vacancy and so she agreed you know you have to take your chance what are the applications they have and then i got it i said where is it so she settle to start with you'll have to go to norfolk square in london which is the headquarters of shave and the mcx group work and they were mostly friends who are going to do the dj planning but i got the two because i put him for and sex strokes i got attached to the this is wearable carrickayne with to add more clarity who typically british we hadn't started but they've who is the already post operative planning and that's what i was helping website that i was attached to him and send to bushy park in hertfordshire hertfordshire it's near hampton court palace and it was generalising has headquarters the they were collecting all the more administrative people there are you know well the troops from being collected around pevensey sussex and play the sorry it's me nerves so why don't want to go to london but anyhow in the help and remember sitting on the wall outside norfolk house which is where the london groupware and toast wait till somebody would pick me up from then on that became very secretive hanger city letter lonely reading with my neighbour chasing nothing lg moving round the square an american stop by me and dad are you on a bushy park will i shall i don't know where i'm going i've just been told to sit on this walk so he said he got me and we went through that far from norfolk to get out of bushy park when i get to bushy park i'm only round there because it was a separate unit two the big group norfolk house b forty four forty four thousand, four hundred and fifty well bushy park it is i presume it's the sort of local is a very large park and internet were porta cabins in which you got the british french and americans the liverpool slums few but not thinking of the group that they split germany hop into region was the british russian i can't remember russian was being at bushy park haven't they linked up later but i remember being in one of we have our office and this is where i just met him but the doodlebugs had started flying and we will they got they have washing parking near science and they got very nearest but so they were air raid shelters built specially what are the americans particularly for women in the american army had never experienced anything like it before i just went to pieces if there was an error service lot but i i quite enjoyed being wasn't it was a different lifestyle altogether the equipment they gave hygiene put in so i was i was under supervision somebody called lady brecknock i think she became quite a power as well and afterwards from a political point of view but she was in the machine and i resented her because she my post the navy never opened your post because i'm an eighty rule what are posters ocean and lady brecknock always made a point of reading and remembering what was in an android send me home for money she was always saying you know you don't need money you've got plenty you can manage on what you've got that was seven and six weeks no front from there yes no i was talking about the doodlebugs if he was on site in his office he didn't come very often because of his responsibilities as an enormous and the places you know people eisenhower's there but they been left there for long but he did use the air raid shelter which was the same shelter that we use because we're in the joining officers but you know he hardly saw us because she's pop down and all his entourage be with him wouldn't feel we will leicester with him he had a word to say that you can't really say you met him not actually until i went across to to france because in the meantime his one of his side kicks to know who have been the portuguese the day at the day will represent lisbon and so when he he joined us on on the staff of your parrot i was attached to him he was called me his melina do you know i've never actually spoken to a portuguese to find out i was told it meant friend but i was always here always told people if they wanted something go last night but he's very gentle very nice man about whom i knew never heard much about him of all i know i've broke at the end of the war i think he was an app that's what it is his retirement that's what he did but captain i never knew privy to it were absolutely although i wasn't in the typing pool as it was i knew i seen papers going through and you know what the planning wells what age was bing crosby the third level which must be absolutely i don't think we could ever get through with never special line wasn't things on the telephone and it was mostly for you by telephone but i never really knew how they decided you when i had to if i had to make call which line i had to use either was the the top secret or bigger but i never knew when say captain though it was wanting me to do something and he said that will be bigger how he had to be bigger is no that was something loans for him doing the captain whichever one wasn't doing the the postal under taking dictation over the what planning they had to do in terms of post office the post office his stuff was the division of the german navy when the war was over who's gonna help that was interesting because cost of rationed everything this further on the live at the russians voice ones and all the big stuff you and we knew all the best equipment was in the smallest we went for those so they will work it out of all those sort of things because you don't have to go up through the admiralty back again so thought up the time but it was just a short report you to the post office of planning did you any other not churchill any of the other big winston churchill montgomery we when we were in germany it was of hashem they have a dog and i never had one but my friend have one which frat does africa and i remember we we had an office we were in frankfurt the time and the office there helen sort of staircase going up and paddy was cracked work because the war was over back by then and we were going upstairs one day somebody said watch out montgomery's coming and he was in the building some meeting and he was coming again with his entourage downstairs as we were going up to see and apparently he didn't do it in front of us but when he got back this office he told his adjutant to contact where was responsible for the romans to say that he doesn't want dogs and rebuilding typical all this stuff is going to be june fifth you did you know that will yes because your name of the delay yeah the delay yes well it was you do you didn't know they were always things being said put you off so that you went hundred percent sure i don't suppose anybody was really because of the weather in things that we were when i was at chatham and there wasn't no we done all the work we had to do a we will waiting we were cherry picking in the kent orchards and that was amazing because the ball the lanes roads all around the area going down to the coast was full of army vehicles and men waiting and they're ready to go but i think that's how i learnt rather than through the office i didn't know that i am from bushy park we were moved back to london and i worked in princes gardens there and we lived in in england's lane england's lane swiss cottage way and there was a nurses home now i think it was a charing cross nurses home and they use that for a visit travel to travel to princes gardens from there alec was from princes gardens that i was drafted over to france because i felt like i am still that my navel life was anything but navy you know though because i have great ideas of being boats cruise i said i'm going to see you so i was a bit disappointed that it was going to be in land as it were but once i've got used to it and there was a certain adventure as well then going over don't say took the troops over in leyton weekend over because actually when it came to it the war was that the army was almost live in berlin by so they felt it was safe to put the girls over and we went across to a little town in normandy called granville on the sweet called cuk those like landing craft and i was terribly sick how many say prove to me i've listened to save describe the sort of the day that you went on the the landing cross to france so just going back in a bit and what you remember of you know that they can you sail from and what was the weather like in can you remember if the weather wasn't too good hence the fact that i was i suppose i think there are between fifty and one hundred of us not only rounds trying to think we went from eleven of the little ports they went really portsmouth for around the beaulieu river that that way we're excited we didn't you know you you had all sorts of imaginations of what might happen crossing the channel might think you only swim for an offer you know then we don't have to go through water only got the other side like who sees them and the other trailer is all the stuff through water they managed to beat us so we were quite dry when we got to the other side actually in normandy were very accommodating very pleased to see if they were very different to the ones we met in paris oh yes yeah the other of the because it would be after d day of course it we weren't across those things were still pretty broken you enable all the frontline houses and things were all dashed about because they've been bombarded of course from the sea well it was it was just getting off point for moving people on behind the army i think it was felt to be a reasonable place to start moving because we have a lot of equipment as well we didn't but the army and had a quick look to move up with her and i think grandma probably has a little timeless considered you know they had good not good transport situation moving stuff but very basic living conditions you know we have no water running water over it will be had sort of things like your tripod with the canvas bags in one we use this washing machine jumping really from a living for interview and very little work we have says that time is there any technology first the telephone operators all the engineers for still fitting upfield equipment when they arrived and they were lots of that group tremendous number and they found that lee work they wanted me to do with more sensors back in london so i was shipped london wait until ladies prepares what we need is i had to help you let and we went then to paris but i went from london from england's lane where was two parrots on my own and then i really was a lot been anywhere i own before and the day i once met when i got to the garden or went over on the train buy another rent been over and then we were i was billeted in works in the chateau in the what is the suburb of paris and i work there for a very short time and then the administrative group with following on behind the arm is from paris to frankfurt and i didn't enjoy frankfurt very much because there wasn't much to do by now you know most of the planning had been done and life became rather sort of legend see the point weaver do we done this all in there so it was a bit of a playground yeah troops under has entered berlin and we were back in paris so they sort of justice of war was ending things that struck me in in paris where the passion was you know the most beautiful hats made out of cellophane paper you know sweet papers of things that the women in made they seemed on tops by the war in paris this is much like the germans have given him quite a good time know when i got to paris add a person very quiet you didn't really feel that you know he could hit everybody everybody everybody he was always very gentle and very nice to work for very clever of course he is you are and what just describe the work in relationship what you did for him and what the purpose of you being there was he really would have communicated to captain owen most of what you want it cos he be offering something else but says it captain owen was really the person who was giving me work when they will work to be done but have admiral paris play was very approachable and he mixed with last there was no sort of officers and other everybody mixed describe really you know but the when we were in the living in the lakes the pharmacy that is the latest that on the outskirts but when we were living in what have been the japanese embassy in berlin the most beautiful harvest and it was in that district where the lakes where i was sent the lakes and they would freeze over in winter because we had a winter there and you know the skating classes you know because it's so cold that you can have barbecues on the ice and that's where life became a bit superficial when there wasn't much work to do you know you really help you should be somewhere somewhere owen label jeeps most of the travelling within the only only sing when i went from frankfurt to i have been home on leave and when i got back it was to find that i don't know why but they couldn't notify me they couldn't get hold of me to let me know that the main party has gone on to berlin and it when i got back to frankfurt i have to go and talk to one of the army officers to get transport and when i got there i x message to say that generalising the harries chauffeur had married and they were very friendly fire with and that he let them have his house in near frank for their honeymoon and they were both you back in berlin and they would give me a lift so i won't be that the autobahn from frankfurt to berlin generalisation house that really didn't know it you know that almost every building restore was destroyed destroyed and there were these and they weren't necessarily old woman but they haven't stopped you know in dark clothes with wheelbarrows clearing the streets working so hard and little food you know they were working very little strange but i must give the joneses said to you they did work hard to get him back the brandenburg gate well it was more like a tourist trip you know i've been trying to think what office in berlin was lighting tube of course it was a control commission and i i can't visualise a toilets and absolute blank in my memory i can remember the reverie is a japanese embassy and i can remember going on the tram from there to the office but i can't remember the office at all and i thought i was there for nearly yeah that so yeah we went to see if the bunker you know where hitler was killed and was still in pretty rough state you know bits of furniture was still there i haven't been tidied out the german set the time well if it was interesting because iphone the very helpful with them and you know i quite like them but they had a lot to gain from us some away for the russians cost for the the problem because the story goes that the main russian army in berlin they pull them back and they replace them with the son of sir dry hu mongolian and they were pretty rough and one occasion coming home from the office a couple very drinkable awful off any booze like a couple of very drunk russians start walking home from here office in berlin and they started getting their gardens shooting all over the place and we had to jump in the head and after that to keep out of their way and after that they put a strong marine presents on the radio and we weren't allowed to travel on our own so have you transport forgot the travel hope this is you started walking we had a german cook and he found difficult to be pleasant to have but he was because of course he used to collect her used tea bags and take them home and he knew this he did you notice or properly he get taken off and we'll get someone else and he's lose out on his bits and pieces he was getting and we also had an interesting made francisca who was german dr tolley jewish and she has had a very bad time she had legitimately because when i told him it was her boyfriend and not a german russian pregnant and she had this baby and the seller which she was hiding from because the angels are still looking for jewellers even after the under anyhow it was a russian soldier who actually helped her have a baby at in the seller and rescued her and then of course the british we were in the british legion francesc used to have lessons season in german for us she was an educated yes the potsdam conference was i was in the lil and carry of course heather because the main purpose was to sort of finalise the breakup of the german navy and i went with captain loan because of course they done their work on the navy's to contribute for that i didn't go into the actual hell it's quite small actually i was surprised i've been back soon still had another look at it as it is more but i went this time you loads because i was driving as well you very so our group captain sense you like to go you can but you won't be able to go into the conference that yellow you saw stalin churchill to you talk to me earlier about how the the navy new more about the german navy than the russians the russians wondered the carriers the brits wanted to destroy a recap on that was there any more of that discussion sort of pre potsdam that you can recall or was it also done and dusted by then no i don't i think they thought there was another had more miles was someone who appeared on the scene it's before potsdam and he had a lot to do you know sorting out the german navy but tyre forgot my your question was well done before i don't remember i know there was and i can't remember what the saturday was supposed to have been an incident when i don't mean churchill i mean attlee because it was at the potsdam conference you know the churchill theatre seat an athlete came in and that means made a change of foreign secretary and it was boxes then now the big band playlist he was at this foreign secretary and he is reported to have got crossover something at pottstown and down the table and water leather glasses water which i gather that the russians in take this man you know to have his way at the work up until we got to berlin was really quite interesting but once you nosey final for being put on the dividing of the city into regions and things like the breakup of the name of the german navy there wasn't much interest in salou and become a source of almost the playground tell me about vj day when we were in berlin when bjj was announced and they said they would be a parade what's the brandenburg guide so we went had the day off and went down to see and it was a wonderful display even though it was the end of the war and body was a bit tired of a feather the americans put on the great show with what equipment they had and side of the russians drill the end of the railway yes i suppose we wearing wet we're all a bit uncertain about what was going to happen you know the war was over you know there was this devastated city how is it going to be loving you know who was going to see you in germans behave themselves with little recognition that the russians were really the problem in terms of the future because that was in stalin's day of course yes it was it was like going out of any group just going out to see a praising day mobs i said i wanted to be they were them planning the breakup of all the services alder i went back to chatham just to be handover sings that quickly i got them i had to return it was a very uneventful things like home was that was a bit difficult for me to explain because it was mainly for the work with ideas you know the thing that came una from from the palace just said the zeal and devotion to duty whatever that means because it was a wartime and there was no sort of going to the palace to get your galway this evening and it just came in the post to feel that it was recognise it wasn't mad reinforced steel madly responsible you felt you work out which is what i wanted to do in the beginning single serve your king and country do you reflect on your life is a red then i think one of the things you know i began to become much more interested in being people rather than paper as it were and i don't have had her i was looking around for a job and i just found there was a an approved school wanting a secretary and they called them housemistress in bath and bristol i didn't want to go back to my own job and that's how that was my first step into social work and then my father became very ill and as the unmarried daughter in the family i was expected to be at home and you know i was concerned for both of them because my mum so i returned i gave up the approved school that i was working at which incidentally the last one was a place called davencroft in middlesex which has been associated with jimmy savile i left on croft i had got myself a job with bristol children's department which was in the days before the social as such were forms and i save them till i retire which college do you know that's twenty nine years ago oh yes it was the renaissance remains constant because they have a strong association and that's how you rang me to earth and i belong to a local branch since nineteen fifty three as i join
