OLD WERE YOU WHEN WARBROKE AM WELL I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN NINETEEN TIMES TWENTY WHAT WAT WAS IFE LIFE FYOU IN BRISTOL AN YOU WEL TH HA TO AMY BIT OF MY SCHOOLING AN AND NDISLIE AN BRISSU SOI UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE E AM I ORIGINALLY WENT TO A SMALL PRIVATE SCHOOL AM AND THEN WENT TO COLSTON FROM THERE AND AM IT A BRISTOL ITSELF I FOUND RATHER DULL YOU KNOW IT WAS ALL PUBS AND CHURCHES THAT'S HOW IT SEEMED TO ME YOU KNOW THERE WEREN'T THELO THE FUN THINGS THAT THERE ARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO DAY AM WE SPENT MOST OF OUR TIME EITHER GOING TO THE AUR FREE TIME GOING TO THE SINUA AM OR PLAYING SOME KIND OF GAMES YOU KNOW I BELONGED TO UNO VARIOUS HOCKEY TEAMS AND TENNIS CLUBS AM AND AM DURING DURING THE WAR AM ECAUSE WE WORKED VERY LONG HOURS AM AT EIGT SO THAT YOU WEREN'T LOOKING FOR YOU MUCH LEISURE FUN AND I MOVED BECAUSE OF THE BRISTOL BLITS DURING THAT TIME AND I WAS PUT BY THE FIRM THEY DIDN'T WANT US IN THE DANGER OF CENTRAL BRISTOL AND SO ON AND SO THEY TOOK OVER A COTTAGE IN SHIPTING SODBURY AND I LIVED IN SHIPSIN SODBURY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS A THAT WAS QUITE GOOD FUN AY THA SORT OF VILLAGE LIFE LOTS GOING ON BUT I'D ALWAYS HAD A YENDTO GO INTO THE NAVY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT MAINLY BECAUSE I HAD FRIENDS WHO HAD JOINED THE SERVICES AND WHOSE IXQUISIT RENS OVER ANY OTHER SERVICE YE I DIDN'T WANT TO JOINT YOU MEAN ER ENAUH FOR AIT S OR NO NO NO TH MY PARTICULAR FRIEND WENT INTO THE WAR AND SHE HAD A VERY INTERESTING TIME AS OUT IN WASHINGTON A WORKING FOR RO METNOT MABEL THE AIRFORCE THE REN WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE YES YES LIKE THE UNIFORM TOO YE JUS TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YATE AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE AND UNDESTIS THE WORKIN STUFF AM WELL M AS SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF DESIGNER IN THE BEGINNING AMD IT WAS A QUESTION OF DOING AM TYPING HE WOULD DICTATE HIS DESIGN M REPORTS CAUSE IT HAD ALL HAD TO GO UP TO THE AIR MINISTRY FOR APPROVAL A BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A AN ORDER FOR THESE PLANES OF COURSE AND IT WAS TYPING ALL THESE SHEETS OF DESCRIPTION OF THESE PLANES AM AND THAT I MEAN TO SAY HE WAS A VERY UNDISCIPLINED MAN IN THAT HE LEFT EVERYTHING TILL THE LAST MINUTE SO ONE WAS WORKING QUITE LATE AT NIGHT VERY OFTEN TO GET IT DONE TO THE DEAD LINE THAT THE MINISTRY HAD SET YO NO BASIL HENDERSON AND HE DESIGNED A SMALL PLAYING CALLED THE AM WHAT DID THEY CALL IT AM THE HENDY IT WAS A BREAK DOWN OF HIS NAME BUT IT WAS BASIL HEN AM IT'LL COME TO ME BUT IT WAS A ROUND ABOUT THE TIME THAT THERE WAS A ANOTHER CHAP DESIGNING THOSE SMALL PLAINES AM I CAN'T THINK OF HIS NAME NOW BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THE WAR WAS COMING AM NOT REALLY NO I MEAN TO SAY THATTHE BOYS THAT WE USED TO MEET AND MIX WITH W WERE MOSTLY AM AIRFORCE TYPES OR GOING INTERESTED IN THE AIRFORCE AND WE KNEW THERE WE A LITTLE FIVE O ONE SQUADRON THE AT FILTON M THAT MOST OF THEM FLEW WITH M AND WE KNEW AT TIMES THAT FROM THEIR CONVERSATION THAT THINGS WERE GETTING VERY NEAR BUT A NOT REALLY YOU NOW NOT YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T PUTTING UT THE BARRICADES OR ANYTHING WHAT ABOUT THE OUTBREAK OF WAR DO YOU REMEMBER THA I DO IN WE WERE ATLY ON FILTON EIRODROME ENTHEN THAT SUNDAY WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED IT A WATCHING THESE LADS IN THEIR PLANS TAKING OFF PURELY FOR EXERCISE SAE DID THINGS CHANGE IN BRISTOL WHEN WAR BROKE OUT WHAT WAS THE CHANGE DOYOU REMEMBER I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY BECAUSE MOST OF MY LIFE WAS SPENT BETWEEN FISHPONDS AND YATES YOU KNOW I VERY RARELY WENT THE OTHER WAY TOWARDS TOWN AND DIDN'T REALLY GET ANY FEELING OF WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE AM EVEN YOU KNOW I READ NOW ABOUT SOME OF THE GHASTLY THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMMING YOU KNOW THE LOT OF LIFE M BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME DIRECTLY AM MY PARENTS HAD A SHOP IN FISHBONDS AND THEY STILL KEPT GOING YOUNOW IN A QUIET SORT OF WAY DID YOU SEE THE PLACE YO SE WERE YOU IN WERE YOU IN ATE WEN YES I WAS INEAT ERE AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FIRM MOVED US TO LIVE IN YATE SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BUSINESS OF TRAVELLING M BUT WE DID HAVE A DAYLIGHT RAID IN IN YATE AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC AM THEY WETHEY THEY SENT A SINGLE PLAINE I MEU SEE WE WERE ALL WORKING AWAY QUITE HAPPILY IN THE AIRRADE SI ROOM WENT AND I WAS BEING TAUGHT HOW TO PLAY BRIDGE BY THE FRIEND WHO WENT INTO THE AIRFORCE AND A WE DIDN'T TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE ARETIRINCAS WE NEVER HAD ANYTHING AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS THE MOST ALMIGHTY EXPLOSION AND THE WHOLE BUILDING SHOOK AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED A SINGLE PLANE HAD COME IN APPARENTLY IT CAME IN FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTHERN FRANCE AREA WHERE THE GERMANS HAD AM AIRPORT AND HAD FLOWN UP THE BRISTOL CHANNEL TO SOMEWHERE NORTH OF GLOSTER PICKED UP THE RAILWAY LINE AND YATE RUNS ALONG THE RAILWAY LINE IF YOU KNOW THE BUILDING AND FLEW DOWN AND DROPPED THIS STRIP OF BOMS ALONG THE FACTORY FORTUNATELY A COUPLE OF THEM DID GO OFF BUT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SEEING A DEAD BODY BECAUSE I KNEW MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FACTORY BECAUSE OF WHO I WAS WORKING FOR AND ONE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOUSE IN THE INN CHIPPING SOBRY WITH A WOMAN CALLED SISTER HOBBS WHO BECAME QUITE WELL KNOWN FOR THE WORK SHE DID IN THAT BLICE AND SHE JUST COUGHT HOLD OF ME AND SHE SAID COME ON WE'VE GOT TO GO UP TO THE BRICK FACTORY SHE SAID TO IDENTIFY THESE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN KILLED AND YOU KNOW I WAS TAKEN WHAT AUGHT I IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE TOUGHT I TWENTY TWO AT TWENTY TWO TO SEE ALL THESE DISINTEGRATED BODIES I HADN'T SEEN A DEAD BODY BEFORE AND THAT WAS VERY TROMATIC WAT THAT YOU THINK A CATALIST OF THINKING I WANTED YON BECOMA RE NO I DON'T THINK SO NO NO THAT WAS QUIETLY SIMMERING AWAY AND I THINK THE CATALIST IN THE END WAS WHEN MY BOSS MOVED HE WENT TO A FIRM WHICH GAIN YOU MAY KNOW OF BOOSY AND HAWKS THEY EM HE WASN'T A MUSICIAN OR HE HADN'T MADE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS COSE THAT WAS THE JOB THEY DID ORIGINALLY THEY WERE MAKING SPARE PARTS FOR SOME OF OUR GUNTURRETS AND THEY AM FOUND THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD DESIGN WHAT THEY WANTED AND M THEY GOT HIM THEY HAD HUNTED HIM AND WHEN HE LEFT I WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH A PERSON WHO GOT THE JOB AND I THOUGHT I WANT TO MOVE BUT I HAD TO WORK QUITE HARD TO GET INTO THE RENS BECAUSE OF COURSE I WAS IN RESERVED OCCUPATION AS YOU NO ASK WHAT EVER IS I ASSUMED IT WAS A RESERVED OCCUPATION SO YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCEDURE TO GET OUT YES AND THEY WEREN'T THE RENDS WEREN'T OPEN FOR RECRUITMENTS ANYHOW AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE BEING A E DRAWN I SUPPOSE IS THE WORD FOR THE BY WAR ARTIST A MAN CALLED LEOPOLD FREEDMAN HO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RUN TO EARTH SINCE I'VE TRIED BECAUSE HE DID IT LIKE A MURAL OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THE FACTORY AND IT WENT TO THE MNASHALARK WHAT ONE INTREFALGA THE NIGHT NASHALART GALLERYIN IN TREFALGAR SQUARE O AND M I WAS SITTING YOU KNOW WHILE HE WAS DRAWING ME AND TALKING TO HIM AND I SAID I WANTED TO JOIN THE RENEM THE PROBLEM WAS THERE WERE NO VACANCIES AND I WAS IN E RESERVED OCUPAT SO HE GAVE ME THE NAME OF A WOMAN AGAIN IE FORGOTTEN HER NAME BUT SHE WAS THE HEAD OF THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR IN LONDON SO I GO OFF TO LONDON TO SEE THIS WOMAN AND SHE OPED SHE TOLD ME THE SORT OF INSIDE SECRET THAT I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN FAIRLY SOON BECAUSE THE RENS WERE EXPANDING AND THEY EXPANDED VERY RAPIDLY AND I GOT IN VERY EASILY THEN BUT I HAD TO WAIT TILL THE DOORS OPEN CAUSE THE LORDS OF THE ADMIRALTY DIDN'T WANT WOMEN YOU KNOW THEY RELUCTANTLY TOOK THEM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR BUT YOU KNOW IT IT WAS A MAN'S SERVICE IT WASN'T FOR WOMEN RILLI SO WHAT WAS THE PROCESS THEN FROM TRANSITIONING FROM BEING A SECRETARY IN YATE TO BECOMING A RENT WUTO REMEMBER OF IT YE I REMEMBER YOU KNOW HAVING MY PAPERS OF BEING SENT TO LEADS BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY SUDDENLY EXPANDED THEY HAD TO OPEN NEW TRAINING DEPOES I WAS IN MY EARLY TWENTIES AND A I HAD WHAT THEY CALL A WHITE PAPER AM WHICH WAS A RECOMMENDATION FOR A COMMISSION AS SOON AS YOU WERE INTERVIEWED ORIGINAL YOU KNOW MOST GIRLS HAVE TO WAIT AND WORK A WHILE BUT I WAS OLDER AND I THINK THEY SAW ME AS A POSSIBLE ADMIN OFFICE WOR THEY DID ACTUALLY BUT THEN I WENT FROM LEADS AFTER I DID MY BASIC TRAINING TO ROCHESTER WHICH IS REALLY THE CHATTAM NOW I HAD SEEN MYSELF HIS BOATS CREW YOU KNOW MAND BECAUSE I WAS A BRISTOLIAN I WANTED TO GO TO PLYMOUTH WHICH WAS AM BUT THE NAVY HAD OTHER IDEAS SO THEY SENT ME A TO BWAIT TO GO TO TRADING FOR AN ADMIN OFFICER AT CHATTAM REALLY AM ANYHOW I THEY PUT ME IN WHAT'S CALLED THE REGULATING OFFICE WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHERE YOU MONITER PEOPLE COMING IN AND GOING OUT AND TELEPHONES AND EM I ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THE FIRST OFFICER WHO WAS THE ONE IN CHARGE WAS A VERY VERY ADURAB WOMAN AM AND SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY CALLED LADY BERTONSHAW WHO LIVED IN HOVE AND EVERY SATURDAY AFTERNOON LADY BERTONSHAW WOULD RING UP HER DAUGHTER JUST FOR A CHAT AND I WAS PUT ON THE TELEPHONE WELL I' NEVER NEVER WORKED AYOU KNOW THOSE PLUGGIES AND TELEPHONES I NEVER WOR ON OF THOSE AND OF COURSE LADY BERTON SHAW COMES THROUGH AND I WAS A PANIC YOU KNOW I WASN'T VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT IT AND OF COURSE WHAT DO I DO IN HE VERY MIDDLE OF THEIR CONVERSATION I PULLED THE PLUG OUT YOU SEE SO I HAD TO GO IN SHE CALLED ME IN AND SHE SAID WHO WAS ON THE TELEPHONE SO I SAID IT WAS ME MA'AM SO YE DEW ON NOTHING BUT A BROKEN REED AND I THOUGHT WILL NOBODY HAS EVER CALLED ME A BROKEN READ BEFORE A A A BUT YOU

DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE INLAND AS IT WERE AM BUT ONCE ID GOT USED TO IT AM AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN ADVENTURE AS WELL IN GOING OVER DID YOU SAIL TO FRANCE WE WENT OUT YOU KNOW THES AM OATS THEY TOOK THE TROOPS OVER IN ETHE WE WENT OVER BCAUSE ACTUALLY AM WHEN IT CAME TO IT THE WAR WAS THAT THE ARMY WAS ALMOST IN BERLIN BY THEN SO THEY FELT IT WAS SAFE TO PUT THE GIRLS OVER AM AND WE

SORT OF GETTING OFF POINT FOR MOVING PEOPLE ON BEHIND THE ARMY I THINK IT WAS FELT TO BE A REASONABLE PLACE TO START MOVING CAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF EQUIPMENT AS WELL WE DIDN'T BUT THE ARMY AND AND THE AIRFORCE AND THE NAVY FOR THAT MATTER THEY ALL HAD EQUIPMENT TO MOVE UP WITH US AM N I THINK GRAVILLE PROBABLY AD AT A LITTLE TOWN WAS CONSIDERED YOU KNOW THEY HAD A GOOD ROAD NOT GOOD BUT THE TRANSPORT SITUATION MOVING STUFF WAS REASONABLE BUT VERY BASIC LIVING CONDITIONS YOU KNOW WE HAD NO WATRUNNING WATER OR AM WE HAD SORT OF THINGS LIKE YOUR TRYPOD WITH CANVAS BAGS IN EM WHICH WE USED AS WASHING A MASHIWE E FOR WASHI WHATUGAS THERE O BUT IT WAS LIKE A CABNPIGNREALY FROM A LIVING POINT OF VIEW AND VERY LITTLE WORK WE HAD AT THAT TIME WHTWULDWERE YOU JUST WRITING DID YOU HAVE

FRANKFORT VERY MUCH BECAUSE EM THERE WASN'T MUCH TO DO BY NOW YOU KNOW MOST OF THE PLANNING HAD BEEN DONE AND LIFE BECAME RATHER A SORT OF THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY POINT IN WHAT WE WERE DOING WE DONE IT ALL YOU KNOW AND SO IT WAS A BIT OF A PLAYGROUND SIS AT THE END OF BITIS AFTER THE WAR YE LABY SAYD THETTHE M TROOPS HAT HAD ENTERED BERLIN AM AND WE WERE BACK IN A PARIS SO IT WAS THOUGHT OF JUST AS THE WAR WAS ENDING AND YET IT HAD ENDED BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME IN IN PARIS AM WAT WHAT WERE THE FASHION S YOU KNOW THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HATS MADE OUT OF CELEPANE PAPER YOU KNOW
