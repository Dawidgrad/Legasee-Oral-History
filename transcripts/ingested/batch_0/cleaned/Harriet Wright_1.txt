harriet edith frosser was when i joined the wrens that was my name harriet where where are you from and why did you decide you wanted to be a wren oh well i've had other people ask me that and i think myself because i was auburn haired um pale skinned and freckly faced i didn't think that um the ats would suit me the uniform you know and i though that the navy blue would and i think that's the only reason really because we didn't live by the sea we were lived inland you know farming stock and where are you from aberdeenshire so just tell me what what impact did the war have on you as a young girl living in aberdeenshire well um i was still at school of course i went to academy and i was still at the academy and i remember um they used to be a reconnaissance plane come over every night you could almost set your watch by it eight o'clock ish and you knew i i knew we all knew that the engine had a different noise to it you know so you could tell that it was a german plane and then one night it was much more noisy and my father went outside mother went outside and then i decided i would follow and i had my hand on the doorknob still this hand and all of a sudden we heard this whistle and it was a bomb that they'd dropped in a ploughed field only about quarter of a mile away so that made me think that was you know at that stage when your up there you don't think of um of well conflict like that do you especially in the country and yet this is what happened and the lovely fireworks display all the parts coming out of the greens and what not you know but i think what happened was an aircraft had come up from they couldn't come up from because you see and um he had dropped this bomb to get away quickly but they had two bombs in um aberdeen they bombed the um ice rink and one of the i can't remember what and then i went into aberdeen one day um for some shopping and believe it or not i still can't understand why i did i heard this plane and i'm looking up and it was just rooftop high and there were um using the machine guns ratatatat you know and i'm standing there i was waiting for the bus at the um country bus station in waiting to go home what an idiot instead of running into a doorway or something like that you know so i go this sort of thing very early on um we ourselves thought they were maybe after the um bridges see they bombed those they would have had an awful lot of trouble getting round along way to go you know for the trains and things to get say up to get stuff over to the orkneys and that sort of thing so i thought right i want to do my bit
