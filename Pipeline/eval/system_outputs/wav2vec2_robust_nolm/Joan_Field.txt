PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT SO I DID SORT OF ACCEPT IT MORE AND I REALIZED THAT NHOUGH THEY ARE A BIT INSULAR AND THAT THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO BE OFF TPUTTING BUT THEY WERE NCAUSE THEY IT IS AN INSULAR LAND UP IN THE HIGHLANDS I DON'T NOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THE HIGHLANDS VERY WELL AN THEYE ARE A THING UNTO THEMSELVES OCAY WELL SO JUST O DO ME A FAVOUR THAN JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT OFBOUT ABOUT HAT WHAT THE BASE WAS LIT WHAT WHILE YOUR SURROUNDINGS LI WAYS SLEPT HAN PISE IS IT LITT IT OPEN AND OPEN YET AND THEYE WUL T WULD TALK ABOUT THE WORK YES WHELLE I OPENED FIRST OF ALL AM I WAS STATIONED IN WHAT WAS CALLED THE STATION HOTEL AND THE SIGNAL STATION ON THE PIER WAS ONLY A SHORT WALK AWAY AND I MET UP WITH A GIRL WHO WAS GOING TO WORK WITH ME SHE'D BEEN THERE ABOUT A WEEK WE HADN'T YET STARTED REALLY GETTING THE CONVOYS IN SO WE WERE TOLD WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THAT MTHE CONVOYS WOULD COME IN AND THEYD BE IN THE BAY AND WE HAD TO MANTEY MAN THE SHIPMANE ALL THE TIME AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO ON ANY BOATS THAT'S ANOTHER THE STORY M WE AM HAD TO MOUNT MONITER EVERYTHING COMING IN AND OUT WE ALSO HAD TO LOOK AFTER FUNNILY ENOUGH THE AM ARE F HAD THEIR SUNDERLANDS AND CATALINAS UP THERE AND UM THEY HAD A CALL SIGN WHICH CHANGED EVERY HOUR AND HALF OF THEM COULD NEVER EVER READ IT SO WE USED TO HAVE TO READ THEIR CO SIGNAL FOR THEM TO SEND THEIR PATROL BOLTOUT BUT THAT WAS BUNBEKNOWN TO O BASE WHO NEVER HAD A CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON IT WAS A CRAZY SET UP REALLY AND AM SUBMARINES ON PATROL DUTY USED TO COME IN ALONGSIDE THE PEER WE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THEM THEIR SIGNALS AM THEY WERED IMIT OUT ON PATROL THAT WAS MOSTLY WHAT WE WERE DOING AT THE PEER SIGNAL STATION AM BUT THIS WASN'T ADEQUATE ENOUGH AND GANAVAN SIGNAL STATION WHICH WAS RIGHT ROUND THE CORNER FROM WHERE WE WERE WAS STILL MANNED BY THE MEN AND THEY ALSO HAD A NEW ASDIC CENTER OPENING UP JUST BELOW WISHL BE VREY DARK ANNOUNCED DICK AND THEY LET USTO DUN BY THE MEN AND THE MEN WERE GOING FROM GADNAVAN AND THEY WERE GOING OVER TO LISMORE THE RENS WEREN'T ALLOWED OUT THERE BECAUSE H WAS NIT WAS COMPLETELY ALONE OUT THERE NO NO ER WAS NO INHABITATION OCEPT A FEW FOR FEW SHEEP FARMERS SO THE RENS WEREN'T ALLOWED OUT IN ISMORE AND THAT'S WHERE THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN UNBEKNOWN TO ANYBODY AM SO THE GANAVAN SIGNAL STATION WAS GOING TO OPEN UP AND WE WERE GOING TO GO THERE WHICH MEANT VERY GREAT DIFFICULTY BECAUSE FROM THE STATION HOTEL TO GANAVON IT WAS ABOUT COUPLE THREE MILES TWO OR THREE MILES IN THE MIDDLE OF A NIGHT THAT'S NO JOKE AND SO EVENTUALLY I WAS THERE FOR ABOUT PER SIGNAL STATION FOR A BOUT I WOULD SAY ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE GANAVAN WAS OPENE GANAVAN SIGNAL STATION WAS THEN OPENED UP FOR THE RENS AND WE TOOK OVER FROM THE MEN I ME KNO WE HAD AN INTAKE THEN OF MORE V S RENS SO THERE WERE NOW SIX OF US INSTEAD OF FOUR AND WE TOOK OVER GANEVAN FROM THE MEN VERY VERY SPARTON WHEN WE WERE AT THE PIER SIGNAL STATION WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE MEALS WITH INTHE MESS PROPER MEALS ON WE MORE NIGHT WATCH I WOULD DO US UP NICE SANDWACHES WHEN WE MOVED FROM PIER SIGNAL STATION TO THE GANEVAN SIGNAL STATION WE WERE STATIONED AT A PLACE CALLED RASSY LODGE WHICH WAS VERY TOUGH GOING AMND THEY DIDN'T LIKE WATCH KEEPERS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T HANDLE US NEARLY ALL NEARLY HE WHOLE OFTHE M RENERY WAS WRITERS OR W T OPERATORS WHO WORKED PROPER WATCH OURS THEY WERE NINE TOLL FIVE NOR AS WE HAD YOUKNOW WE HAD TO DO IT WATCH KEEPING OURS THESAME AS THE NAVY SO WIF YOU WERE LUCKY YOU GET A HOT DINNER IF YOU DIDN'T YOU JUST HAD A SARDENE SANDWICH SO THE FOOD WAS PRETTY SPARSE IF YOU READ IN THE BOOK PEOPLE MY FRIENDS WHOV READ THE BOOK SAY WHY DID YOU STAND IT BUT I SAID BUT THERE WAS A WAR AND WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY DIFFERENT WE HAD TO GO DO IT WATH OUR JOB THE MEN IT WAS A ITWAS A VERY VERY SPARS SIGNAL STATION AM ADSHALL WE WANT ME TO DESCRIBE IT TO IS VESTHE SIGNAL STATION ITSELF WAS RIGHT ON THE TOP OF AGANAVAN ON JUST BY DONOLE DONOLLY HOUSE WHICH IS THE HOUSE OF THE A LORD AND LADY OF MCDODLE I THINK THEY WERE CALLED YES MAC DOODLE AND IT WAS ON THEIR LAND AND IT HAD BEEN BUILT AS A LOOKOUT POST I THINK ORIGINALLY FOR THE COAST GUARDS IT WAS A VERY SPARS E WAS TO ATUTER PLACE WHO HAD TO REACH IT BUT TO GET TO IT IT WAS A CLIMB UP A CLIFF ALMOST A SHEER CLIFF THE ROAD WENT BELOW US AND THE SHEER CLIFF UP WHICH WE HAD TO CARRY THE OLDEST LAMP BATTERIES WHICH WAS VERY HEAVY AND THEN THE AM WE HAD TO HAVE A FA COAL FIRE A BECAUSE WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO BURN ANY CONFIDENTIAL BOOKS WHICH WE HAD IF ANYTHING IF WE HAD ANY KIND OF AN INVASION AM WE HAD TO PUT THE BOOKS AND GOODNESS KNOWS HOW BECAUSE THEY WERE LEAD LINE THEY WERE SAFEFOM BUT WE HAT WWHILE WE HAD THE FIRE AM WE HAD A BUNK DOWN BELOW AND THE SIGNAL UP THE TOP AND WA A BALCONY ALL ROUND WE HAD A BIG TEN INCH AD THREE OURDIST LAMPS AM AN ARTY AT OUR TEA SET AND E WAS REALLY JUST GO ONOW THAT WAS IT WEW JUST PUSHED INTO THE DEEP END AM AND HOW FAR COULD YOU SEE FROM LARRY WHAT WAS YOUR V WE COULD SEE LITERALY THAT WHERE SHEHAD GOT IT WE COULD SEE RIGHT FROM WE COULD SEE MAL RIGHT TAWAY DOWN TO MOL OVER TO LISMORE WHERE WE HAD PERFECT VISION AM OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS COMING AND GOING WHY WAS THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANC STRETCH A COASTLINE IN TERMS OF THE CONVOYS YOU WER BE BECAUSE M IT WAS VERY SAFE AM THEY THOUGHT AM THEY COULD COME IN IT WAS IF YOU COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE MAP AM THERE'S A COMPLETE BAY AND TOBER MORREY THE ESCORT SHIPS AMUSUALLY POUT TWO OR THREE DESTROYERS WOULD DROP THE CONVOY OFF AND GO UP TO TOBER MORRY A THEY WOULD GO UP TO UP TER SOUND A MULL AM IF YOU CUN VISUALIZE THAT COAST LINE MULL ALMOST PROTECTS THE BAY SO HE ANY SHIPS PASSING HAVE TO GO ROUND BEHIND THE MULL THEY DON'T REALIZE YOU KNOW THT TECOMING IN LET'S NOLLTHE STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK AM I THINK IT WAS A VERY SAFE HAVEN AM THEY EY CAME IN AM THEY WERE ESCORTED OFF FROM US PROBABLY DOWN TO AMGOROKSEGAN WOULD GO INTO THE CLIDE FOR UNLOADING OR THEY WOULD MASS UP READY TO GO OUT ATH EITHER AN EXPECT T A OF ARRIVAL OR AN EXPECTED TIME OF DISPATCH THEY WERE EITHER COMING OR GOING AND WHAT WAS THE MOST SHIPS YOU THINK YOU EVER SAW THEM BTI DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE HARBOR WOULD BE FULL I WOULD SAY THIRTY ORTHAT YES THIRTY MOST LIKELY AND OF COURSE YOU'ED HAD O HAVE A LIST AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW YOUD THINK MEY MIGHT BE A STRAGGLER BUT THEY WEREN'T TAY NEVER CAME U N YOUD AV THAT WAS THE TERRIBLE THING YOU THINK A WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ONE AND WE HAD QUITE A LOT OF LOSSES UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN THE NOT IN THE BAY BUT YOU KNOW COMING AND GOING YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE TE YET BECAUSE WE HAV WE' HAVE A LIST SENT TO US WHICH WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL LIST AN EXPECTED TIME OF ARRIVAL AND YOU'D GIVE THEM ABOUT TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT THEY NEVER CAME YOU KNOW YOU JUST WONDER WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WERE ALL MANNED BY A MOSTLY MERCHANT MERCHANTMEN SO THEIR MORSE WASN'T VERY GOOD BUT NOW AND AGAIN YOU'D GET A A SHIP WHICH HAD A FEW NA X AM UNITED STATES WHEN WHEN AMERICA CAME IN IIT WAS BETTER PLANNED YOU KNOW THE LIBERTY SHIPS CAME THEN AND TETHEY WERE BETTER BETTER BETTER MANNED THEY WERE E A LITTLE BIT OVERPOWERING REALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO SHALL I SAY THIS OOVER CLEVER THEY USED TO SEND MORSE AT THE RATE OF KNOTS THINKING THAT WE COULDN'T ANSWER IT AN WE WOULD SEND BACK AT THE SAME RATE AM MISSUS WORWY DIDN'T LIKE THE AMERICANS VERY MUCH I'M AFRAID AM THEY TRIED ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY TRIED TO COME UP UP UP TO OUR SIGNAL STATION AND WE WE COULDN'T HAVE THEM IN WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM IN WE HAD ONE OR TWO PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE COMING UP AM ONE SHALL I GO ON E ONE NIGHT AM I COULD HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE THING AND A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND I THOUGHT INTHIS VOICE I DIDN'T UNKO WHO IT WAS AT THE MAN'S VOICE WE'D ALREADY HAD AMET A REN MURDERED INVERARI OR VI S REN MURDERED AT INVERARI ON NIGHT WATCH SO WE WERE ALL VERY WAR BY IT IN WHICH IND ON INTERSPED WE ALL WERE TAUGHT HOW TO HANDLE A PISTOL WE HAD TO GO ON THE RANGE WHICH WAS AM THE AREF HAD ARRANGED AND WE WERE TAKEN ON TO THE RANGE BY N INSTRUCTOR AND TALK TO FIRE A PISTOL AND I CAME VERY SMALL RISKS AND I WAS TAUGHT TO FIRE HOLDING MY WRIST SO I COULD FIRE ITH MY WRIST WE ALSO HAD A RIFLE UP UP IN THE SIGNAL STATION IT WASN'T LOADED HEAS NO AMMUNITION IN IT BUT THE PISTOLS WERE THAT BUT THIS RIFLE WASN'T LOADED IT WAS JUST THERE AS AS A WARNING I HEARD THIS FOOTS AND THIS IS PERFECTLY TRUE WE I HEARD HIS FOOTSTEPS COMING UP AND I SAID TO MY OPO I DON'T LIKE THIS VERY MUCH SO THIS BLOT KEPT KNACKING ON THE DOOR IN THE END CAUGHT THIS RIFLE AND I THOUGHT AN I CAN'T I KNEW IT WAS UNLOADED AND I THOUGHT NO WHAT AME I GOING TO DO SO I PUNNED HER OUT THE OTHER WAY AND AS THIS VOICE CAME THROUGH THE THING I LIFTED IT UP AND WAS GOING TO CLOG HIM ON THE HEAD WITH IT HE SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT JONE IT'S ONLY ME AND IT WAS ONE OF THE SIKNALMEN FROM DOWN BELOW STUPID WHO'D GOT A DATE I HAD CHANGED WATCHES WITH THE GIRL S I SHOULDN'T TELL TO TELLHER THIS REALLY HE OBVIOUSLY USED TO COME UP FOR A CUP OF TEA AT THIS TIME AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH HER AND HE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON WATCH AND HE NEARLY GOT HIMSELF KILLED AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NO I WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE IN MY RIGHTS BECAUSE WHEN NOBODY WHAD GOT A GREAT BIG PROHIBITED NOSONSE UP ITOFMADOR BUT I KNOW IT NEVNEVER EVER CAME TO ANYTHING AND I NEVER EVER REPORTED IT BECAUSE I WHEN IVE GOT HIM INTO TERRIBLE TROUBLE BUT WE WERE ARMED BUT ONLY WITH A PISTOL AND AD A RIFLE WITH NO AMMUNITION BECAUSE WE'D HAD A A REN IN INVERARI WHAT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T KNOW IT I'M AFRAID ALL THAT IS A NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WE WERE JUST TOLD TO BE VERY AWARE AND YO' TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS AND I THINK MENJ STEPNEY MENTIONS THIS IN HOUR BOOK AS WELL WE NEVER EVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED AND WE WE HAD WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A SPY OR A MAN USED TO COME DOWN IT WAS ALL PROHIBITED LAND FOR CEVILIANS BUT THIS MAN USED TO COME DOWN SIT ON THE ROCKS AND WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS AND HE HAD BANOCANS AND A CAMERA AWE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CONVOYS WE COULD TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AROUND THE OUR CABIN AND AROUND THE THING BUT NOT E CONVOYS NOT ALLOWED TO AND SO WE REPORTED THIS MAN TO OUR HEADQUARTERS BACK IN THE SIGNALBACK IN THE STATION HOTEL NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ABOUT IT SO HE HE JUST DISAPPEARED NOW WE NEVER EVER HEARD WHETHER HE WAS JUST A LOCAL NEWSPAPER MAN OR WHETHER HE WAS A GOMI KIND OF A SPY OR WHETHER HE WAS JUST INTERESTED IN SHIPS WE NEVER HEARD SEE I'M AFRAID IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS ALL NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD AND JUST YOU KNOW JUST PICKING UP ON THE AMERICANS WHIT YOU WERE UEE TO

METHODS OF ER OU NO COMMUNICATION E HAD THE SEMA FORYO YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LAMPS THERE YET WILL ALLOW SO JUST WWHEN DID YOU USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNICATION NE IS A ONE SPECIFIC TYPE IN ABAN IN THE STATION AND YER ALWAYS BY MORSE BY LIGHT OR SOMETIME BY AR T NEARLY ALWAYS RIY THE ARTY WE RE REALLY ONLY USED FOR THE ASDEC STATION AM LAMP MOSTLY THE OLDEST AND ALL THE BIG TEN INCH WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT OF COURSE TO HANDLE YOU HAD TO GO OUT ON THE BE AND OF COURSE IF UP THERE THE WINDS WERE ALWAYS AT GALE FORCE AND WE ALWAYS HAD TO HOIST THE THE CONES FOR THE WET FOR THE WEATHER EVERY DAY WE HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOR THE CONVOYS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER WAS WHAT WERE THE CONES THE CONES WERE WE W PUT OUT OF I COMB WASH A SHAPE LIKE THAT AND YOU HOISTED IT AND I CAN'TRERMEMBER WICH WAY NOW UPWADS FOR UPWARDS FOR THE NORTH WIND AND DOWN FAS FOR T SOUTHWIND VERY PRIMITIVE BUT IT GAVE THEM SOME IDEA OF THE WAY THE WIND I MEAN I ANOTHER THING YOU MEAN YOU COULD TELL THE WAY THE WIND WAS BLOWING JUST LOOK AT THE ENDS FROM WHICH WE ALWAYS HAD TO FLY THE WHITE ENSIN AND WE HAD TO BIDE BY THE COLORS OF THE WHITE ENSIN PUT IT UP AT AP SUNRISE AND DOWN AT SUNSET SO THE ENSIN WAS ALWAYS FLYING SO YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHICH WAY THE WIND WAS GO BLOWING WITHOUT THE CONE BUT IT WAS A GALEFORCE WIND WE WISED TO PUT THE CON UP WHICH SOMETIMES MEANT THE COMB WAS UP FOR DAYS CAUSE THE GALES WOULD BLOW UP THER VERY VERY VERY WINDY AND SOMETIMES WE WOULD HAVE TO BE LASHED ON TO THE TEN INCH HI BY OUR OPO BECAUSE IT WAS SO WINDY YOU KEPT BEING BLOWN AWAY IT WAS IT WAS VERY VERY COLD AND WE VERY VERY WE WERE ALWAYS WET BUT WE DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER DID YOU HAVEN TO GEVA BATHRA ARA TE O WAN WHEN WE WENT BACK TO THE GAT OF THE AM HOW LONG WOULD YOU BE SASSITUATED UP THERE WELL THE NIGHT WATCH WAS A LONG ONE WE'D GO ON SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT O'CLOCK AND COME OFF AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING THAT WAS A VERY LONG ONE AM THE OTHER WATCHERS WERE PRETTY WELL FOUR HOURS ON ON FOUR HOURS ARE OFF BUT THE NIGHT WATCH WAS IT WAS A TOUGH ONE BUT YOU SAID YOU HAD TO WALK THERE AN BAT FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO WALK WE COULDN'T BE OBJECTED BECAUSE THE MAN IN MEN IN THE ESTIC STATION DOWN BELOW US GOT TRANSPORT THEY WERE WORKING THE SAME WATCHES OH WELL YES OCAY THEN THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD ISSUE US WITH BICYCLES WHICH THEY DID AM WE HAD A REN OFFICER CAME UP TO SEE US AND SHE SAID THIS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND THEN THEY SUPPLIED TRANSPORT FOR US SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK THE NIGHT WATCH BACKWARDS AN FORSOF THREE OR FOUR MILES IN THE PITCH DARK ALONG A ALLE COAST ROAD BUT FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO BEFORE THEY REALIZED THAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING A THE MOMEN THERE'S A STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK YEROTHER THE DUKE OF YORK WUT WE WE NEVER HAD THE VERY BBIG SHIPS THE BIGGEST SHIP THA ESCORT SHIP THAT EVER REALLY CAME INTO US WER WERE DESTROYERS OR OR COVERT COQETTS AM BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS USED TO GO INTO MALL TO WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS TO GO BACK OUT SO WE NEVER REALLY HAD ANYTHING WHAT I WOULD CALL VERY LARGE I WAS ON WATCH WITH STEPHANY AM ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION AND IF YOU CAN PICTURE YOU KNOW THE ISLAND AND THE SEA AND SUDDENLY YOU SEE A GREAT BIG CROSS ANCHORD ACROSS MAS COMING ATUATYNG WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE AND WE HAD NO E T A FOR ANYTHING WE HAD NOTHING WHATEVERYTHING I WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY NO IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT FCOURSE WE CALLED IT UP NO REPLY COURSE THAT WAS WORRYING NO REPLY BECAUSE IS A SPECIAL EVERY EVERY HOUR TIT CHANGED THE CALL UP SINCHANGED ON A COD BOOK SO YOUWOULD CALL THEM UP BY THE CODE WHICH IT WERE FOR THE DAY NO REPLY SO WE HAD A LITTLE SHIP WE HAD TWO SHIPS ACTUALLY ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN STAR ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN WAVE AND THEY WERE PATROL SHIPS WHICH USED TO PATROL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AMONG THE CONVOYS ALL THE TIME THEY WERE OLD WHAT I WOULD CALL SOMETHING LIKE A CORVET AM I THINK THEY WERE OLD TRALLERS MEN WERE MANNED BY A NAVY AND THEY WERE AT WAT O IF ANY TROUBLE WE CALLED THEM UP IMMEDIATELY AND WHEN WE CALLED OUT THE SOUTHERN STAR SHE WAS A RIT WA WAY OUT OVER MALE AND ASKED HER WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHE SAID I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING FROM HERE CAUSE THEYE WOULD BE IN A WAY WAY BUT SHES I'LL GO AND INVESTIGATE SHE SAID IF IT'S ENDING TROUBLE I'LL PUT A SHOT ACROSS ITS BOWLS O THATWS THAT ANYWAY THIS THING GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER AVENTUALLY I MANAGED TO CALL UP I OBVIOSY THE THE BUNTING TOSSER THAT'S WHAT VISUAL SIGNALS ARE CALLED BUNTING TOSSERS WAS ASLEEP I SHOULD THINK HE THOUGHT O WAT WE'RE ONLY CAROZING ROUND THESE ISLANDS AND HE CAME BACK QUICKLY WITH D OF WHY INSTEAD OF A PENAT NUMBERE BCAUSE ALL SHIPS HAVE PENET NUMBERS EITHER THE PENET NUMBER OF THE SHIP OR THE COD WE CAME BAK WITH NOTHING QUICKLY DE WHY AND I SAID TO STEPANYA DE OF WH DUKE OF YORK I SAID GOSH IT'S A BATTLESHIP I SAID BAYS DON'T KNOW SO WE QUICKLY FONED OUR BASE AND THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE US CAUSE NOBODY HAD GOT ON E T A ANYWAY THE CAPTAIN OF THE ABIM OUR CAPTAIN O THEAT BASE CAME RUSHING DOWN TOOK HIM ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO GET TO US BY WHICH TIME SHE WAS IN FULL VIEW MASY CRAY IT JUST FILLED UP THE WHOLE OF THE BAY I'V NEVER SEE NYTHING LIKE IT AND O COURSE IT WAS A GREAT BIG HOHAR ABOUT THIS WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW BUT OF COURSE SHE WAS ON SHE WAS ON PILGRIMAGE UP TO NORWAY AFTER THE ERMISHAN HORST AND SHE WAS DOING THIS TO EMTI S'PPOSE SHE THOUGHT AL WE GOT THIME TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DID IT THEY WERE WAY OFF COURSE I MEAN IT BEEN NOTHING WHATEVER SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN THE COK THAT WAS WAY VERY WELL CASE IT'S VERY DANGEROUS OUT THERE BUT SHE DID SHE CAME RIGHT PAST US TAILING JUST OFF MULL I MEAN I COULD SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE SHE WAS IT WAS E MAP AM SHE JUST APPEARED BEHIND THE ISLAND AS IF IT WAS ON SOME KIND OF A FILM IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND IT'S SORT OF SINGIN YOUTO DREAM ABOUT LOVY STORY LOVEIS TOI BUT NOBODY EVER REALLY AGAIN GAINE NEED TO KNOW WE NEVER EVER REALLY FOUND OUT BUT WE REALIZED AFTERWARDS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHE WAS ON HER WAY UP TO THE BATTLE IN NORWAY DRINK OF TEA PLEASE E DE DAY OWAR ET WHEN DE DAY CAME WE HAD ALL THE SHIPS WE HADWE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT WHY THEY LOOKED SO DREADFUL THEY WERE ALL SORT OF BATTERED SHIPS WE THOUGHT WELL WE HAD SEEN SOME AWFUL SIGHTS BUT THERE WR THERE WERE ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY OF THEM I SHOULD THINK WITH WITH TWO DESTROYERS A DURBAN AND SOMETHING ELSE ONE ON ON WAS THE DURBAN A MONE WA SOMEIG MAYBE I'VE WRITTEN IT MAYBE SHE'S MENTIONED THEM IN THE BOOK ANYWAY AND WE THOUGHT GOSH I'D DESTROY DOESN'T WOLK'S TERRIBLE STATE SURELY THE NAVY KNOW THEER INWE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE THEY CAME IN I SUPPOSE THEY WERE IN ABOUT A WEEK OR MORE THAN THAT TEN DAYS ENOUGH TIME FOR STEPHANY TO GET TO KNOW THIS SIGNALMAN AND THEYSI MUST BE TEN DAYS M WE STILL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WH WHY THEY WERE IN SUCH I AND WHY THEY DIDN'T BECAUSE THEY ONLY EVER STAYED OR TWO OR THREE DAYS BUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A LONG TIME AND WE THOUGHT ALOW SOMETHINGS SOMETHINGS GOING ON THEN ALL OUR WE WERE TOLD WE W WERE NOT ALLOWED TO POST ANY MORE LETTERS ALL OUR LETTERS WERE TO BE CANCLED ALL OUR POSTAGE OUT WAS TO BE CANCELLED EVERYTHING GOING OUT FROM THE BASE WAS TO BE STOPPED AND WEALL LEAVE WAS STOPPED AND WE THOUGHT WAK SOMETHINGS IN THE AIR WE KNOW YOU GET THAT FEELINNG AM WE THOUGHT WWHERE ARE THEY GOING WHAT TEYR GOING TO DO OF COURSE THEY WERE THE BLOCKSHIPS AM A NIGHT BEFORE D DAY ATLEAS THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT OR SO THEY SAID AM THE NIGHT BEFORE AM THEY W ALL SEEMED TO BE GETTING READY THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG SHIP CAME ALONGSIDE SOME OF THEM AND TOOK OFF A LOT OF STUFF WE THOUGHT THEY DON'T USUALLY UNLOAD HERE IT GOES TO GOROK AND GRENNOK WHERE THEY WERE UNLOADING ALL SORTS OF STUFF WE WATCHED THEM THROUGH THE TELESCOPE UNO CHAIRS AND TABLES AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS WERE COMING UP WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS DON'T KNO NEXT DAY WE WERE WHEN WE CAME UP ON WATCH THEY WERE ALL BUSY GETTING READY TO GO OUT AND WE HAD NO EXPECTED TIME OF DEPARTURE AT ALL THEY ALL JUST SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR AND OUR TWO PATROL SHIPS HAD NO IDEA THEY SAID WHAT DO WE DO WHENE THEY'RE GOING WHERE WWUT WE WE HADN'T WE COULDN'T TELL THEM CAUSE I WAS SO SECRET AND THAT'S THE END OF THE DEDAY THAT WAS ALL THE BLOCKSHIPS GOING DOWN THEY WERE ALL THE ROTTEN OLD SHIPS THAT NOBODY WANTED THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD BEEN SO BATTLE SCARRED THAT THEY WERE ALMOST UNTHINKABLE SINKABLE SO THEY WERE THE TWO BIG BLOCKSHIPS AND THESE WERE SENT DOWN TO HELP OUT AND WE NEVER EVER HEARD UNTIL THE END OF THE WARL WHERE IT WAS ALL ABOUT AND THESE O OVIOSCLY THERE WERE THE BLOCKSHIPS A THING THAT YOU TOUCHED ON EARLIER BUT I'D LIKE MORE CLARIFICATION ON IT IS IS THA THA THE CONVOYS ESENCE YOU DID TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTATION YO CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN AGAIN FOR ME A YOU KNOW HOW THE PROCESS A DESPATCH RIDER WOULD ARRIVE FROM BASE IF OTHE STATION HOTEL WHICH IS THEIR BASE STATCHBRIDER WOULD ARRIVE WITH A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH WOULD CONTAIN E T A OF THE NEXT CONVOY COMING IN AND RIGHT SO YOU THEN GET IT OUT PUT IN FRONT OF YOU PUT IT UP AND WAIT FOR THE FIRST ONE LITERALLY TO COME IN WE EGHT EIGHT OH NINE HUNDRED REMEM PERHAPS THEY WOULDN'T START TO COME INTO O NINE THREE HUNDRED THEY'D OBVIOUSLY BEEN MARKED I SUPPOSE I THINK FROM IRELAND THEY WERE THEN SORT OF MARKED ACROSS WHOWOULD GET THE E T A OF THEM COMING ACROSS AND THAT WAS LITERALLY HOW WE GOT THE T T AS FROM A DISPATCH RIDER CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WOULD COME AM I SUPPOSE THEY'RE ABOUT EVERY THE CONVOYS WERE COMING IN QUITE REGULARLY
