what was some of the can you remember the sort of the first few journeys of what you did i mean did you go to norway quite early on the first trip i took saumarez was detailed to carry out an sweep whilst accompanying rms queen mary with churchill aboard on route to a meeting with roosevelt in quebec or at quebec but due to a typical atlantic storm gale force winds and mountainous seas we had to call it off after seventeen hours because it was because the conditions were so bad and resulted that we limped into st johns newfoundland four days after queen mary birthed at quebec so some baptism at my first trip to sea how were your sea legs i was never sea sick that was one thing i always boasted about i was never sea sick can you describe conditions in those seas well as i say it was very mountainous seas and the ship would be either up and down mainly going into the water and the water would cascade over the top of the bridge and all the down over the guns and all the rest of it what was your action station then you know at the time were you on or off that watch i was as i say on an oerlikon gun which was on a platform posted just after the after the funnel where you on an oerlikon in these storm oh yes yes really where you thinking i wish i'd gone to the air force at this point never never what was next well as i say led me kip out from canada we were attached with units in the fleet to carry out bombardments of installations on the norwegian coast which was our first my first taste of the war as it were and on retiring from the action we were pursued by enemy aircraft but fortunately they didn't press on too much so we escaped unscathed as it were is that the first time you got to fire the oerlikon i didn't actually fire because the four sevens the bigger guns kept the aircraft at bay you know but we were close up ready to fire but my range was only a thousand yards you see so that as i say though i was close up i didn't actually have to fire at that time what was it like to be you know although you'd done gunnery training can you remember what felt like to be on board when the ship really opened up in terms of the full bombardment what's the effect on the ship like it's obviously a lot of noise from the four sevens really it was a great deal because it was steaming and we were probably doing twenty twenty plus knots so that you got the judder from the ships firing the big guns firing but as we were closed up we concentrated on our own efforts we didn't take too much notice of this yes so we came after the norwegian trip then it was arctic convoys
