now while i was although i was a messenger renee sally and myself who were the three there and we were um taking and logging signals um mostly they were signals from say north african a lot of i learnt more about the human body i suppose then than i ever knew before you know because they'd come through wounded in action and they'd maybe give you the details most of the time they would sometimes they didn't and then they would end up by saying next of kin informed or not informed well we didn't do that bit we had to log these signals then get signatures front the officers in charge of um wherever you know whatever so from that point of view it could be very sad but you just had to let it ride over you you know but i suppose if you were over sensitive i don't know but we three of us coped alright but we were next door the sdo then there was a switchboard in there and um we were next door to the commanding officer who was um i think he was a lieutenant colonel then or he may have been colonel his name was so everybody said he was very strict but quite fair well if we had a turn of the giggles for instance we would knock knock knock on the wall and that made us laugh even more you know but one of the marines made up a little ditty about him and it went i can still remember it 'there lived a colonel long ago rejoicing in the name of poe but disliking this utensil he grabbed himself the nearest pencil and with a noise resembling glee he placed two dots above the e in this manner somewhat showing his staff now have to call him poe so and that was just a normal marine that made this up but did you get a sense of how things were going on in north africa yes yes you could get a sense of that you could get a sense of that with the number of casualties and so forth coming through where there any that particularly stood out to you that you'd heard the name or you knew of or well um the names i didn't recognise any but one of um the chief officer wren officer in charge now what was her name something like wainwright i think but her one of her sons was killed and she was a lovely person really you know you consider your um persons in charge are always nasty but she certainly wasn't she was lovely but she did have a a thing come through you know to say that he'd died that must have been quite traumatic for her then yes is the messages coming through to you coded no it came they came through on a teleprinter in full they weren't coded can you just describe the set up well the set up was a bigish thing you and then when you heard the thing um the noise when it started up you knew there was something coming in you know and then you had to wait until that was finished and then put time of tor time of receipt etcetera on there and um that was it then from that point you had to log it in the book and then that book was circulated to the officer who was responsible for whatever section you know um i can remember there was calver was one that got an awful lot of calls so he must have been in that section lieutenant calver c a l v e r but i can't remember all of them and were these were these specific you know were they relative to regiments or were they just literally everybody injured out in north africa well it didn't always say what it just gave a name and number you know but it didn't always you couldn't really say that they were seaforth highlanders or gordon highlanders or whatever you know
