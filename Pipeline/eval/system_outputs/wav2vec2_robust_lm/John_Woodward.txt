MY NAME IS JOHN DOUGLAS WOOD WOOD I'M EIGHTY NINE YEARS OLD I WAS BORN ON THE SEVENTH OF APRIL NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR WHEN IN THE SERVICE I HAD ORIGINALLY JOINED TO BE A SIGNALLER AND THEY FOUND OUT I WAS COLOUR BLIND SO I WAS AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE STEWARDING BRANCH WHICH I DIDN'T WANT BUT YOU HAD NO CHOICE YOU DID WHAT YOU WERE TOLD AND I GOT TRANSFERRED TO MINE SWEEPERS AND I WAS BASED ON THE ISLAND SHIP HERE AT QUEENSBORO QUEENSLAND QUEENSBORO PEER AND WE HAD ABOUT TEN MINES FEVER THERE AND WE WENT OUT EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS TO SWEEP ANY MIND THAT HAD BEEN DROPPED BY THE BOATS IN THE HOPE OF SINKING OUR SUPPLY SHIPS OUT WHY DID YOU JOIN THE NAVY BECAUSE I WANTED TO GIVE THEM THE FIGHT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND AT THE TIME I WAS WHAT THEY CALL IN A RESERVED OCCUPATION I WAS AN APPRENTICE AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER AND MY DAD DIDN'T WANT ME TO DO THEM TO JOIN UP APES IN THE LAST WAR AND HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED ME TO LEARN A GOOD STEADY TRADE BUT I WANTED TO GO SO AS SOON AS I WAS EIGHTEEN I WENT OVER FROM MAIDSTONE WHERE OUR HOME WAS I CAME OVER TO CHATHAM TO PEMBROKE BARRACKS AND A SIGNED UP I SAID I WAS NINETEEN BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE I JUST ACCEPTED YOU IF YOU COULD BREATHE IT OUT AND MOVE YOUR ARMS YOU ARE PHYSICALLY FIT I WAS TOLD TO GO HOME AND WAIT AND I'D BE CONTACTED AND ABOUT A WEEK LATER THE ENVELOPE CAME REPORTS A CHAT ON BARRACKS ON SUCH AND SUCH A DAY I WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE WAR WITHOUT ACTUALLY SEEING A GERMAN WE HAD A LONG RAGED FIGHTS WITH THEM BUT I NEVER ACTUALLY SAW A GERMAN BUT JOB WHAT WHY YOU KNOW YOU WANTED TO DO YOUR BIT BUT WHY DID YOU NOT JOIN THE ARMY OR THE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN EITHER IT'S A TRADITIONAL FAMILY MY FATHER WAS IN THE NAVY SO WAS MY GRANDFATHER AND AN UNCLE MY GRANDFATHER WAS ON BEATING HIS FLAGSHIP THE LINE AT THE BATTLE OF JUTLAND AND HE DIDN'T COME ON DECK FOR THREE DAYS HE WAS IN THE ENGINEERING BRANCH BUT THAT'S THE SERVICE I WANTED TO JOIN SO I DID AND WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF YOUR TRAINING A RATHER IT'S RATHER CONFUSED WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND YOU DON'T TAKE THINGS IN SO EASILY BUT FROM PEMBROKE HOUSE PEMBROKE BARRACKS WE WERE ALL MARCHED DOWN TO THE FURTHER DOWN THE YARD WHERE WE GOT FITTED OUT AND AT THAT TIME EVERYONE A LESS OF AN OFFICER WORE THE SAME FORE AND AFT RIG WITH BELL BOTTOMS THE SCARF AND THE AND THE THE HAT SENT UP TO SKEGNESS WITH ANOTHER BUNCH TO BUTLINS HOLIDAY CAMP AND THAT BECAME A S ROYAL ARTHUR AND I WAS TO START AND TRAINING TO THE TELEGRAPHIST SIGNALLER AND I'VE BEEN DOING MORSE CODE STARTED ON THE MORSE CODE FOR ABOUT A FORTNIGHT THEN SOMEBODY SAID ALL THIS THIS LOT HAVEN'T HAD A A COLITIS THEY'D BETTER HAVE IT MOST OF THEM PASSED BUT TWO OTHERS AND ME WE'RE ALL STRONGLY COLOR BLIND SO YOU'RE OUT IF YOU SEND THE WRONG COLORS WHEN YOU'RE SIGNALLING IT COULD BE A DISASTER SO THAT'S WHEN I WAS TRANSFERRED ON TO MINE SWEEPERS ON THE STEWARDING BRANCH WERE YOU DISAPPOINTED YES NOBODY LIKED BEING ON MINDS FEVERS WE ALL KEPT PUTTING IN FOR TRANSFER TO SOMETHING MORE GLAMOROUS DESTROYERS SUBMARINES M T B M G B BUT ALWAYS GOT TURNED DOWN YOU'LL DO AN IMPORTANT JOB YOU WILL STAY PUT AND THAT WAS IT HOW MANY PEOPLE ONE OF THESE MINE SWEEPERS AND WHAT WAS THE SHIP OF THE BOAT LIKE A FIVE OFFICERS AND ABOUT TWELVE FIFTEEN CREW THAT INCLUDES THE THE ENGINEERS OR THE STOKES BRANCH THEY CALLED IT SIGNALLING AND AND THOSE DOING THE ACTUAL MIND DETECTING WHEN WE FIRST STARTED WENT OUT MIND SWEEPING IT WAS A THREE DAYS ON ONE DAY OFF AND WE HAD TWO SEAMEN STANDING IN THE BOWS WITH RIFLES WHEN THEY SAW A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING BY THEY'D SHOOT AT IT HIT THE HORNS AND BLOW IT UP BUT THAT WAS WHEN THEY STARTED THE MINE SWEEPING CAMPAIGN AND THE GERMANS WHEN THEY DROPPED THEM HAD LONG WEIGHTS ON WIRES SO THEY JUST FLOATED BELOW THE SURFACE TO HIT THE SHIP IF ONE OF THOSE WIRES CAME LOOSE THE MINE WOULD BOB ON THE SURFACE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOKED FOR EACH TIME WE WENT OUT WHEN THE GERMANS OCCUPIED FRANCE A COURSE GOT RIGHT ON THE COAST LINE AND THEY HAD BIG GUNS AT CAP GRINER AND HE USED TO POP AWAY AT US EVERY TIME WE CAME OUT UNFORTUNATELY WE NEVER GOT HIT THERE WAS ONE AMUSING ANECDOTE OUR COMMODORE HAD BEEN A SENIOR CAPTAIN BEFORE THE WAR AND HE RETIRED OF COURSE AND HE WAS BROUGHT BACK IN AND MADE COMMODORE OF THE MINE SWEEPING FLEET HE HAD HIS TWELVE MINE SWEEPERS AND WE USED OUT AND DO THE SAME THING EVERY DAY THE GERMANS BEING VERY METICULOUS WOULD COME OUT WE'LL SAY FRIDAYS AND TUESDAYS NOT ONLY THE SAME DAY BUT THE SAME TIME TO LAY THEIR MINDS AND THEN DASHED BACK IN AND WE WENT OUT THE FOLLOWING MORNING EACH TIME TO PICK HIM UP AND THE SKIPPER GOT A BIT FED UP WITH THIS AND HE TOLD THE CONFERENCE OF HIS CAPTAINS ONE DAY IS THE NEXT TIME WE GO SWEEPING RUN YOUR TROLLS OUT BUT DON'T DROP AT YOUR WIRES WHICH IS OF COURSE CONTRARY TO ALL NAVAL INSTRUCTIONS THAT HE COULD HAVE GOT CAUGHT MARSHAL IF ANY AND BUT WE WENT THROUGH THE GERMAN MINEFIELD AS THEY'D LAID IT AND WE GOT AWAY WITH IT SO THE GERMANS CAME OUT AGAIN TO REPLACE THE MINES THEY THOUGHT WE'D PICKED UP AND THEY LOST FOUR OF THEIR OWN BOATS ON THEIR OWN MINDS AND I DON'T THINK THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY SPORTING IS THAT DOCUMENTED COMMENTED SOMEWHERE IN THE ADMIRALTY ARCHIVES ARE THE GOOD IDEA HE COULD HAVE GOT INTO A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR THAT WHAT WAS YOUR ROLL WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN WE WENT OUT I WAS A DUE TO REPORT WITH SIX OTHER STEWARDS WE REPORTED TO THE FIRST LIEUTENANT WERE DAMAGED CONTROL PARTY IF THE SHIP GOT HIT WE HAD TO CLEAR THE DAMAGE AWAY PUT OUT ANY FIRES AND PULL THE WOUNDED INTO THE WAR ROOM WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS WAITING TO DO WHAT HE COULD BUT FORTUNATELY IT NEVER HAPPENED BUT THAT WAS MY OFFICIAL STATION AND WHAT ABOUT BAD WEATHER AND STORMS AND STUFF DO YOU EVER ENCOUNTER ANY DANGERS WHEN YOU HAD WHAT ANY STORMS BAD WEATHER BIG SEAS WE HAD SOME YES BUT WE STILL WENT OUT YOU JUST PUT ON YOUR SOUTHWESTERN AND THAT WAS IT WE HAD SAFETY LINES RIGGED FOR AN ALP SO YOU YOU HOLD ON TO THOSE YOU WOULDN'T GET WASHED OVERBOARD WHAT ABOUT ATTITUDE WAS IT WAS IT WHAT WAS IT LIKE WATCHING THE PLANES TAKING GOING OVER YOU AND STUFF DID YOU SEE MUCH ACTIVITY IN THE AIR WE WENT FORTUNATELY NEVER GOT ATTACKED FROM THE AIR I DON'T THINK THEY THE GERMANS THOUGHT OUR LITTLE BOATS WERE WORTH WASTING A BOMB ON THEY WANTED HIM FOR THE CAPITAL CITIES OR THE AIR FIELDS WERE YOU INVOLVED IN DA DA AT ALL YES NOW A WEEK BEFORE D DAY THE BASE WAS SHUT DOWN LIKE AN OYSTER NOBODY COULD GO OFF DUTY NO ONE WAS ALLOWED IN FOR SECURITY REASONS OBVIOUSLY YOU COULDN'T GET ANY POST YOU COULDN'T MAKE ANY PHONE CALLS BECAUSE IT WAS COMING UP ALTHOUGH OFFICIALLY WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS BEFORE DID DAY ON ABLE TO INSTRUCTIONS BRIDGE STARTED NIGHT SWEEPING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DAY SHIFT SO THE GERMANS WERE GETTING USED TO THE IDEA OF US POPPING ALONG THE COAST DURING THE HOURS OF DARKNESS THEY WOULDN'T THINK ANY OF IT SO THE EARLY MORNING OF D DAY WE WENT OUT AT MIDNIGHT AND WE WERE SWEEPING RIGHT UP TO THE LINE WHERE THE BATTLESHIPS WERE WAITING TO BOMBARD THE COAST WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE STATIONED AND WE SLEPT THAT MOST CAREFULLY AND THEN WE AS THEY STARTED COMING UP OUT OF THE DARKNESS FROM TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WAITING AND WE RETIRED BEHIND THEM THERE WASN'T ANTIN ELSE FOR US TO DO WE GOT SENT BACK HERE TO THE ISLE OF SHEPPEY WHEN THE TROOPS WENT ASHORE WE WERE A BIT ANNOYED CAUSE WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING AND THEN AM ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE DAYS LATER THE SKIPPER GOT THE ORDERS TO PATROL THE DUTCH COAST ON THE SHIRT AND PICK UP ALL THE MINES WHICH THE GERMANS HAD SOWN LIBERALLY ROUND ALL THE COAST THERE SO THAT KEPT US BUSY FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS AND WE WERE STATIONED AT A LITTLE TOWN CALLED TERNUZEN A VERY SMALL PORT BUT THERE WAS A LONG JETTY SO WE COULD MOORE ALONGSIDE THERE AND IN THE EVENINGS LATE AFTERNOON YOU GOT SHORE LEAVE UNTIL YOU WERE GOING OFF AGAIN NEXT MORNING AND I'D NEVER FORGOTTEN THE THINGS WE SAW WE WENT ASHORE THE GERMANS HAD GOT OUT IN A HURRY AND THAT THEIR SIGNS WERE EVERYWHERE ON THE HOTEL LOUNGE AT BEEN AN OFFICER'S MESS AND THE SIGNS WERE STILL UP AND THEY BLEW SOME OF THE BRIDGES OVER THE CANALS AS THEY LEFT AND THE DUTCH FLOODED SOME OF THE DIKES TO STOP THEIR HEAVY TRAFFIC GETTING AWAY AND I REMEMBER ONCE WE WENT ASHORE WE ALL CARRIED THE NAVY RAINCOAT DRAPED OVER YOUR ARMS FOLDED IN A CERTAIN WAY AND THE OFFICER WATCH KNEW VERY WELL WE HAD THINGS IN THEIR POCKETS CIGARETTES PACKET OF BISCUITS A TILLER JAM OR WHATEVER WHICH WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN OFF THE SHIP AND WE WERE GIVING IT TO THE DUTCH CIVILIANS BECAUSE THEY WERE AS STARVED AS HELL AND LOOKED VERY ILL AND ON THIS OCCASION WE GOT ASHORE AND I SAW A VERY THIN AGE LOOKING WOMAN COMING UP THE STREET PUSHING HER BATTERED PRAM AND SHE GOT TWO LITTLE KIDS IN THERE ABOUT THREE OR A BIT LESS I SUPPOSE AND ONE BLANKET COVERED THEM AND I DOFF MY HATS GOOD DAY AND SHE GAVE ME A SMILE SHE COULDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH AND I COULDN'T SPEAK DUTCH BUT I TOOK OUT WHAT I HAD AND I PUT IT IN HER PRAM YOU SHOULD SEEN THE LOOK ON HER FACE SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS COME TWICE AS WHAT THEY DIDN'T EAT THEY COULD ALWAYS TRADE FOR SOMETHING ELSE COULD HAVE GONE BACK WITH MORE BUT IT WASN'T TO BE AFTER WE GOT RID OF MOST OF THE MINES OF THE DUTCH COAST WE HAD A WEEK'S LEAVE YOU WELL OBESE WE WEREN'T COMING BACK HERE FOR IT IT WOULD BE ON THE DUTCH COAST AND I HAD ANOTHER FELLOW WE GOT ON TO THE MAIN ROAD WHICH WAS THE BRUSSELS ROAD LEADING INTO INTO BELGIUM AND THUMB LIVES FROM THE ARMY LOWS WHICH ARE ALWAYS GOING UP AND DOWN AND WE GOT INTO A ABOUT THREE THREE HOURS TO A BIT LESS INTO BRUCE WHICH IS ONE OF THEM WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITIES I'VE SEEN I GOT TWO CATHEDRALS AND THE OPERA HOUSE AND THE TOWN HALL ROUND THE FOUR SIDES OF THE MAIN SQUARE AND ONE OF THE HOTELS HAD BEEN TAKEN OVER AS A NAPPY FOR THE TROOPS BED AND BREAKFAST SO WE STAYED THERE AND WE ENJOYED OURSELVES THEN WHEN WE CAME BACK WE GOT ORDERED BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AND WE WERE STILL LOOKING FOR MINDS WHICH MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED DETECTION GOING UP AND DOWN BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH URGENCY IN IT ANY MORE AND I DID PUT IN APPLICATION TO SIT FOR LEADING STEWARD BUT BEFORE THAT COULD TAKE PLACE MY DISCHARGE PAPERS CAME THROUGH AND THAT WAS IN THE EARLY EARLY NINETEEN SIX FORTY NINETEEN FORTY SIX NINETY NINE AND FORTY SIX YEARS AFTER THE WAR YEAR BUT UNLIKE THE ARMY OR THE AIR FORCE WE GOT PLENTY OF NOTICE WHEN IT WAS COMING I KNOW PEOPLE IN THE AIR FORCE AND THEY WERE GIVEN THREE DAYS NOTICE THERE AND THEY WERE OUT BUT IN THE NAVY WE HAD TIME YOU TOLD YOU GOT TO BE DEMOBBED IN THREE MONTHS WHEN THEY GIVE YOU TIME TO START LOOKING ROUND FOR A CIVILIAN JOB OR SOMEWHERE TO LIVE IF YOU'RE MARRIED WITH KIDS SO I THINK WE HAD A BETTER DEAL CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS MINE SWEEPING JUST EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WERE DOING AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MINES WELL HE LOOKED LIKE YARDS FROM THE MAIN MAST STRETCHED OUT EITHER SIDE ABOUT FIFTY FEET AND FROM THESE ARE DEPENDING VERY SHARP CUTTING WIRES WITH WEIGHTS ON THE END AND AS YOU GO TO THE WATER THE IDEA IS TO YOUR CUTTING WIRES TO CATCH THE MOORING WIRES FOR A MINE AND CUT IT THE MINE COMES TO THE SURFACE AND YOU DISPOSE OF IT HOW MANY MINES WOULD YOU FIND ON AN AVERAGE DAY ON EVERY AND POSSIBLY A DOZEN POSSIBLY ONLY TWO IT VARIED AND THE DISPOSAL WOULD BE A SHOT WITH ILL THAT'S WHAT I STARTED BY THIS THEN THE GERMANS EVENTUALLY AN ACOUSTIC MINE WHICH WASN'T MORE I WAS JUST DROPPED IN THE CHANNEL HOPEFULLY IN THE PATH OF ONCOMING SHIPS AND IT EMITTED A MAGNETIC FIELD FROM A BATTERIES THAT WERE INSIDE AND EVERY SHIP AS IT GOES ALSO MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD AND WHEN THE TWO COLLIDE THE MAN GOES UP SO WE HAD TO HAVE WHAT WAS CALLED DE GAZING EQUIPMENT A SPECIAL COIL FITTED RIGHT ROUND THE SHIP AND THE CURRENT IS PASSED THROUGH THAT ANTI CLOCKWISE AND THAT NULLIFIES THE EFFECT OF THE ELECTRONIC FIELD AND YOU COULD GO OVER MINES AND YOU'D BE ALL RIGHT COULD YOU FIND THOSE MINES WE FOUND HIM YES SOMETIMES THE GERMANS GOT CRAFTED AND THEY DROPPED SOME OF THESE MINES THAT NIGHT FROM LOW FLYING PLANS AND WE GOT BACK I WASN'T THAT I WAS ON A COUPLE OF DAYS LEAVE AND I WENT HOME TO MAIDSTONE BUT AM I WAS TOLD AS OUR SQUADRON CAME BACK FROM PATROL AND THE LAST SHIP IN SLID INTO ITS PLACE ON THE JETTY AND PROMPTLY BLEW UP BECAUSE THERE WAS A MINE UNDERNEATH BEING DROPPED BY A PLANE AND THE SKIPPER OF THIS LAST BOAT AS HE WAS ONLY SIX FEET FROM THE JETTY HE GOT HIS DEASY EQUIPMENT SWITCHED OFF I THINK THERE WAS TWO SURVIVORS BUT WHO THEY WERE I DON'T KNOW BUT HOW WOULD YOU FIND I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD FIND A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING IN THE WATER YOU CUT IT AND IT FLOATS SO HOW DID YOU FIND THESE MAGNETIC MINES WERE THEY ON THE BOTTOM OR THEY'RE ON THE BOTTOM YES HOW WOULD YOU FIND THAT WELL WITH A LIKE A SONAR DEVICE IT PICKS UP THE RADIATIONS FROM THE MINE AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHERE IT IS THEY CAN DROP A DEB CHARGE ON IT YOU SET THE DEB CHARGE FOR TWENTY FEET OR THIRTY WHATEVER IT IS AND JUST TO PUT THEM OVER ASIDE ON A WIRE GUN IN HOLLAND WHEN YOU GOT TO HOLLAND YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMORIES OF JUST THE DEVASTATION WHEN THE GERMANS GOT OUT IN HURRY THEY TOOK EVERYONE WITH THEM ALIVE OR DEAD AND BLEW A COUPLE OF BRIDGES AND THEN RETREATED TOWARD BELGIUM DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE WINNING THE WAR AT THAT STAGE YES THE GREAT DAY HAD COME THE INVASION HAD STARTED AND WE WERE PUSHING INLAND FROM THE BEACHES WE HADN'T BEEN SHOVED BACK OFF AGAIN AND WE WERE STARTING TO TO TO BITE WHEN YOU WERE PULLED OUT OF DADA DID YOU WERE YOU WERE YOU ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WAS GOING ON ON D DAY AFTER THE BATTLE SHIPS HAVE ARRIVED YOU'VE COME BACK TO BASE YOU KNOW WERE YOU AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR THE BUT THE GUNS GOING ON THE WHEN THE MAIN BROADSIDE STARTED YES I THINK THAT WAS A QUARTER TO SIX AND EIGHT MILES OF SHIPS ALL OPENED UP AT THE SAME TIME AND WE ALREADY GOT INFORMATION FROM THE UNDERGROUND AND RESISTANCE WORKERS WHERE THE GERMAN STRONG POINTS WERE ALL ALONG THE CLIFF TOPS HEAVY GUN EMPLACEMENTS BUNKERS FOR TROOPS AND SO ON AND THEY GOT CONTINUOUS PLASTERING AND THEY HADN'T QUITE FINISHED IT WAS A TWO HOUR BOMBARDMENT AND ABOUT HALF AN HOUR FOR IT STOPPED THE BOATS WERE GOING ASHORE WITH THE TROOPS DID YOU HEAR IT WE WERE ON THE MOMENT HE WAS BEHIND THEM WE HEARD IT ALL RIGHT IT WAS SUCH A DEAFENING CRESCENDO OF NOISE THERE'S NOT NOTHING LIKE IT WE WEREN'T EVEN NEAR IT NO WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER THE DAY OH THAT WAS AGAIN MARVELLOUS I WAS AWAITING THE MOB AND BECAUSE WE GOT RATHER MORE LEAVE ONCE PEACE WAS DECLARED AND I'D GOT EM I THINK IT WAS A FOUR DAY PASS TO GO HOME TO MAIDSTONE AND WE CAME UP ON THE TRAIN TO VICTORIA AND THE PLACE WAS JUST ONE SEETHING MASS OF PEOPLE EVERY COLOR EVERY UNIFORM EVERY THING YOU COULD THINK OF EVERYONE WAS SINGING DANCING LAUGHING AND WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS BECAUSE THEY LET THE HAIR DOWN AND IN FRONT OF BUCKING AND PALACE YOU COULDN'T GOT A SHOE HORN IN THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS STRETCHING BACK DOWN THEM ALL WAITING FOR THE KING AND QUEEN AND WINSTON TO COME ON THE BALCONY AND THE ROAR THAT WENT UP MUST HAVE GONE ON FOR ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES NON STOP AND REFLECT ON YOUR NAVY SERVICE NOW I'M I'M GLAD I WENT MEANS I AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS DON'T HAVE TO READ ABOUT HISTORY WE WERE MAKING IT WE WERE PART OF THAT HISTORY AND I THINK ITS SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF ARE THERE ANY OTHER STORIES YOU WANT TO SHARE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY NOW AS I SAY MINDS SEVEN IS A VERY DULL OCCUPATION WITH OCCASIONAL SHORT PERIODS OF ACTIVITY BUT UNLIKE DESTROYERS OR BATTLESHIPS YOU YOU'RE NOT ENGAGED PERMANENTLY WITH WITH THE OPPOSITE NUMBER WERE THERE ANY OCCASIONS WHERE YOU WERE ENGAGED NO WE WERE NEVER ATTACKED BY PLANES AS I SAID AND WE DIDN'T SEE ANY GERMAN TROOPS THE ONLY CONTACT WE HAVE WAS WHEN THEIR LONG RANGE GUNS ON THE FRENCH COAST TRIED TO GET US WHILE WE WERE MINE SWEEPING BUT THE THEY DIDN'T
