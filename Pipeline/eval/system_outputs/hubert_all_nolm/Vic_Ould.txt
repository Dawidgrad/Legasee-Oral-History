IWAS BORN IN LONDON AT CITY ROAD HOSPITAL NINETEEN TWENTY SIX M MY MOTHER TOLD ME THE SNOW WAS UP TO THE WINDOW CELLS I HOPE SHE MEANT THAT THIS WAS ON THE GROUND FLOOR ER WITHIN A FEW DAYS I WAS A POORLY BABY I WENT DOWN WITH DOUBLE NEUMONIA WHICH WAS ONE OF THE CHILD KILLERS OF THOSE YEARS AND THEREFORE WAS ON OPEN ORDER OPEN ALWOULDER MEANT THAT RM EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY TRACKED YOU JUST TO SEE IF YOU WERE STILL ALIVE AND ANY OF YOUR RELATIONS COULD COME IN AT ANY TIME TO ERM A TO SEE OWMYSELF AND MY MOTHER OF COURSE IN THE BED BY THE SIDE OF ME WAS STILL GOING ALRIGHT I WAS BAPTISED IN THE HOSPITAL CHAPEL AND FORTUNATELY I MANAGED TO OVERCOME THAT PROBLEM WHY DID YOU WANT TO JOIN THE NAVY ANDWHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND THER I THINK REALLY IN THOSE DAYS IT'S DIFFICULT TO M FOR PEOPLE TO SORT OFINVISIGES NOW A WAR WAS ON MWITH PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF U YOU WANTED TO FIGHT BACK ME SAD ET'AS LIKE A BURGLER TRYING TO BREAK INTO YOUR DOOR AN NORMALLY YOU'LL TRY AND STOP HIM AND I WAS DOING A CERTAIN AMOUNT WITH THE ARP AND I REALLY WANTED TO GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER SO ERM I THOUGHT ABOUT IT I THOUGHT WELL I'LL TRY AND GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INVOLVED SO I WENT TO THE LOCAL DRILL HALL WHERE THEY USUALLY TAKE VOLUNTEERS FOR ANY OF THE THREE SERVICES THIS IS THE ONE IN M EDGEWERE DENSBROOK ROAD AND VOLUNTEERED FOR THE NAVY I CAME ALONG TO PASS ALL THE TESTS I THINK THERE A LITTLE FEW WEEKS LATER AND M TH BE THEY ACCEPTED ME AND SAID A LETTER WOULD FOLLOW BUT THEY COULDN'T TAKE ME AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WAS ONLY EM SEVENTEEN THEY SAID THEY'D TAKE ME AT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF PROVIDING THE JOB I WAS GOING TO DO IN THE NAVY TOOK ABOUT SIX MONTHS SO I'D BE EIGHTEEN AT THE TIME WHEN I COULD GO ON BOARD A SHIP SO E I WHEN AWA STARTED WORK ON THE MONDAY

MADE UP MY MIND II'M JOING THE NAVY FORGET IT AND EM ITS ANOTHER BIT OF LUCK BECAUSE THAT FIRM WAS WORKING HUNDRED PERCENT WITH ASPASTUS AND AT THE TIME THERE WAS NO PROBLEM O COURSE I' FIND OUT LATER

THEY'D HAD QUITE ENOUGH TELEGRAPHIST TO FI ALL THAT THEY WANTED THEY SAID WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHANGE OVER TO SOMETHING ELSE I SAID WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED SOMETHING ELSE AND YES WELL YOU CAN BECOME AN ABLE SEAMAN AND FROM THERE THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS YOU GO IN FOR SO I THOUGHT I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT SO ALTHOUGH I WAS A TELEGRAPHIST M BECAUSE I PASSED THE EXAMS I WENT DOWN FROM THERE TO CHMESS GANGES GANGES WAS TOUGH YOU CAN'T SAY THAT HARD ENOUGH IT WAS TOUGH AFTER BEING IN SOMEWHERE LIKE ERM CIMESCOTIA WHICH AS QUITE EASY YOU OS IT WELL BECAUSE YOU HAD TO BE A NAVAL SEAMAN AND A NAVAL

WHETHER WHETHER YOU'RE FULLY TRAINED OR NOT SO MFORTUNATELY THE FIGHTING ALTHEGH T INJURIES DIDN'T GET TOUGHER THAN THEY WERE SO PASSED OUT AS A ORDINARY SEAMAN AND THEN AFTER THAT I WAS ASKED IF I

ARADIO OPERATOR SEEMED ABOUT THE NEXT STEP S ANWAY THAT WAS ANOTHER SHORT COURSE OVER THE ISLE OF MAN ES ALL STONE FRIGATES THAT YOUE BEEN THROH THEY WERE ALL STONE FRIGATES UMALL THE LAND BASES STONE FRIGATES SO SO FAR I'D NEVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP ONLY TLLITTLE WHALERS AND UM THIS TYPE OF THING WHER WE DID SAILING NLEARND TO SAIL LEARNT TO DO ALL THE KNOTS AND EVERYTHING INH GANGES SO ANYWAY BETWEEN THAT WEN WHEN I HAD EM FINISHED MY TELEGRAPHIST COURSE AND UM THEY SAID TO ME WELL WE'RE NOT SURE WHETHER WE WERENT ENOUGH TELEGRAPHISTS THEY SAID THERE'S LOTS OF OPTIONS SO I SAID WELL CAN I HAVE THE OPTION HE SAID YEAH WELL ONE NICE JOB THAT'S COMING UP NOWADAYS IS UM A SIGNALMAN ON LANDING CRAFT I SAID THEY SAID WELL YOU'VE DONE ALL THE TRAINING UM AYOU DONT ONLY HAVE TO LEARN TO BE A SIGNALMAN WITH A FLAG AND SO FORTH BUT I CAME INTO MY HEAD WITH THE VISION OF A LANDING CRAFT ANDME STANDING UP AT THE FRONT THERE FLAG WAVING AND THE GERMANS SHOOTING AT THE FLAG WAVE I SAID NO I'M NO HERO I'LL COME HERE TO DO A JOB I'MNOT A HERO SO ANYWAY SO I FINISHED UP AS A RADAR OPERATOR MTHERE WAS TWO TYPES OF RADAR OPERATORS SA RADAR PLOT AND THERE WAS RADAR GUNNERY CONTROL WELL AS A I CARRIED OUT GUNNERY IN GANGES ON BIG GUNS THEY HAD SIX INCH HEAVY GUNS THERE THAT YOU TRAINED ON I OPTED FOR ER THE RADAR CONTROL GUNNERY SO I DID THAT COURSE AND FROM THERE I WENT DOWN TO URM ER CHATHAM WHICH WAS MY BASE ANYWAY I WAS A CHATHAM RATING AND WAITED THERE FOR A SHIP WHILE YOU'RE WAITING FOR E SHIP ALL YOU DO IS WALK ABOUT THE BARRACKS HAVE JOBS LIKE PAINTING COAL WHITE OR SWEEPNG UP OR AL DIFFERENT PLACES AND YOU GO DOWN EVERY EVENING IN YOUR OWN TIME TO WHAT I BELIEVE IS CALLED THE OLD BIG BARN AND HAVE LISTS OF UM PEOPLE TO GO ON DRAFT UM FOR A SHIP WELL THE FIRST ONE I CAME ACROSS OFF OF GOING DOWN THERE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS I HAD MY NAME ON THERE'S QUITE A LOT ON THIS DRAFT SO WE HAD TO GO FOR SOME REASON TO HAVE A MEDICAL EVERYBODY HAD TO PASS FOR A MEDICAL THAT WAS ON THAT DRAFT WHERE IT WAS WHAT IT WAS FOR THEY NEVER TELL YOU THEY NEVER TELL YOU ANT THE NAVY IT'S KNOWN AS THE SILENCE SERVICE HEY NEVER TOLD ANYTHING SO ANYWAY HEY WENT THROUGH THIS MEDICAL EXAMINATION AS IT CAME TO MY TURN TO SEE THE MEDICAL OFFICER E SAID OUT O WAOUT S I STAND OUT ON ONE SIDE AD WAIT TI SOME TIME HE CAME ACROSS AND I SAID WHAT'S WRONG I FEEL ALRIGHT HE SAID YOU GOT GERMAN MESLS WELL MY GOODNESS GERMAN MESLES AND YOU'RE FIGHTING THE GERMANS SAID I'M NOT HAVING BEEN ANYWHERE NEAR GERMANY HE SAID DON'T BE FUNNY I OUT E I SPENT A FEW WEEKS IN A SICK BA I'VE GOT NO MEMORY AT ALL OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE I DON'T THINK ANYTHING COULD AVE HAPPENED BUT IF YOU'RE GOING ON THE DRAFT AND GOING ON THE SHIP OBVIOUSLY TWO HUNDRED MEN UPT ON THE SHIP OCOULD PASS IT ON SO A FEW WEEKS TIME SO MY NAME WAS M ANOTHER DRAFT AND THIS WAS FOR HMS CARAN AND MWE'RE NOT TOLD WE JUST MTOLD WE WERE GOING ON A DRAFT AND 'RE HAVING A NUMBER OF OF DRAFT SO WHEN THE TIME CAME THERE WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED OF US M FROM CHATHAM WE WERE PUT ON NAVY TRUCKS OENBACKWELL OVERBACK OPEN BACK AT COVERED TRUCK TAKEN DOWN TO THE LONDON SATION I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IT WAS NOW BUT ALL OF US ON ER ONE TRAIN I DON'T THINK THERE 'S ANY OTHER CUS ANY OTHER PEOPLE ON THAT TRAIN EVERYONE ATTHE DOORS WERE LOCKED WE WERE LOCKED IN AND YOUNG LAD BY THE SIDE OF ME SAID U KNOW WHAT THAT'S FOR I SAID YEAH STOP US GETTING OUT NO IT'S NO IT STOPPD THE GIRLS GETTING TO US WHEN YOEU GET TO A STATION SOTHAT STARTED THE CHAT WE GOT FRIENDLY NONE OF US EVER KNEW EACH OTHER WE WE COMEG FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE EL ANYWAY THAT WAS A LONG TRIP UP TO GLAD TOGOW GLASGOW WE STOPPED QUITE A FEW TIMES UM I THINK FOR A AIR RAD AND FOR NO REASON I BELIEVE WE STOPPED AT CARLYSLE AND MTHE WINDOWS WERE OPENED AN THE CARRIAGES LOVELY CUPS OF TEA AND SANDWICHES PASSED ACROSS FROM THE WVS OR WHOEVER NOW ANYWAY AFTER A A LITTLE REST ON STARTED THE TRAIN AGAIN AS WE DREW OUT THE STATION I REMEMBER THERE WAS BIG FACTORY BY THE SIDE OF THE STATION RIGHT ON THE TRACK AN OLD MILL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND OUT OF THESE WINDOWS THERE WAS BALLOONS AND HE GIRLS WAVING THE BALLOONS WERE NOT SOME OF THE BALOONS I CAN'T REMEMBER I THNK THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OF ANOTHER TYPE WHICH I WON'T MENTIONED BUT ANYWAY THAT WAS NICE WE LOVED THAT THE FACT OF BEING YOU KNOW CHEERED ON OUR WAY WE EVENTUALLY ARRIVED IN GLASGOW AND TE TRAIN CHANGED STRAIGHT AWAY OVER TO WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN A LOCAL TRAIN THAT TRAIN TOOK US TO GREENOK AND GREENOCK WAS OUR DESTINATION AND WE WERE THEN PUT INTO UM IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE YMC A A BIG BUILDING AND WE WERE THEN TOLD THAT WE WERE DUE TO UM HAVE BE THE SHIPS COMPANY OF A BRAND NEW SHIP A BEING BUILT IN THE SHIPYARD WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE YMS AVORITYMTA REALLY NOW IT WASN'T READY UM WE COULD GO AND LOOK OVER THE SHIP EANY TIME WE LIKED A MASSIVE WIRES AND UM PEOPLE WELLED ING UM AND II CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT WE DID WE MUST AV WALKED ABOUT GRENOCK ANYWAY IN A FEW WEEKS THE SHIP WAS READY ALL THE OLD WIRES AND BITS AND PIECES HAD BEEN REMOVED AND WE WERE GIVEN OUR PLACES I WAS ON THE FOREHEAD MESS DECK WE WERE POINTED OUT WHERE WE HAD OUR LOCKER WHERE WE PT NEW CLOTHES WE WERE IN UNIFORM NOW OF COURSE ALL OUR CIVILIAN CLOTHES HAD GONE SO WE JUST HAD AL NAVAL CLOTHES THE FIRST THINGS WE HAD TO DO GO THROUGH TRIALS THE TRIALS WER TAKEN UP THE CLYDE YOU HAD TO DO THIS SPEED WHATEVER DETERMINED AND A FEW GUNNERY T TRIALS ANYWAY WHEN WHEN WE FINISHED THE TRIALS AND THE SHIP WAS COMMISSIONED THEN INTO THE ROYAL NAVY THAT WAS THE TIME WE WAS GOING TO BE OFF NONE OF US WOULD EVR WAS TOLD THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO ON A CERTAIN DAY SO IF WE HAPPENED TO BE HAVING SHORE LEAVE WE COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY BUT THEN ONE DARK NIGHT SORTLY AFTER WED FINISHED OUR TRIALS WE SLIPPED FROM THE DOCK DOCKSIDE UM OF THE ERM THE YARD YE THE YARD AND UM EDGED OUR WAY UP THROUGH THE CLYDE NO LIGHTS OF COURSE CLOSED ALL THE WATER TIGHT DOORS ALL THE SCUTTLEALL THE DEAD LIGHTS AND WE WERE GIVEN OUR POSITIONS THAT WE WERE ON WATCH THEN WE WERE REAL SAILORS THEN SO I WAS STARBOARD WATCH SO THEREFOR I WOULD AVE BE UP ON THE HALF AN HOUR ON THE STARBOARD LOOKOUT WE WE NEVER HAD ANY ACTUAL TRAINING FOR THIS WE JUST WERE TOLD TO DO WHATWE WERE TOLD O ANYWAY WE EASED OUT OF THE CLYDE YOU HAVE TO GO PAST THE BOOM WHICH LET YOU OUT OF THE TLDE CLYDE AND I REMEMBER I CAME OFF WAATCH OR IHADN'T GONE ON WATCH I CAN'T REMEMBER AT THIS STAGE BUT I'D HAD REASON TO GO TO THE HEDG WHICH THE TOILETS I SIT OWN JUST SITTING DOWN AND THERE'S AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION BANG AND WAS ATA PULL ME TROUDED UP QUICKLY RUSHED OUT OF THE THE DOOR INTO THE MWHAT I CALL THE MCANTEEN FLAT THAT'S JUST THE PASSAGE WAY AND BUMPED INTO ONE OF THE OTHER SAILORS WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERIENCE OF ME AD IF WE BEEN TORPEDOED ON OUR FI NIGHT OUT NO IT'S ONLY THE TORPEDO AN TRYING A DEPTH JARDED OUT BIT SHAME FACED I DIDN'T GO BACK HE SAID WELL YOU AS IN THE RIGHT PLACE TE ANYWAY SO WE HAD A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT THAT ANYWAY FROM THERE AS I SAY IT WAS A DARK NIGHT WAS IT AL E SO CLANDESTINE WHEN YOU LEFT WELL THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THE ENEMY KNEW THERE WAS SHIPS BEING BUILT NEARLY ALL THE TIME AND THEY WOULD COME OUT OF THE CLYDE OR COME OUT OF THE THYNE OR PERHAPS COME OUT OF IRELAND AND YOU CAN VISUALISE IRELAND AND SCOTLAND AND IT NARROWS IT'S REALLY WIDE NOW IT'S A LONG DISTANCE BUTIT NARROWED AS AS A CONTINENT AND THEREFORE SHIPS HAVE TO COME IN AND OUT OF THAT AREA WELL THIS WAS ALWAYS THE PLACES WHERE YOU'D HAVE TWO OR THREE U BOATS JUST LURKING HOPING FOR A GOOD KILL AND WHETHER THEY EVER FOUND OUT THAT A SHIP FROM ANY SPIYS OR ANYTHING WAS COMING OUT AT THAT TIME I'VE NO IDEA BUT THAT WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS PART BECAUSE NONE OF US HAD WORKED TOGETHER WE'D ALL COME OUT OF TRAINING WE'D HAD GOOD TRAINING IN OUR OWN JOBS BUT OF COURSE NOT AT ATANING BECAUSE WE WERE NOT ITTHE SAME PEOPLE WE WERE TRAINING WITH SO FROM THERE ONWARDS YOU UP FOR HEBRIDES IT WAS REALLY MTHE U THE FEW SAILORS TATEXPERIENCED AND THE OFFICERS OF COURSE WHO WERE EXPRICED YOU HAD TO HAVE ALL THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO DO WHAT YOU WERE DOING ECAUSE YOU'D GET NO MESCORT YOUR SHIP COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN WITH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CREW THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TO SEA BEFORE NEVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP BEFORE VERY OFTEN SO IF YE'D BEEN ATTACKED AT THAT TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SITTING DUCK WHEN WE ARRIVED AT SCAPAFLOW WHICH IS RELATIVELY SAFE WE UM GO THROUGH THE BOOM AGAIN TO GET INTO THE FLOW AND FROM THEN ONWARD YOU DO OUR TRAINING ELL THE TRAINING AT SCAPA FLOW REALLY IS TO GET YOU WORKING AS A TEAM THE WHOLE SHIP HAD TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING A GUN CREW OF FOUR OR FIVE HAD TO KNOW HOW TO WORK TOGETHER IF YOUR IN THE M TRANSMITTING STATION WHICH IS THE ONE ON AN EARH CENTRES LIKE WE WERE AS GUNNERY CONTROL YOU'D HAVE UM ABOUT TEN PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM W'S ONLY THE SIZE OF AN ORDINARY SITTING ROOM AND MEACH ONE OF THOSE HAD A JOB TO DO BECAUSE ON A DESTROYER WHICH WE WERE MS COAM WAS A DESTROYER A BRAND NEW ONE AS WELL SO NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT M SO WE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE FIRE CONTROL TABLE AS IT WAS WE YOU GE EIGHT PEOPLE ON ITD AND ALL THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THEY'D TRAINED ON SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THE TRAINING THEY STILL HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT IF THE SHIPS ATTACKED OR IF WE ATTACK ANOTHER SHIP SO THAT WAS WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF US IN THE FLOW T THAT TIME WE WERE SO SHORT OF DESTROYERS IN PARTICULAR AND OTHER ESCORT SHIPS SO NOT ONLY WERE WE STAYING IN A I SAFE AREA TO DO OUR TRAINING WE WERE SENT OUT IN HARNESS AS IT WAS CALLED WITH ANOTHER SHIP THAT MIGHT BE MORE EXPERIENCE BUT THEN OKA OF COURSE THEREW'S ONLY ONE OF YOU HAD I EXPERIENCE AND ONE WICH IS TRAINING WHICH AS US SO ERM WE LEARNT IT THE HARDWAY ALL OUR REAL FIGHTING WAS AROUND THAT TIME AT THE END OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH WAS ERM OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER WAS AROUND THAT AREA SO THEY'D SEND US OUT WITH ANOTHER SHIP AND THIS IS IN ONE CASE WE WERE THE ONLY SHIPS THAT WERE IN THE FLOW DESTROYERS AND WE WERE OF COURSE DUTY DESTROYER AND HMS BULLON WHICH WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AT THAT TIME WAS A SHIP THAT HD G SUNK SO WE WERE SENT OUT TOU NO BASIC TRAINING ON THIS WE HAD A CALL TO GO TO A SHIP OFF CAPE WROTH THAT HAD BEEN SUNK WDIDN'T KNOW R AD BEEN TORPEDOED THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY OUR MESSAGE WAS NOT THAT ITHAD BEEN SUNK A SHIP HAD BEEN TORPEDOED AND TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO GO OUT TO TRY AND HELP TO CATCH THE U BOAT THAT SUNK AND TO PICK UP SURVIVORS IF THERE WERE ANY THERE SO THERE WAS TWO OF US AND IT SEEMED UMFROM THE RECORDS I'VE LOOKED UP THE OTHER SHIP THAT WENT OUT WITH US WAS ANOTHER SHIP THAT WAS ALSO WORKING OUT SO THESE TWO DESTROYERS WERE ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE AT AYL UM HAD TO GO OUT TO THE SHIP I FOUND OUT LATER IN LIFE IT WAS HMS BULLAN WHICH WAS AESCORT VESSEL AND THEY'D BEEN LOOKING FOR A U BOAT THE VERY U BOAT THEY'D BEEN LOOKING FOR HIT ONE OF OUR SHIPS FIRST SO HMS BULLAN THAT HAD BEEN SUNK AND E OTHER SHIPS THAT WERE WITH UR WERE STILL LOOKING FOR THE U BOAT WELL MTHE FIRST THING WE DID WAS UM OUR SKIPPER WAS VERY KNOWLEGIBLE VERY EXPERIENCED AND HE WENT TO THE POSITION WHERE THE U BOT WHERE THE U BOAT HAD SUNK HMS UM HMS BULLAN NOBODY WAS TOLD ANYTHING HE KNEW IT WAS HMISSBLE AND NONE OF US WERE TOLD SO THE FIRST THING YOU DO YOU GO ROUND THDEPTH CHARGE IN THE WHOLE OF THE AREA IN CASE THE U BOAT IS STILL THERE WELL WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH TOLD OUR ASDIC OPERATOR THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DOWN THERE WHICH COULD BE THE U BOAT SO WE DEPTH CHARGED THAT AREA AND APPARENTLY THE MECHO GODIDN'T MOVE IT STAYED THERE SO WE ASSUMED THAT THAT WAS A U BOAT AND UMNEVER NEVER CAME UP NEVER GOT ANY OIL NEVER GOT ANYTHING SO AT THAT TIME OF THE WAR THE MSNORKE HAD ONLY JUST STARTED SO WHICH HELPED THEM LATER ON IN THE WAR NOW THIS U BOAT IF IT DID' COME UP WITHIN TWELVE HOURS THEN IT WAS A DEAD DUCK SO WE WAITED AROUND THERE ALL NIGHT WITH A BOARDING PARTY READY TO GO ONTO THE U BOAT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME UP FOR AIR IF IT HADN'T BEEN AND THEN IT SEEMED WE HAD TO GO ON ANOTHER JOB I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE BUT WE HAD TO GO ON AN ESCORT JOB SO WE STOOD DOWN THE WHOLE TEAM I WAS LOOKING ON THE NEXT MORNING WE STOOD DOWN THE RM TEAM OF THE BOARDING PARTY AND IWAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE OF THE SHIP I HAD NO WORK TO DO AI WAS OFF WATCH AND I COULD SEE IN THE NEAR DISTANCE A MAGNETIC MINE FLOAT PAST BUT NOBODY' SHOT AT IT WHICH THEY MIGHT DONE USUALLY JUST IN CASE THERE WAS A U BOAT DOWN THEREWOULD KNOW HAT WE WES STILL THERE WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE ALL NIGHT YOU NEVER STARTED YOUR ENGINES ECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT U BOAT IF IT WAS STILL ALIVE DOWN THERE TO KNOW THATWE WAS STILL UP THERE WAITING SO IN THE END WE M WENT BACK TO UPAFLOW AND CARRIED ON WITH OUR M LEARNING TO FIGHT WAR TELL ME ABOUT CHRISTMAS IN SCABA WELL M THIS WAS THIS I TOLD YOU ABOUT WAS THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER HEN THE SMALL JOB WE MIGHT AV DONE THERE I'M NOT SURE BUT THE NEXT IMPORTANT THING I CAN REMEMBER IS A WE WERE EM NOT REQUIRED FOR WORK AROUND THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD SO WE WERE BACK IN SCAPA FLOW AND IT WAS QUIET AND WE WERE SAFE BUT NONE OF US HAD HAD A CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME BEFORE THIS AND THERE WE ALL WERE IN A DEAD PLACE SCAPAFLOW SCAPAFLOW TERRIBLE PLACE DEAD AS ANYTHING AND WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS THERE AS TWO HUNDRED ON THIS SHIP ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED SHIPS COMPRAMENT AND LUCKILY WE HAVE A FEW AMONGST US THAT WERE EXPERIENCED AND THERE WE WERE THECOOKS ON THE MESS WERE MAKING CHRISTMAS CAKES WITH WHATEVER STUFF WE COULD GET HOLD OF YOU ALSO MANAGED TO GET I'M NOT SURE WHERE FROM A CHRISTMAS TREE FOR SOMEWHERE AND THAT IS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE MAST ON TE TOP OF EVERY SHIP AT CHRISTMAS TIME IF THE'RE IN HARBOUR TY HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE WHICH IS RUN UP ON E TOP OF THE SHIP AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED I THINK BY THE OFFICERS BEING CHRISTMAS BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER WE WERE OR NOT AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE DRINK ON BOARD IT'S A DRY SHIP UT SOME OF THE OLD STAGES HAD SAVED SOME OF THEIR RUM RATION WHICH YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO BECAUSE WAS VERY HIGH CHARGE AS YOU WERE CALLED BUT THE OFFICERS NORMALLY ON A ON A SMALL SHIP LIKE A DESTROYER CLOSED THEIR EYES TO LOTS OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO IF THEY WERE ON A BIG SHIP THAT YOU CALL A PUSSA SHIP SO MANY OF THE LADS THAT WERE ALLOWED RUM I WASN'T BECAUSE YOUW'RE NOT ALLOWED RUM NTIL YOUWERE TWENTY AND I WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN MOUT CAME THE RUM RATION HORRIBLE I HAT IT M AND UM PEOPLE MADE UP THINGS OUT OF PAPER MI THINK M PACKAGING PAPER RED GREEN A BLUE CAME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES OUT OF HIDY HOLES AND MADE INTO DECORATIONS AND WE WERE MORE A BOY THERE AT THE TIME AND EING CHRISTMAS SONGS SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAD INSTRUMENTS WE HAD A SMALL BAN ONBOARD AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE I SUPPOSE A SOME OF OUR LADS WHO COME FROM HOMES THATAD NEVER HAD IT BAD I THINK IT WAS VERY TEARFUL FOR THEM I CAME FROM ER HOME THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY SO CHRISTMAS WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FOR ME SO ANYWAY WE ALL ENJOYED OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME AND IN A PLACE LIKE SCUPAFLOW SO THATWAS QUITE GOEND ND THE COMMANDER WILKINSON WAS OUR CAPTAIN AND EVERYBODE WOULD HOV GIVEN A LIFE FOR HIM REALLY AFTER WE'D BEEN WITH HIM FOR A TIME BECAUSE ALTHOUGH HE WAS VERY STRICT HE WAS QUITE HAPPY TO TURN HIS LIFE HE HE WAS A LAD THE SAME AS US M LATER ON IN THE STORY WHEN WE GOT AT FA EAST M I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT BUT HE WE HAD EM MULTIPOLO TEAMS AND HE WAS ON THE TEAM WITH THE LADS AGAINST THE OFFICERS AND THAT WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON HE WOULD BE AND HE WAS I THINK BOXING CHAMPION EROF THE FLEET OR PART OF THE FLEET AND ER HE WAS SUCH A NICE PERSON YOU KNOW AND THERE IS ANOTHER CASE I' TAKE IT TO IN A LITTLE WHILE WHEN I GO ASHORE SO BUT THE NEXT THING WE WE WENT ON REALLY AFTER CHRISTMAS AFTER CHRISTMAS WAS WHEN WE REALLY STARTED UM LEARNING THAT THERE WAS A WAR ON WE WOULD STILL GO OUT WOU'D STILL GO OUT AS A SHIP WORKING UP TOGETHER BUT THE FIRST ONE WE WENT OUT WITH I BELIEVE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND THIS WAS TO BE A STRIKE AGAINST NORWAY WE DIDN'T KNOW TILL WE WERE AT SEA TATWE WERE DOING THIS BUT THERE WAS THESE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS SOME MORE DESTROYERS I THINK AND UM SOME OTHER SHIPS NOW OUR JOB WAS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT EMONE OF THE CARRIERS BUT IT WAS ALSO TO ACT S M A LIFEBOAT REALLY WELL WHEN THE EM AIRCRAFT TOOK OFF AND I THINK A COUPLE OF THESE WERE OLD TYP AIRCRAFT UM I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF TBUT THEY WERE BIPLANES NOW THIS WAS A REALLY ROUGH DAY AND THEY TOOK OFF I WATCHED THEM I WASN'T ON WATCH ALL THE TIME AND I WATCHED THEM FROM THE DECK AND THE CARRIER WAS BONCING UP AND DOWN BUT THEY TOOK OFF AND I THINK THEY CARRIED OUT IR TRIED TO CARRY OUT THEIR TASK BUT THE TWO I SOR COME BACK DIDN'T MAKE IT ECAUSE THE SHIP WAS DANCING UP AND DOWN THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER DANCING UP AND DOWN AND I BELIEVE ONE OF THEM HIT THE DECK WAS PUSHED OVERBOARD THAT'S WITH THE PEOPLE IN IT THEY CAN'T TAKE THEM OUT PUSHE THEM OVERBOARD TO MAKE WAY FOR ANOTHER ONE LANDING AND THE OTHER ONE DISAPPEARED I THINK E WAS GIVEN ORDERS TO TRY AND FLY BACK TO HIS BASE OR A BASE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH TO LAND ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER WE I THINK BEING CRASHBOAT AIT WAS CALLED WE UM WENT TO TRY AND FIND THE AIRCRAFT THAT A DITCHED SADLY NO AIRCRAFT SO ANYWAY I THINK THEY HAD TO CALL OFF STRIKE ECAUSE IT WAS JUST TOO TOO DANGEROUS TO DO ANY MORE UM FLYING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO THAT WAS REALLY A BAD BEGINNING TO MY WAR WE WENT BACK TO SKAPA YOU TALK ABOUT IT BEING ROUGH HOW WERE YOUR SEA LEGS TERRIBLE I WAS SEASICK MOST TIMES I WENT TO SEA BUT WHEN WHEN YOUERE NWHEN YOU'RE ON E LOOKOUT OR WHEN YOU'RE IN THE TS WHICH IS IN CAM THE TS IS DOWN BELOW AND THAT IS THE TRANSMITTING STATION THAT TAKES THE THAT'S LIKE A RELAY FROM THE DIRECTOR TOWER WHICH IS RIGHT UP THE TOP OF THE SHIP THROUG U IN E TS TO THE MAIN ARMAMENT WHICH IS FOUR FOUR INCH GUNS SO MI WAS THE COMMUNICATION NUMBER SO THE DIRECTOR WOULD SPEAK TO ME THE OFFICERS TWO OFFICERS IN DIRECTOR WOULD BE SPEAKING TO ME AND I WOULD BE SPEAKING TO THE GUNS BUT APART FROM THAT UM THE DIRECTOR WOULD HAD INSTRUMENTS HA WOULD MSEND SIGNALS DOWN TO OUR BIG COMPUTER THE ORIGINAL UMMECHANICAL COMPUTER AND E MECHANICAL COMPUTER W SENDING THAT INFORMATION MECHANICALLY TO THE GUNS UM BUT ONCE I GOT INTO A POSITION WHERE THERE WAS EXCITEMENT FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT SEA SICKNESS I WAS OK SO THAT WAS A GOOD THING BUT NORMALLY IF I WASN'T RM O ON WATCH O STANDING I'D BE STANDING ON THE UPPER DECK WATCHING THE SEA HEAVING UP AND DOWN AND PROBABLY BEING SICK THE ONLY TIME YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS IS WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTIING ACTION YOU KNOW UM LATER ON WHE I TALK ABOUT THE MINELAY AND WE WERE ACTION STATIONS ALL THE TIME BUT IF YOU'RE DOING A JOB JUST ESCORTING THEN YOU'RE AT CRUISING STATIONS AND UNTIL SOME TROUBLE POPS UP UM DEPTH CHARGING U BOATS IS NOT A CASE OF GOING TO ACTION STATIONS IT'S ONLY IF THE U BOAT FIGHTS BACK THEN YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS SO ANYWAY WE WENT FROM THERE BACK TO SCAPA FLOW I THINK WE DID ONE OR TWO JOURNEYS LIKE THIS UOFF THE COAST OF NORWAY AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND EVENTUALLY ERM WE SUPPOSEDLY FINISHED OUR TRAINING OF WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM MIND YOU ALL THIS TIME IM TALKING TO YOU ABOUT NOW WE WERE STILL LEARNING BECAUSE WE WERE STILL TEAMING UP WITH PEOPLE THAT WE NEVER WORKED WITH BEFORE SO IF WE'D RUN INTO ANY REAL TROUBLE AT THAT TIME WE WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD A LOT OF CHANCE IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER ON WHEN WE A LEARNT THESE THINGS SO M THE NEXT ONE I TINK MIS AN IMPORTANT ONE IT AS IN ABOUT FEBRUARY I BELIEVE WE WERE JUST TOLD WE WERE GOING OUT I THINK THAT NIGHT WE WERE NOT GIVING ANY REAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE WE WERE GOING OR WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO BUT IT WAS A VERY BIG DO THERE WAS A VERY LARGE FORCE M WE LEFT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT I BELIEVE IS IS THAT O ER SCAPA THIS IS OUT O SCAPA AND THIS I THIS IS WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE MINELAND UM OPERATION UMIT WAS A VERY IT WAS AE ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO MOON IT WAS AL STARLIGHT SO IT WAS A VERY GOOD VISIBILITY AND IT WAS A VERY CALM NIGHT STRANGE OUGH HARDLY ANY ROUGH SEA OR ANYTHING WE SET OUT AND OF COURSE YOU SELDOM KNOW WHO'S WITH YOU IT'S THE SILENCE SERVICE YOU'RE NOT TOLD ANYTHING AND WE'D BEEN ABOUT OUT ABOUT AN HOUR I BELIEVE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AND THE SKIPPER THEN SAID OVER THE TURNOY WHAT WE WAS GOING TO DO HE'D OPENED HIS ORDERS AND HE TOLD US TWE WERE A BIG FORCE ONE OF THE LARGE FORCE FOR GOING DOWN THE SOUTHERN PART OF NORWAY TO EGOSAND AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY WE WERE JUST ONE OF TWO SHIPS ERM THE OTHER ONE WAS AZELIUS SAME SIES THE SAME DESTROYER AS WE WERE AND OUR MAIN ERM TASK W WE HAD TO ESCORT THIS EM MINE LAYER HMS OPOLLO EM FIRST OF ALL BOTH FORCES WORKING TOGETHER HAD TO PASS THROUGH A BIG MINE FIELD THERE'S A BIG MINE FIELD THAT WAS LAID I THINK BY US ERM AND UM WE HAD TO GO THROUGH ONE PATH THROUGH IT WHICH AS THE ONLY PATH THROUGH IT BUT WE KNEW WHERE THE OPENING WAS SO IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE ENOUGH BUT YOU DO GET LOOSE MINES SO OUR ASDECK OPERATOR HAD TO M PICK OUT THE MINES A AND I WAS ON WATCH AT ONE TIME AND I COULD HEAR HEAR HIM SAYING MTHAT THERES SOMETHING ON THE PORT SIDE AND THE CAPTAIN WOULD MOVE THE SHIP OVER A BIT SO ANYWAY WE GOT THOUG THE MINEFIELD ALL OF US WE NO REAL PROBLEM AND THEN WE SPLIT UP WE WERE TO WAIT UTIL TWELVE O'CLOCK AND AT THAT TIME TTWELVE O'CLOCK THE OTHER BIG FORCE W WE WERE BY THE WAY UP THERE DAVANGA AT THAT POINT AND THE OTHER BIG FORCE WAS TWO CRUISERS I THINK NNO AIRCRAFT CARRIED AT THAT POINT AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY AGERMAN CONVOY THAT WAS GOING TO LEAVE EGOSAND ADWAS GOING TO HUG THE COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO EM SSTAVANGA WHERE WE WERE BUT WE THE OTHER FORCE WAS TO STOP THEM GETTING THERE SO DAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK M THE OTHER FORCE WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE CONVOY AND THEY WERE HOPING IN THAT ASE WHEN THAT STARTED THEREO'LD BE LOTS OF FIREWORKS DOWN FURTHER ALONG THE COAST HIT WAS QUITE A FEW HUNDRED MILES BUT THAT WOULD TAKE THE HEAT OFF WHAT WE WERE DOING WE WERE A CLANDESTINE OPERATION HE WE WERE TO ESCORT THE APOLLO TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WAS GOING TO START LAYING MINES DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK AND WE WERE TO BE BETWEEN HER AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND IF IF SHE WAS SIGHTED ON BY THE GERMANS OR PICKED UP BY RADAR BY THE GERMANS AND THEY WERE TO START FIRING WE WERE TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS WE COULD AND TEAR UP AND DOWN THE BIT OF SEA BETWEEN US ABETWEEN THE APOLLO AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND UD ALL THE GUNS AND FLARES AND EVERYTHING YOU COULD TO TAKE THE HEAT OFF HER SO T'D ATTACK US MSO THE APOLLO M WOULD HAVE EITHER FLASHED US OR INDICATED TO US OR NOT ON THE SHORE BECAUSE YOU COUL GIVE EVERYBODY HAD TO KEEP RADIO SILENCE AND WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO SMOKE SHOW ANYTHING O WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO BANG BECAUSE THE NOISE WE WERE NOT FAR AWAY FROM THE COAST OUR TWO AND MBUT THE SHIPS BOTH US AND THE OTHER ESCORT DESTROYED AZELIUS HAD TO KEEP UP AS MUCH STEAM AS WE COULD BECAUSE IF THE FIREWORKS STARTED WE WERE TO HAVE TO AT FULL SPEED RUSH UP AND DOWN THIS BIT OF COAST FIRING WHATEVER WE COULD OPREVENT THEM SEE THE APOLLO WELL I COULD HEAR FROM THE GUNS BECAUSE I WAS IN THE UM R TS AND FROM THE DIRECTOR ERM BEFORE WE STARTED DOING AN YTHING AND I COULD HEA THE PEOPLE AT THE GUN SAYING WELL I CAN SEE THE HEADLIGHTS THERE THEY'RE JUST JUST OVER THERE A LITTLE BIT HE CA COMING DOWN GOING FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT AND I COULD HEAR ALL THIS THEY'RE SAYING HOPE THEY CAN'T SEE US FROM WHERE THEY ARE AND THEN HE SAID RIGHT THEY'VE STARTED DOWN THE OTHER END AND THEY STARTED FIRING DOWN AT THE OTHER END THEY ATTACKED THIS CONVOY AND RM THEY WERE BEING YOU COULDN'T SEE THAT WE COULDN'T I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING ANYWAY ECAUSE I WAS DOWN IN THE TS BUT I WAS GETTING ALL THE MESSAGES FROM E NOT THE TWO OFFICERS UP IN THE UER DIRCTOR TOWER BUT FROM MY MATES ON A GUN B GUN X GUN NY GUN THEY WAS FUDDLING IN ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE ME AN LOOK I THINK THAT BLOWE' SMOKING OVER THE YOU KNOW ON THAT O THEY CAN'T SEE US ANYWAY APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO MUCH U SO WE WERE SLOWLY CRUISING UP AND DOWN AND THE UM APOLLO STARTED LAYING OUR MINDS DEAD ON TIME DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK NOW THE MINE LAYER IT'S A BIG MINE LAYER THEY CARRIED A LOT OF MINE A BIG CRUISER THEY ARE AND ONCE THEY STARTE LAYING A MINE AND THATL WER WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME IN THEY CAN'T STOP THEY'VE GOT TO DO THE WHOLE OF THER MINE LAYING BECAUSE THE MINE FIELD IS BEING LAID SO THEY CAN'T TURN BACK THEY COULD ONLY GO ON AND CARRY ON LAYING THEIR MING SO ANYWAY WE'RE JUST GOING SLOWLY UP AND DOWN AND BECAUSE OUR SHIP WAS KEEPING STEAM UP READY FOR A QUICK DASH UP AND DOWN THE VALVE BLEW SO YOU GOT A NORMAL WATIS A WELL KNOWN DESTROYER WHOOT OOP OOP HOOP WHICH YOU DO EVERY TIME YOU COME IN AND OUT OF HARBOUR JUST TO SIGNAL AND APPARENTLY EVERYBODY WENT MAD THE CRUISER WENT MAD T WAS IN SILENT ROUTINE YOU KNOW AND MTHE FACT THAWE WERE NEVER TUST OUT NOT TO THE VERY END AND I THINK IT MIGHT EVEN BE IF ANYBODY A HEARD THAT WHOOP WHICH IS A WELL KNOWN BRITISH DESTROYER SIGNAL TO SAY YOU KNOW I'M COMING INTO HARBOUR OR SOMEWHERE THEY'D THOUGHT YOU KNOW CAN'T BE A BRITISH DESTROYER NOT BEING DAFT ENOUGH TO DO A THING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW SO ANYWAY M THEY LAID THEY LAID THE MINES AND THEN WE KNEW I DON'T KNOW BY SIGNAL OR WHAT SHE SAID ALL DONE YOU KNOW WE'D CARRIED OUT OUR MISSION SE YOU'RE BACK IN PORT AND I WAS AT THAT TIME LISTENING TO SOME OF THE ER AND THEY WERE SAYING LOOK AT HER MOVE AND SHE WAS DOING FORTY KNOTS SHES ONE OF THE FASTEST SHIPS THE WERE AND THEY COULD SEE THE BOW WAVE MINE IS TIS NIGHT BUT ERM IT WAS STARLIGHT AND YOU COULD SEE YOU COULD SEE THE SHORE YOU COULD SEE THE PLACE WHERE THE GUNS WERE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A CRACK AT US SO THEY'D KNOWN AND M AWAY WENT THE EM APOLLO AND M AT SPEED AND M WE TURNED AROUND BUT WE WENT AS FAR AS WE COULD BUT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO AT A GOOD SPEED BECAUSE WE GOT A SIGNAL THAT THE GERMANS HAD JUST OUT THAT THEY WERE BEING ATTACKED ESPECIALLY FROM EGESUNED WITH THE BATTLE WD ON DOWN NHERE AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE AFTERWARDS ON THE APOLLO WHEN I TOOK TOUCH ITH THEM THEY SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD AND THEY WERE IN THE EM EM WILLISE TELEGRAPHER OFFICE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT WE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED ALTH FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BECAUSE THEY'D PICKED US UP ON RADAR THE FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED AND HE THINKS THAT THE URM APOLLO WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF COURSE HAD GIVEN THE RIGHT CHALLENGE ANSWER BUT THEN THEY CHALLENGED AGAIN LATER ON AND DIDN'T ECAUSE THE APOLLO HAD STARTED DISAPPEARING SO THEY SENT TORPEDO BOMBERS AFTER US AND M THEY NEVER FOUND US SO WE GOT BACK OK SO THE MIN THEY AS SUCCESSFUL OUR FORCE DOWN M FURTHER ININCOSAN EGOSAND AND STOPPED THE CONVOY GOING UP TO GEM THE GERMAN CONVOY THEY'D UM SUNK ONE OR TWO OF THE SHIPS AND ONE OR TWO OF OUR SHIPS THATHAD INJURED PEOPLE BUT UM THE WHOLE MISSION WAS SUCCESSFUL IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU WERE EXPENDABLE WHEN YOU WERE OUT THERE O YEAH WITH YOU PILOT YOU ARE WHY IIT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A DESTROYER WAS A VALUABLE BIT OF KID TALK A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF DESTROYER AND IT'S CONFERABLE YEAH BECAUSE WAT WY SHOULD WHAT I SHELL BRING IN I BECAUSE LATER ON UM WHERE WHEN TOWARDS THE END OF THE WAR CAS OU WON'T BE IN THAT ONE ISWHEN WE WERE A BIG FORCE ESCORTING SOME OF THE CRUISERS OUT TO THE FAR EAST WE ONLY TOOK THEM AS FAS GIBRALTAR YOU SEE AND THEN ANOTHER FORCE TAKES OVER BUT WE WERE ESCORTING A BATTLESHIP THE RENOWN AND WE WERE THE CLOSE ESCORT ONE DESTROYER EACH SIDE FAIRLY CLOSE WHEREAS OTHERS WERE FURTHER OUT AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY LIKE THIS AND I WASN'T ON WATCH AS JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE BUT WE WERE QUITE CLOSE BECAUSE THEA CLOSE ESCORT YOU SEE AND I'M JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE AND OVER THE TANNI COMES E VOICE FROM THE CAPTAIN WE'RE NOW REACHING A DANGEROUS AREA AND THERE MIGHT BE U BOAT AROUND IF A U BOAT HA FIRED A TORPEDO AND THAT IS UM O NO A WE SEE THE TRACK OF THAT TORPEDO HEADING TOWARD BIG SISTER WHICH THEY CALL RENOWN THEN WE STOP IT YOU KNOW WHAT WE MEAN YOU STOP IT AND THERE'S ME LOOKING OVER THE SIDE LOOKING AT THE TORPEDO BULGE ON THE RENOWN AND THINKING YOURSELF YES YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE TWO HUNDRED MEN JUST TO STOP A TORPEDO BENDING LIT TORPEDO BULGE YOU KNOW OU KNOW JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF A DESTROYER WELL EL H ROLE OF MOST DESTROYERS IS THEY'RE FAST THE MANEUVERABLE AND THEY'RE LIKE A SMALLER VERSION OF A CRUISER THEY HAVE ALTHE GUNNERY BUT SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'VE GOT FOUR BIG GUN FOUR PNT FIVE BIG GUNS AND OTHER SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'VE GOT ALL THOSE THE ONE THING THEY'VE GOT EXTRA M APART FROM THE SMALLER SIZE SCALE DOWN THE BIG SHIPS HAVE NOT GOT ANTI SUBMARINE EQUIPMENT THEY'VE GOT TORPEDOES AND THINGS BUT UNLESS THEYARE SUBMARINES ON THE SURFACE THEY'VE GOT NO DEPTH CHARGES SO ERM A DESTROYER HAS DEPTH CHARGES SO WE'RE THERE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIFFERENCE THE REASON WHY YOU GOT A DESTROYER AS WELL IS JUST AS I SAID IF M CAPITAL SHIP OR WHATER IT IS YOU'RE GUARDING IS TORPEDOED THE LAST RESORT IS YOU GETTING INTHE WAY OF THE TORPEDO THEY'D RATHER LOSE A SHIP THAT'S ONLY GOT TWO TWO HUNDRED MEN ON BOARD THAN THE POSSIBIITY OF LOSING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MEN ON THE BATTLESHIP REMOTE AS IT MIGHT BE IF IT'S GOT A TORPEDO BULGE AND THIS IS WHY WA SO SHORT OF DESTROYERS BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM GGET LOST BECAUSE THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN A TORPEDO IS SIGHTED IS TO GO TO ATTACK THE SUBMARINE THAT FIRED IT BUTYOU SHOULD BE NEAR ENOUGH TO GET IN THE WAY OF TE TORPEDO IF IT HAPPENS TO BE HEADING YOUR WAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALKED A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WEREN'T ITEN YOU WERE VERY YOUNG CREW IS THERE A MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE ON BOARD WHERE YOU THOUGHT WE'RE WORKING BRILLIANTLY NOW WELL NOT REALLY YOU JUST SORT OF FIT IN PART OF LIFE IS YOU MANAGED TO FIT IN TO EVERY SITUATION IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH AND I NEVER WORRIED UM YOU THINK BECAUSE YOURE A GOOD SWIMMER YOU MUST BE ALRIGHT EVEN IF THE SHIP SINKS BUT THEN H WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU SPEAK TO OTHER PEOPLE YOU'VE GOT SHEA BOOTS ON AT THE TIME YOU HAVE AA BELT WHICH M SHOULD SHAVE YOU WHICH YOU WEAR ALL THE TIME AT SEA BUT YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT BELT BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT GETS IN THE WAY OF YOUR ARMS AND EVERYTHINGN SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU HAVE TO JUMP INTO THE HOGGING AS THEY CALL IT THE SEA THAT BELT MUSTN'T BE BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT MIGHT BREAK YOUR ARMS SO YOU'RE EXPECTED TO BLOW THAT UP WHEN YOU HIT THE SEA AND ERM I CAN'T SEE OWYO LUCKILY I NEVER HAD TO BUT I HAVE SURVIVORS THAT HAVE TOLD ME YES I HAD TO BLOW IT UP AS SOON AS I HIT THE WATER AND I HAD NO BREATH AT ALL LEFT SO I COULDN'T BLOW IT UP BUTTHE SEA BOOTS DRAG YOU DOWN BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE WEARING OIT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG EVENT YOU RECALL THEM WELL IT WAS REALLY MUNDANE MOST OF THE THINGS VEN AS ESCORT TO THE MONSTERS THAT WE DID OUR ENEMY IN MOST CASES WAS SEA WE GOT BATTERED LEFT RIGHT AND CENTRE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE E QUEEN MARY AND QUEEN ELIZABETH BECAUSE AS WE TOOK THEM OUT OF THE CLYDE WE ZIGZAGGED ALL THE WAY WITH THEM AND WE KEPT UP WITH THEM UNTIL THEY REACHED THEIR TOP SPEED WHICH MWAS TEDISTAN ABOT FURTHER THE WAY ACROSS AND THEN WE LEFT THEM AND WE EITHER WAITED AROUND FOR THE NEXT ONE COMING IN FOR INSTANCE WE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN QUEEN MARY OUT AND WE MIGHT AV HAD TO WAIT JUST A FEW HOURS FOR THE QUEEN ELIZABETH A COME IN AND MALL THE TIME ONE OF YOU MIGHT PICK UP ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU THAT'S THE QUEEN MARY WOULD HAVE ITS OWN ASDIC BESIDES ITS OWN RADAR AND WE OF COURSE THE ASDIC AND THE RADAR AND OUR COHORT PERHAPS THE CAVALIER WOULD BE THE SAME WELL WHEN WE'D STEAM OUT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE APART AT THE EXTREME OF YOASDIC CIRCLE YOUR RADAR CIRCLE SO YOU DIDN'T INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHER'S RETEAT OF THE WAVE AND IF WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUBMARINE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A WELL IMMEDIATELY WE'D RUN UP A BLACK FLAG ON OUR FLAG DECKSO THE QUEEN MARY WOULD KNOW AND SO THE CAVALIER WOULD KNOW THAT WE' PICKED UP AN ECHO IMMEDIATELY WE'D HIVE OFF TO ATTACK THAT ECHO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE IN TROUBLE IF IT IS IF THAT'S AU BOA HE MIGHT HAVE ALREADY FIRED ITS TORPEDO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU TURN OFF SWIFTLY AT FULL SPEED IF YOU CAN IF YOU GOT A BEAMC I YOU TURN OFF LEFT ALRIGHT YOU HIT WITH A BEAM A DESTROYER YOU GOT HARDLY ANY DRAFT YOU TURN OVER STRAIGHT AWAY SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY G YOU NEVER DID WHETHEVR IT LUCK OR IS BY JUDGMENT I DON'T KNOW BUT ANYWAY THEN IF YOU HADN'T BEEN HIT BY A TORPEDO THEN YOU'D FIND YOUR WAY TO WHEREEVER THAT UM ECHO WAS AND YOU WOULD ATTACK THE ECHO SO YOU'D LOOSE OFF ABOUT TWO DEPTH CHARGES FROM ONE SIDE YOU FROM THE OTHER AND ROLL OFF OFF THE TWO RACKS FROM THE REAR SO IT'S PATTERN OF ABOUT TEN CHARGES WELL IF THE U BOAT IS A VERY EXPERIENCED ONE AND HE WAS WATCHING YOU ON THE PERISCOPE HE WOULDN'T BE THERE WHEN YOU ARRIVED HE WOULD EITHER HAVE GONE DOWN LOW OR HE WOULD HAFE DISAPPEARED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BUT AT LEAST YOU KEPT HIM DOWN HERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM HITTING YOUR CHARGE AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO TRY TO CATCH IT UP TAKE ABOUT HALF A DAY BECAUSE THEY'RE KEEPING THE SAME SPEED EVEN IF THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO LEAVE THE QUEEN MARY OR THE QUEEN ELIZABETH THE QUEEN MARY WOULD CARRY ON IT WOULDN'T STOP AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY'D ACTUALLY TORPEDOED TO QUEEN MARY THEN THEY WOULD HAVE LOST A LOT OF LIVES BECAUSE WHILE YOURE THE QUEEN MARY IF IT'S COMING BACK IN YOU'LD HAVE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF AMERICAN GIVES AND AT WOULD BE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND BE CARRYING NOW THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TIGHTEN UP THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BECAUSE THEY' GOING FROM THE DIFFERENT DECKS ALL THE TIME IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF WE GO INTO ACTION STATIONS THEN WE CLOSE OUR WATER TIGHT DOORS WHICH MEANS IF YOU TORPEDO AR MIND IT WILL ONLY DAMAGE THE COMPARTMENT WE YOUR WITHIN SO THE SHIP MOST LIKELY WON'T SINK BUT IF IT'S ON THE QUEEN MARY THEY AV GOT NO CHANCE OF ANY OF THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BEING CLOSED BECAUSE THEY'RE TRAVELLING BETWEEN HE DEFINIT DIFFERENT DECKS TER PERHAPS SLEEPING ON ONE DECK TRAVELLING UP THE NECKDECK TO EACH FOOD ANOTHER DECK FOR EXRCISE THE TOP DECK IS ALWAYS EXISE T COULDN'T OF CLOSED THEIR W FARTY TIGHT DOORS SO ANY OF THOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISASTERS YOU'D FIND WHAT WAS IT LIKE SEEING THE QUEEN MARY QUEEN F ELIZABETH SAILING DID YOU HAVE ANY PRIME O DO WITH THEM WERE THESE SHIPS TAT YOU KNEW OF AND WERE PROUD OF ANYWHERE WELL EM ALL ALL WE REALLY KNEW WAS THAT WE WAS GOING TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS OR BRING ONE OF THE MONSTER OING OR O IF IT WAS THE QUEEN MARY AND WE WERE IN GREENOCK THEN WE WOULD KNOW IS THE GWHERE WE WERE TAKEN OUT AND THAT'S ALLWAY'S GOT THREE FUNNELS ANYWAY IF WE PICKED UP IF IT'S GOT THREE FUNNELS IT'S QUEEN MARY AD HET'S GOT TWO FUNNELS IT'S QUEEN ELIZABETH AND SO ON YOU HAT FOUR FOUR FUNNELS WITH THE AQUITANIA AND SO IT WENT ON BUT YOU WERE NEVER TOLD YOU WOULD JUST SAIL OUT AND EM GO TO A RENDEZVOOS WERE YOU'D WAIT AROUND OR YOU' ALREADY CONTACTED THAT SHIP TO SAY YOU'RE THERE AND YOU BRING IT IN VERY OFTEN EVEN WE TWO ESCORTS ONE WOULD BE GREENOCK AT THE CLYDE AND THE OTHER BE DOWN AT LIVERPOOL AND WE WOULD REACH A POINT OF RENDEZVOOS GOING OUT OF THE CLYDE AND THE OTHER ONE THE CAVALIER PERHAPS COME OUT OF LIVERPOOL AD THEN WE'D STEAM UP TOGETHER TO EM RENDEVOO POINT FOR M THE MONSTER ID THIS HAPPEN ALMOST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK OR MONE OR OTHER OF US WE NEVER HAD THE SAME COHARLT UM BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T ALWAYS BE IN THE SAME AREA THEY'D BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE AND BETWEEN THAT IF YOUR DUTY SHIP IF ERM THERE WAS AIRCRAFT CARRIER WHICH HAPPENED IN ONE CASE UMHAD BEEN TORPEDOD WE' JUST COME DOWN FROM SCAPA TO TO GREENOCK AND WE'D JUST ARRRIVED AT THE HARBOUR ENTRANCE WE WENT STRAIGHT TO AN OILAR BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO FILL UP WITH OIL BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO OUT AND JUST AS WE WER AT THE OILA WE GOT AN EMERGENCY CORNWALL TO SAY THAT M AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER HAD BEEN TORPEDOED JUST OUT IN M CLYDE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CLYE SO WE UM JUST LET GO FROM THE OILER AND WE WENT STRAIGHT OUT TO TO THE THANE IT WAS A AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND STRANGELY ENOUGH SHE WAS ON HER OWN SHE'D COME FROM LONDERRY SHE'D HAD NO ESCORT LUCKILY SHE DIDN'T HAVE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF E OF SEAMAN AND SO FORTH AND SHE WAS COMING TO EM TO THE CLA I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY TORPEDOED THT HE TORPEDOED M A MERCHANT SHIP AT THE SAME TIME AND THE U BOAT GOT AWAY ALTHOUGH WE WENT TO ATTACK IT AND IT WAS DARK AND ER WELEFT THE OTHERS I THINK LOOKING FOR THE U BOAT AFTERARD WHER WE CA GOING BACK INTO HARBOUR HOW LONG ARE YOU AT SEA WHEN YOU WERE OUT IN THE ATLANTIC HOW OFTEN YOU GOING BACK TO BASE AND ING LAND LONTH IN A DESTROYER NOT VERY LONG BECAUSE YOU HAVN'T GOT THAT MUCH FUEL AND EE ALWAYS USALLING YOU STOP SPEED ALWAYS MANEUVERING YOUR ONLY WAY OF GETTING FUEL IF YOU'RE OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS FROM ONE OF THE BIGGER SHIPS EITHER FROM AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER OR SOMETHINGAS BIG AS A BELFAST A CRUISER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ALSO FOOD YOUR FOOD RUNS OUT AFTER A SHORT WHILE SO THE ONLY TIME WE WERE REALLY OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS UM WHEN WE WAS UP AT SCAPA WHEN WE WAS UM WORKING UP AND WHEN WE WAS GOING OUT ON EM FORAYS TO ELP TO SINK THE ERPITS OR DOING OTHER JOBS ER MOST OF THE OTHERS IT WAS A CASE OF GOING OUT JUST FOR A DAY OR TWO TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS AND THEN COME BACK WITH THE MONSTER OR TAKE ONE OUT AND LEAVE IT IN WHICH CASE YOEU'D HAVE TO GO TO LONDON DERRY PERHAPS AND THEN W COME OUT OF LONDON DERRY AGAIN AND YOUKNO GO OUT ON THAT SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT RESPECT NO WE WERE NOT OUT FOR VERY LONG THERE WAS ONLY EM ONE OCCASION WHEN WE WAS OUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME IT MUST HAVE BEEN OVER FIVE DAYS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE OCCASION WAS BUT WE HAD RUN OUT OF FOOD AND E WAS FURTHER UP IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND OUR CAPTAIN WAS AN X FISHRY FLEET MAN HE HAD HIS OWN FISHERY FLEET THEN SO WHAT HE DECIDED TO DO AS WE WE RUN OUT OF FOOD HE SAID I KNOW WHERE THE FISH EM ARE SO HE GUIDED THE SHIP UP TO WHERE HE KNEW THEY WERE PICKED UP A SHOON THE RADAR ON THE ASDEC DROPPED TO DDEPTH HA LOWERED THE BOAT PICKED UP AL L THE FISH THAT CAME UP THAT STUNNED HE STOOD ON THE FOAL WE SAW HIM SATIN ON THE FOALE AND SAID UP MY MIND ICKED THE BIGGEST ONE WE LIVED ON FISH FOR A FEW MORE DAYS AFTER THAT SO TE WONE VERY GOOD BUT OUR RUNS WERE MOSTLY JUST ABOUT FIVE DAYS AT THA TIM BUT THAT MEANT AEVERY TIME WE CAME INTO THE ER REITHER SCAPE OR IF WE WERE IN LIVERPOOL OR TO DE CLYDE WE HAD TO ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF FUEL ON BOARD BECAUSE IF YOUERE ASHORE AND A DUTY DESTROYER AND THEN IF SOMETHING COMES UP WHERE A SHIPS BEEN SUNK YOU HAVD TO GO OUT STRAIGHT AWAY AND YOU MIGHT BE OUT FOR A LONG TIME LOOKING FOR A SUBMARINE OR MORE THAN ON SUBMARINE SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THE FACT TAT WE NEVER WENT OUT FOR A LONG TIME OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OILING AT SEA WHICH IS A DANGEROUS PRACTICE ANYWAY AND EPICKING UP FOOD AND EVERYTHING FROM IT CAN YOU DESCRIBE RADAR YES ERM THIS WIS THE JOB YOU WERE DOIG RADAR YES RADY AR YI DOING WELL FIRST OF ALL WHEN I WAS ON THE RADAR SET IT WAS ONLY A SMALL SET AND E IT 'RE DIFFERENT TYPES THE TWO NINE THREE THAT IS HIGH UP ON THE MAST AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY YOR PICKING UP UM AIRCRAFT OR SURFACE SHIP REALLY Y DISTANT I AN CAN'T THINK OF THE RANGE OF IT BUT IT SENDS OUT A SIGNAL FROM THERE WHICH OF COURSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT ANYTHING YOU DON'T GET IT BACK BUT IF IT HITS ANYTHING EVEN CLIFFS OR AN AIRCRAST OR A SURFACE SHIP THEN IT BAANCES BACK AND ON THE SCREEN VE UM WHICH IS AROUND SCREEN AND THE THE CURSERIS GOING ROUND ALL THE TIME THAT WILL SHOW A BLP AND THAT BLIP YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S UM A CLOUD WHICH IT MIGHT BE IT DEPENDS ON YOUR RADAR WET IT'S DOING VERTICAL OR ANGLAR AND YOU WILL THEN READ OFF THE DISTANCE AND THE ANGLE OF EVERYTHING IF THIS IS MOSTLY ONON A LEVEL BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER SCREAM WHICH GIVES YOU THE HEIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT SO YOU USE ONE WITH THE OTHER THAT A EM WHEN THAT ERM SIGNAL ELECTRONIC SIGNAL HITS ANYTHING THEN IT RETURNS AND THEN YOU READ OFF THE DISTANCE OF IT BUT ITEN FO O IT AD NOT IT'S EASIER TO USE UM WER WHERE YOU FIND A DIFFICULTY IS BY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT EITHER LAND BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF IT ON THERE OR IF IT'S A SMALL BLIP THEN IT'S AN AIRCRAFT A SHIP OR WHATEVER IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE USING ONE TYPE OF RADAR IT'S ONLY UM IT'S ONLY HORIZONTAL IF YOU'RE USING ANOTHER ONE IT CAN BE A HORIZONTAL OR AN AIRCRAFT AND IT WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD DISTANCE THE TIME IT TAKES OF COURSE IT'S BASED ON IF IT TAKES TEN SECONDS TGET FROM THERE TO THERE THEN IT'S AND YOU READ IT O FROM THE SCREEN LUCKILY AT OUR POINT IN THE WAR WE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH AIRCRAFT THE ONLY TIME WO WOULD HAVE HAD PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IF THE TORPEDO BOMBERS HAD BEEN SENT AFTER US OFF NORWAY THEN YO WOULD HAVE HAD TO USE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD KNOW THE YEU'D HAVE TO USE THE TWO RADAR SETS THEN THE ONE THACH GIVES YOU A SIGNAL WITH THE HEIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT ND THE OTHER ONE WHICH GIVES YOU DISTANCE OF IT THEN YOU'RE TRAINED TO KNOW WHICH THE DIFFERENCE AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT AS FAR AS IN REMEMBER IF IT WAS ONE OF OUR OWN AIRCRAFT IT WOULD HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION SIGNAL WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW ON YOUR RADAR SET BEFORE IT GOT TO YOU SO YOU'D HAVE TO HA PRETTY WELL EXPERIENCED BUT MY TIME WAS NOT ALWAYS ON A RADAR SET YOU WERE SOMETIMES A LOOKOUT AS A SEAMAN YWHERE YOUW'RE SITTING UP IN A LOOKOUT BOX ON THE STARBOARD SIDE WASH MINE AND YOU'E LOOKING OUT FOR AIRCRAFT WHICH WAS NOT VERY OFTEN WE SAW EM SURFACE SHIPS OR MORE THAN LIKELY YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR A A LITTLE TINY PERISCOPE WHICH IS VERY HARD TO SEE IN A ROUGHATLANTIC OR YOU MIGHT BE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE THE TRACK OF A TORPEDO COMING TOWARD YOU IN WHICH CASE YOU GET INTO A PANIC AND CALL OUT QUICKLY TO THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE M THE CAPTAIN OR THE EM OFFICER OTE OF THE WATCH AT THE TIME IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE NOW DAYS IT'S ENCLOSED BUT IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE SO THE BRIDGE IS HERE YOU'VE GOT A LOOKOUT ON JUST HERE TO YO JUST CALL OUT TO THAT PERSON ON THE BRIDGE OFFICER SHIP BEARING RED FIVE O GREEN FIVEO WE YOUR POSITION IS ANGLE OF SIGHT IF IT'S AN AIRCRAFT AND YOU'D IMMEDIATELY LOOK AT IT AND DECIDE WHAT ACTION TO TAKE BUT IF YOU'RE IN THAT LOOKOUT POSITION WHICH I WAS ON QUITE A LOT AS A SEAMAN IT'S ROUGH BECAUSE AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN ALL THE TIME BEING A DESTROYER YOU'RE ALMOST A SUBMARINE AT TIMES THE HOLL OF THE SEA COMES UP OVER YOU AND YOU GET KNOCKED BACK AGAINST THE SERCH LIGHT AND IT WAS VERY DAMP THAT IS VERY ROUGH UNCOMFORTABLE AND THIS IS WHAT DO YOU GET USED TO YOU USED TO WEAR UM A SPECIAL SUIT WHICH COVERED YOU COMPLETELY YOU WATERPOO SUIT WITH CAPE OP LINING A BUT EVEN EVEN THAT THE WATER GOT ALL THE WAY DOWN AND YOU GOT SOAKING BAT I REMEMBER COMING OFF WATCH ON ONE OCCASION LIKE THIS BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO CLIMB BACK DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE LADDERS OF THE SHIP BECAUSE THE DOORS THAYOU WOULD GO IN AND OUT IN PORT ARE OPEN WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA THOSE DOORS WILL BE CLOSED BECAUSE THE WATER COMES IN THOS SO YOU HAVE TO CLIMB DOWN E LADDERS DOWN THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP NOT NOT OUTSIDE IN THE SEA BUT CLIMB DOWN FROM THE TOP DECK TO THE BU DECK AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL THE WAVING IT HITS YOU YOU CAN GET WASHED AWAY SOYO HOLD ON VERY TIGHT WELL THIS WAS THE MIDDLE WATCH THATI CAN RECALL WHICH IS FROM TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING OR TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIHT TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BUT YOU'RE NOT ON WATCH ER LOOKOUT ALL THAT TIME OF THE FOUR HOUR WATCH YOU DO DEFINEINT JOBS HALF O ON LOOKOUT HALF HOUR PERHAPS ON THE RADAR SET HALF HOR NE HALF HOUR BEHIND A GUN WHERE THERE'S A GO YOU BECOME ART OF THEU GUN CREW SO IF YOU DID HAVE TO GO INTO ACTION YOU WOULD DO THE SHOOTING WHIL THE REAL GUN CREW IS CALLED UP TO TAKE OVER FROM THE WELL ON THIS OCCASION IT HAD BEEN VERY WET OUTSIDE I' GOT SOAK IN AND ETIRED I SAY MIDDLE WATCH PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK I'D COME DOWN I WENT DOWN TO MY MESS DECK WHICH AS IN THE FOCL ITW'S A ROUGH PART OF THE SHIP I HADN'T SLUNG MY HAMMOCK I'D SLEPT ON THE ER CUSHIONS THIS TIME Y I DIDN'T FANCY SLEEPING ON THE CUSHIONS ECAUSE THE SHIP WAS GOING TOO MUCH THIS WAY AND I KNEW I'D COME OFF THE CUSHIONS SO I GOT DOWN UNDER THE MESS TABLE THERE 'S ABOUT THAT MUCH WATER ON THE FLOOR THE DECK SORY NOT THE FLOOR ON THE DECK ABOUT THAT MUCH SO I GOT ALL MY CLOTHES ON THIS SUIT SU AS YOU CALLED IT AND EVERYTHING ND I'M LAYING DOWN OFF TO SLEEP STRAIGHT AWY H NEXT THING I KNOW A FOOT AD TOUCH ME AND I OPENED MY BLEARY EYES AND THERE WAS THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH AND THE LEADING SEAMAN OF THE MESS AND HE WAS SAYING TO ME I'M TOLD THIS IN THE MORNING BY THE LEADING HAND OF THE MESS HE SAID THE OFFICER SAID YOU COME ON SEAMAN YOU CAN'T SLEEP UNDER THERE IT'S TOO WET AND I SAID AND HE LOOKED AT THE LEADING HAND AND SAID WHAT DID HE SAY AND THE AN I DON'T KNOW I DON'T READ THAT LANGUAGE AND SO OH WELL WOU'D BETTER LET HIM SLEEP THERE AND HE LEFT ME THERE NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT IT NO OO E WELL YOU'RE LYING IN THAT MUCH WATER THE DECKS OF THE SHIPS WERE INSIDE YOU KNOW INSIDE YOUR MESS DECK THE WATER JUST IT'S MONE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE AND A LITTLE BIT WARMER INSIDE SO YOUE GOT ALL HUMIDITY L THE WATER RUNS DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE DECKS ANY TIME YOU'RE ON THE CAVALIER YOU HAVE A LOOK THE INSIDE OBECAUSE YOUR METAL WORK OF THE SHIP'S SIDE IT'S ONLY ABOUT N EIGHTH OF AN INCH NO THICKER THAN THAT AND EM SO THERE THEY ALWAY YOU GOT WATER MOST OF THE TIME ONON YOUR MESS DECKS WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA AND YOU'RE IN HARBOUR YOU NOT TOO BAD SO IT GETS A BIT UNCOMFORTABLETHERE WAS ANOTHER TIME WHEN WE WORKED WHITH HE QUEEN MARY AND WE HAD TO PICK HER UP TO BRING HER IN WE WENT OUT AND IT WAS IN ONE OF THE ROUGHEST STORMS WE HAD ABOUT THREE REALLY ROUGH STORMS IN THE PERIOD A WE WERE WORKING IN THE ATLANTIC AND WE HAD TO AT THIS TIME ITWO'D BE ABOUT MARCH NINETEEN FORTY FIVE WE HAD TO GO AND PICK UP THE QUEEN MARY NOW THE STORM HAD BEEN RAGING ALL THE WAY FROM AMERICA AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE THE BIG STORM THAT HAD COME ACROSS OUR WAY AND THE QUEEN MARY HAD BROUGHT IT WITH US SORT OF THING AND WE PICKED HER UP AND I THINK WE WERE A DAY OR MORE WAITING TO PICK HER UP BECAUSE EVEN SHE HAD BEEN HELD UP BY THE BAD STORMS WELL WE AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAS THE SISTER SHIP AT THAT TIME BUT WE GOT REALLY BENT UP WE LOST A MOTORBOAT WE LOST EMONE OF THE ERM WHALERS UM AND WE GOT REALLY KNOCKED ABOUT AND WHEN WE GOT N TOWARDS THE CLYDE THE THE QUEEN MARY KNOWING IT WAS IN THE AREA THERE WOULD BE U BOATS HAD TO RELY ON HER SPEED COULD BE A BIT SO AS AS WE UM GOT WITHIN HAILING DISTANCE I SUPPOSE SAY THE CLYDE AND THE QUEEN MARY DECIDED SHE COULDN'T SLOW DOWN TO KEEP UP WITH US CAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH FOR US WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER AND SO SHE JUST FLASHED A MESSAGE SERE YOURE IN THE CLYDE TAT A AND SHE KEPT UP HER SPEED AND GOT INTO THE CLYDE NOW SHE HAD THE WHOLE OF THE FRONT OF HER BRIDGE STOVED IN AND IT WAS A BIG SHIP WELL UP IN THE AIR THEY HAD A LOT OF CASUALTIES BECAUSE TER CARRYING ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND TROOPS AND THIS WAS NOW LATE AT NIGHT I THINK ABOUT EM A ELEVEN OCKA TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT BUT ANYWAY SHE GOT INTO THE CLYDE WITHOUT ANYTHING DAMAGE M FROM THE SEA WE LIMPED IN LATER ON NOW WHEN THE CLYDE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO MANCHOR AND WE COULDN'T GO FURTHER INTO GRENOCK TO GREENOCK BECAUSE AFTER THAT YOU GO THROUGH THE BOOM AND THE BOOM IS CLOSED AT NIGHT UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECSSARY TO OPEN THE BOOM WHICH PREVENTS OR HELPS TO PREVENT AN U BOATS GETTING AT THAT POINT SO AT THE OTHER SIDE WHERE WE AAD TO UM TIE UP TO A BOY WE HAVE TWO BOY JUMPERS TO TYE UP TO A BOY YOU HAVE TO STOP AND YOU HAVE TO LOWER YOUR WALA WITH A BOY JUMPER AND THE ROWERS IN IT TO TAKE YOU TO THE BOY WITH THE CHAIN TO CLIP IT TO THE BOY WELL IF I'VE GIVEN YOU A PICTURE OF HOW ROUGH THE STORM WAS IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT FIRST WHALA E WE UM AND LET DOWN ONTO THE WATER MANAGED TO GET DOWN SAFELY BUTT GOT WASHED AWAY WITH A CREW IN IT FURTHER DOWN THE CLDE NTHAT WAS AWAY FOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO LOWER ANOTHER WHALER ALL OF US WAS UP ON THE FOLE O KALL THE SEAMAN THAT COULD HELP WAS UP ON THE FORUSLE AND BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE YOUR ANCHOR YOU'RE JUST USING THE ANCHOR CHAIN WHICH GOES WITH A WIRE ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE ANCHOR CHAIN AND THE ER WHALER HAD TO TAKE THIS WIRE TO THE BY TO CLAMP IT ONTO THE BOY AND THEN THE BOYS PULLED BY THE ANCHOR CHAIN NEARER OF THE JHIP SO THEY CLIP IT ON SO ANYWAY THEY LOWERED THE SECOND WHALER THE BOY CHUMER MANAGED TO GET ONTO THE BOY AND IN DOING SO BROKE HIS WRIST AND ER IN THE END AFTER I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO CLIP UP TO THE BOY AND M THE ER CAPTAINS SAID TOP S ALL ROUND ER I HATED THE SMELL OF RUM ANNYWAY AND NEVER WOULD AV HAD MY TOP BECAUSE ITS HORRIBLE BUT ER L I HAD IT THAT NIGHT BECAUSE WE WERE FROZEN FROZEN STIFF AND WEN LANDUSE TO GET AWAY WITH IT BUT NOTHING WAS EVER SAID ABOUT THIS TYPE OF THING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH PEOPLE AT THE PORT KNEW THESE BIG SHIPS COME COME IN IT WAS NOT A THING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THE GERMANS ALSO KNEW THAT ER THEY WERE BRINGING ALL THESE LARGE NUMBERS BETWEEN ER TEN AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS THAT COULD CARRY AND M ANY OF THE U BOAT CAPTAINS I UNDERSTAND AND THIS IS NORMAL KNOWLEDGE WERE OFFERED A LARGE SUM OF MONEY THOUSANDS OF ERWHAT THEY A THON FOR OIS MAR DOMARK THOUSAND TO MARK AND THE HIGHEST OF THE OF HONORS TO AV KNOCKED DOWN ANYONE OF THESE MONSTERS BUT WE NEVER LOST ONE FORTUNATELY I'M HAPPY TO SAY BUT THE QUEEN MARY MWAS REALLY BATTERED VERY BADLY BATTERED HOW WE DIDN'T GET TURNED OO IVE GOT NO IDEA WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BIG SEAS WHAT SORT OF SIZE YOU TOOK WELL IF YOU ERMTHE SEAS ITSELF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL IT'S GENERALLY KNOWN THAT SOME OF THE WAVES WERE SIXTY FOOT HIGH NOW IF YOU THINK OF SIXTY T GOING UP THAT WAY WHEN YOU GO UP TO THE WAVE AND YOU COME DOWN TO THE TROUGH YOU'VE GOT AN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOOT AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN CUT THROUGH THOSE WAVES AND THE BIG SHIPS OR THE SMALL SHIPS YOU ACTUALLY GO UP ON THAT WAE AND THEN YOU FEEL IT AT YOU GOME DOWN WITH A CRUNCH LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU UP O THE NEXT ONE AND ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CORKSCREWING OU KNOW YOU'RE NOT STILL AND YOU GET USED TO THIS AFTER ABOT THE FIRST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE YOU GOT RUISE ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE YOU GO THROUGH UM NORMAL EM CORRIC FLATS THEY'RE CALLED ON A DESTROYER THE NORMAL CORRIDOR ON A FLO ON A AND DESTROYER WHICH IS ABOUT THAT WIDE WELL WHEN YOU FIRST GO ABOARD ONE LIKE THAT AND IT WAS FAIRLY CALM WHEN YOU SET OUT OR SCAPA FROM GREENOCK BUT AS YOU WALK ALONG THE DECK COMES UP TO MEET YOU IT GOES UP AND YOU HIT YOUR FEET AS YOU GO DOWN ON THE DECK BUTBEFORE YOU KNOW IT THAT DECK HAD GONE AWAY AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN AND THIS HITS YOU FROM THE TOP AND THEN WHILE THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING THIS THIS BOLKET HITS YOU AND ACTUALLYOU KNOW THAT BULKHET HITS YOU SO IN TIME YOU LEARN TO WALK LIKE A SAILOR AND AF THE SHIP GOES DOWN YOU GO DOWN WITH IT AND COME UP WITH IT AND THAT'S HYOU'LL FIND SAILORS AND WHEN YOU GET ASHORE THEY WORK WITH A ROLL WALK WITH A ROLL THAT IS JUST THAT 'R STILL WALKING ON THE SHIP SO AFTER THE END OF THE WAR RIGT E DAY RIGHT YOU'RE NOT FINISHED YEAH AN VDAY ITSELF WE WERE A THAT'S THE NINTH OF MAY WE WERE BRINGING IN THE ILDE FRANCE AND WE GO NOTICE THAT THE PEACE M HAD BEEN DECLARED FOR THE NEXT DAY M EN WE GOMING INTO GINTO GREENOCK SO WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN THE LAST OF THE ONE SHIP CONVOYS BEFORE THE WAR ENDED SO WE ARRIVED IN GREENOCK I BELIEVE IT ITE OF A WEDNESDAY OR SUNDAY EM HALF THE SHIPS COMPANY WAS ALLOWED LEAVE WHICH WASN'T ME ON FR OR WASN'T ONE OF THE SHIPS COMPANY BUT THEY WENT ASHORE TO GREENOCK A HAD G TRM NO TIME SO THEN WE STILL CARRIED ON WITH SOME OF THESE CONVOYS AFTER THERE BECAUSE ERM THERE WAS QUITE A FEW OF THE U BOATS THAT APPARENTLY MISSING A ALOT OF THEM ONE OR TWO WENT TO BRAZIL OR WHATEVER SO THERE WAS SSTILL A CHANCE THA IF THERE WAS A O U BOAT AROUND THEY COULD HAVE KNOCKED DOWN SOME OF THE ERM MONSTERS WE WERE STILL BRINGING BACK IN BUT WE HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL BUT TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT ANYWAY WE WERE THEN DESTINED TO GO ACROSS TO ERM THE END TRY TO END THE JAPANESE WAR SO TWO BY TWO OUR FLOTILLA WENT IN FOR REFITS W WE WENT IN FOR REFIT LATE IN MAY RM JUNE BECAUSE WE WERE GOING OUT THERE ANYWAY BUT FORTUNATELY WHILE I WAS ON EM LEAVE TO GO OUT THERE THE SHIP WAS DOWN AT DEVONPORT BEING REFITTED THE WAR ENDED SO I STILL GOT A TELEGRAM TO SAY DAYS LEAVE EXTRA DAY LEAVE EXTRA WHEN WE CAME BACK TO THE SHIP WE STILL HAD TO GO OUT THERE BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING TO CLEAR UP AFTER THE WAR WELL EM THE WHOLE OF OUR FLOTILLA WERE OUT TTHEN WE WERE THE LAST TWO SO AS WE WENT OUT GIBRALTAR MALTA AID AN AD PLANGES LIKE THAT WE THOUGHT WE WAS TIN FOR A LOVELY SUMMER CRUISE BUT THEN WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE NO WHEN WE GOT TO TRNKMALE THAT WAS OUR NAVAL BASE WE BASED A TRINKMALE AND WERE ALSO BASED AT SINGAPORE EL WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE THIS WAS JUST ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THE WAR AND MWE WERE CARRYING OUT AN EXERCISE WITH ERHMS SUSSEX AND ANOTHER SHIP AND MTHE CAPTAIN THE FILA THE FLOTILLA LEADER IT WAS ON HMS CAESAR AND OURSELVES IN CAVALIER WERE ORDERED TO GO WITH THE SUSSEX TO M A PROBLEM SO WE IMMEDIATELY WENT AT FULL SPEED WE WERE SENT TO TO JAVA WE STOPPED ON E A COUPLE OF TROOP SHIPS ON THE WAY CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT BUT WE TOOK ON BOARD OUR FULL DECK WAS COVERED WITH INDIAN TROOPS ARMED INDIAN TROOPS AND THE CAVALIER WAS THE SAME AND THE CAESAR WAS ALSO AND THE SUSSEX ANCHORED OUTSIDE SIRABAY BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GET IN WE COULD HARDLY GET IN BECAUSE THERE WAS A SUNKEN ER JAPANESE CRUISER IN THERE IN THE WAY SO CAESAR WENT IN FIRST BECAUSE SHE WAS A FLOTILALEDER FULL OF TROOPS WE WENT IN SECOND AS WE WERE SECOND AND THEN THE CAVALIER AFTERARDS IS WE WENT IN IT WAS DAYLIGHT WE HAD ALL HIS TROOPS ON BOARD SO IF WEDY HAD ANY TROUBLE WE COULDN'T HAVE USED OUR GUNS BECAUSE OF TUTH LUCKILY WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE FROM THE SHORE BUT AS WE CAME INTO SURABAA I WAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE AND THERE WAS BODIES DOZENS OF THEM IN WHITE NAVAL UNIFORMS I THINK THEY WERE QIPROBABLY DUTCH I DON'T THINK THEY WAS OURS BUT WEWERE SLOWLY MOVING AVOIDING THIS WRECKAGE AND AVOIDING THE BODIES AND M YOU GOT TO THE STAGE NOW WHEN WE IN E WAR BODIES IN THE WATER MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU OU ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT THEY WERE BODIES AND DEAD YOU KNOW ANDSO ANYWAY YOU MOVED IN WE ANCHORED IN THE DOCK THERE AND UM ONE BY ONE THE CRUISER DISGORGED HER TROOPS FIRST AND WE CAME IN NEXT SO THE THREE OF US ALL OUR TROOPS WENT ASHORE THE DOCKS HAD BEEN ALREADY TAKEN OVER BY UM RTHE UK ARMY I THINK HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN AHEAD AND M IT WAS THE INDON INDONESIAN REBELS THAT FIGHTING THEYAD ALREADY KILLED MBRIGADEER MALABY THAT WAS THE ARMY M BOSH M AND THESE TROOPS WENT ASHORE AND WE STAYED THERE READY FOR M A LOT OF SURVIVORS M OF THE DUTCH PEOPLE THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS FROM A CAMP RIGHT THE OTHER SIDE OF M SURVEYOR AND THERE WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT UNDER AN ESCORT OFOR ANOTHER TROOCE SHE BRIGADED MALAVIAD BEEN KILLED UNDER A TROOCE NOW THIS SUPPOSED TOAVE BEEN ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DUTCH PEOPLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN MOSTLY IN A CAMP THE OTHER SIDE THEYE WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS BY ANOTHER TROOCE UM ARMY TRUCKS MAND GUARDED BY INDIAN TROOPS YO WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS TO US AND WERE GOING TO HAVE THEM ON BOARD AND WE W TO TAKE THEM OUT TO THE TROOPERS WHICH COULDN'T GET INTO THE HARBOUR WELL WE WERE THEN TOLD WHILE WE WE WAITING FOR THESE PEOPLE TO COME ACROSS WE WERE TO GO OUT INTOR THE WATER BECAUSE WE MIGHT BE USED WHICH WAS WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AS IT HAPPENED
