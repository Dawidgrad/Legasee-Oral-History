CAME OUT AGAIN TO REPLACE THE MINES THEY THOUGHT WE'D PICKED UP AND THE LOST FOUR OF THEIR OWN BOATS ON THEIR OWN MINES AND I DON'T THINK THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY SPORTY THAT DOCUMENT IT COMMENTED SOMEWHERE IN THE ADMIRALTY ARCHIVES ER THEY THINK OIT I DID HE COULD HAVE GOT INTO A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR THAT WHAT WAS YOUR WORT WHAT WOULD YOU DO O WHEN WE WENT OUT I WAS A DUE TO REPORT WITH

UP ALTHOUGH OFFICIALLY WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT ANDER FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS BEFORE DE THEY ON APLETYS TRUCKES BRIDGE STARTED NIGHT SWEEPING AS AN ALL TURNATIVE TO THE DAY SHIFT SO THE GERMANS WOULD GET USED TO THE IDEA AS POPPING ALONG THE COAST DURING THE HOURS OF DOUBTLESS THEY WOULD SE ANTHY OF IT SO THE EARLY MORNING OF DE DEY WE WENT OUT AT MIDNIGHT AND WE WERE SWEEPING RIGHT UP TO THE LINE WHERE THE BATTLESHIPS WERE WAITING TO BOMBARD THE COAST WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE STATIONED AND WE SWEPT THAT MOST CAREFULLY AND THEN WE AS THEY STARTED COMING ABOUT OF THE DARKNESS FROM TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WAITING AND WE RETIRED BEHIND THEM THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE FOR US TO DO WE GOT SENT BACK HERE TO THE ILE OF SHEVY WHEN THE TROOPS WENT ASHORE WE WERE A BIT ANNOY CAUSE WE WEREN'T DOIN ANYTHING AND THEN AN ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE DAYS LATER AS GIBVER GOT THE ORDERS TO AND BUTROLLD THE DUTCH COAST ON THE SHET AND PICK UP ALL THE MINDS WHICH THE GERMANS TAD SEWN LIBERALLY ROUND ALLE THE COAST THERE SO THAT KEPT AS BUSY FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS AND A WE WERE STATIONED AT A LITTLE TOWN CALLED TERNUSEN A VERY SMALL PORT BUT THERE WAS AND ALONG JETTY SO WE COULD MORE ALONGSIDE THERE AND IN THE EVENINGS LATE AFTERNOON YOU GOT SHORE LEAVED UNTIL YOU WERE GOING OFF AGAIN NEXT MORNING AND ID NEVER FORGOTTEN THE THINGS WE SAW WE WENT ASHORE THE GERMANS HADE GOT OUT IN A HURRY AND THAT THEIR SIGNS WERE EVERYWHERE ON THAT HOTEL LOUNGED THAT WER BEEN AN OFFICERS MISS AND THE SIGNS WERE STIL UP AND THEY BLEW SOME O THE BRIDGES OVER THE CANALS AS THEY LEFT AND THE DUTCH FLOODED SOME OF THE DICE TO STOP THEIR HEAVY TRAFFIC GETTIN AWAY AND I REMEMBER ONCE WE WENT ASHORE WE ALL CARRYED THE NABY RAINCOAT DRAPED OVER YOUR ARM FOLDED IN A CERTAIN WAY AND THE OBSER WATCH KNEW VERY WELL WE HAD THINGS IN THE POCKETS CIGARETTES PACKET OF BISCUITS A TILLO GEM OR WHATEVER WHICH WES NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN OFF THE SHIP AND WE WERE GIVING IT TO THE DUTCH CIVILIONS CAUSE THEY WERE AS STARVED AS HELL AND LOOKED VERY ILL AND ON THIS OCCASION WE GOT ASHORE AND I I SAW A VERY THIN AG LOOKING WOMAN COMING UP THE STREET PUSHING ER ABOUT A PRAM AND SHE GOT TWO LITTLE KIDS IN THERE ABOUT THREE OR A BIT LESS I SUPOSE AND ONE BLANKET COVER THEM AND I DOF MAHAD AGOOD DAY AND SHE GAVE ME A SMILE SHE COULDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH AND I COULDN'T SPEAK DUTCH BUT I TOOK OUT WHAT I HAD AND I PUT IT IN HER PRAM YOU SHU SEEN THE LOOK ON HER FACE SHE MASTL THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS COME TWICE WUS WHAT THEY DIDN'T EAT THEN CAD ALWAYS TRADE FOR SOMETHING ELSE SO AD GONE BACK WITH MORE BUT EM IT WASN'T TO BE AFTER WE GOT RID OF MOST OF THE MINES OFF THE DUTCH COAST WE HAD A AN A WEEK'S LEAVE YOU WELL OSE WE WON'T COMING BACK HERE FOR IT TET WOULD BE ON THE DUTCH COAST AND A IRAS ANOTHER FELLOW WE GOT ON TO THE MAIN ROAD WHICH WAS THE BRUSSELS ROAD LEADING T INTO A BELGIUM AND THUMB LIPS FROM ARMY LOWYS WHICH ARE ALWAYS GOING UP AND DOWN AND WE GOT INTO N ABOUT THREE THREE HOURS NO A BIT LESS INTO BRUGE WHICH IS ONE THATT WAS ONE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SID THAT I'VE SEEN GOT A TWO CATHEDRALS AND ORPERA HOUSE AN THE TOWN HALL ROUND THE FOUR SIDES OF THE MAIN SQUARE AND E ONE OF THE HOTELS HAD BEEN TAKEN OVER AS THE NAPPY FOR THE TROOPS BED BREAKFAST SO WE STAYED THERE AND E WE ENJOYED OURSELVES THEN WHEN WE CAME BACK WE GOT ORDER BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AND WERE STILL LOOKING FOR MINDS WHICH MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED DETECTION GOING UP AND DOWN BUT IRE WASN'T A MUCH URGENCY ANY ANY MORE AND AN I DID PUT IN APPLICATION TO SIT FOR LEADING STEWARD BUT BEFORE A THAT COULD TAKE PLACE MY DISCHARGED PAPERS CAME THROUGH AND THAT WAS IN THE A EARLY EARLY NINETEEN SIX FORTY NINETEEN FORTY SIX NINETY NINETY FORTY SIX YEARS AFTER THE WAR YEAR BUT UNLIKE THE ARMY OR THE AMPLESE WE GOT PLENTY OF NOTICE WHEN IT WAS COMING I KNOW PEOPLE IN THE APLES AND THEY WBERE GIVEN THREE DAYS NOTICE THAT THEY WERE OUT BUT IN THE NABY WE HAD TIME YOU TOLD YOU GOT TO BE DEMOBBED IN THREE MONTHS WERE THEY GIVE YOU TIME TO START LOOKING ROUND FOR A CIVILIAN JOB OR SOME WHERE TO LIVE IF YOU'RE MARRIED WITH KIDS SO I THINK WE HAD A BETTER DEAL CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS MIND SWEEPING JUST EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WERE DOING AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MINDS WELL THATU LOOK LIKE YARD FROM THE MAIN MAST STRETCHED OUT EITHER SIDE ABOUT FIFTY FEET AND FROM THESE AR DEPENDING VERY SHARP CUTTING WIRES WITH WEIGHTS ON THE END ADAS YOU GO THO THE WATER THE IDEA IS TO YOUR CUTTING WIRES TO CATCH THE MORING WIRE FOR A MINE UNCUT IT THE MIND COMES TO THE SERVICE AND YOU DISPOSE OF IT HOW MANY MINES WHULD YOU FIND ON A AN AVERAGE DAY ON EVERYDAY AND POSSIBLY A DOZEN POSSILY ONLY TWO IT VARIED AND THE DISPOSAL WOULD BE A SHOTADIL THAT'S WHAT IT STARTA BE YES THEN THE GERMAN'S ADVENTURES HERE AND A COASTIC MIND WHICH AM WASN'T MORE I WAS JUST DROPPED IN THE CHANNEL HOPEFULLY IN THE PATH OF ONCOMING SHIPS AND IT EMITTED A MAGNETIC FIELD FROM AN BATTERIES THAT WERE INSIDE AND EVERY SHIP AS IT GOES ALSO MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD AND WHEN THE TWO COLLIDE THE MIND GOES UP SO WE HAD TO HAVE A WAS CALLED DEGALSING EQUIPMENT A SPECIAL COIL FITTED RIGHT ROUND THE SHIP AND A CURRENDIST PATH THROUGH THAT ANTE CLOCKWISE AND THAT NULLIFIES THE EFFECT OF THE ELECTRONIC FIELD AND YOU CUL GO OVER MINES AND YOU BEAR RIGHT DID YOU FIND NOS NOINES WE FOUND HIM YES SOMETIMES THE JOURNANS GOT CRAFT AND THEY DROPPED SOME OF THESE MINES AT NIGHT FROM LOW FLYING PLAINS AND WE GOT BACK I WASN'T THAT I WAS ON THE COUP OF DAY'S LEAVE AND I WENT HOME TO MADSTONE BUT AN I WAS TOLD AS ASCORDEN CAME BACK FROM PATROL AND THE LAST AT THE SHIP IN SLID INTO ITS PLACE ON THE JETTY AND PROMPTLY BLEW UP THERE WAS A MINE UNDERNEATH BEING DROPPED BY A PLAN AND THE SKIBBER OF THIS LAST BOAT AS HE WAS ONLY SIX FEET FROM THE JETTY EGOLEGED TE GALS THE EQUIPMENT SWITCHED OFF ASKE ING THERE WAS TWO SURVIVORS BUT WHO THEY WERE I DON'T KNOW BUT HOW WOULD YOU FIND I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD FIND A MIND THAT WAS HAT FLOATING IN THE WATER YOU CUT IT AND IT FLOATS NSO HOW DID YOU FIND THESE MAGNETIC MINDS WITH AY ON THE BOTTOM OR THEEON ON THE BOTTOM YES HOW WOULD YOU FIND THAT WERE WITH A LAS YOUR SOLAR DEVICE IT PICKS UP THE THE RADIATIONS FROM THE MIND AND YOU COULD SEE EXACTLY WHERE IT IS THEYD DROP A DIF CHARGE ON IT YOU SET THE DEAT CHARGE FOR TWENTY FEET OR THIRTY WHATEVER IT IS AND JUST SOME POT THEM OVERS ASIDE ON THE WY GUN IN HOLLAND WHEN YOU GOT TO HOLLAND YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMORIES OF JUST THE DEVASTATION WHEN THE GERMANS GOT OUT NARRY THEY TOOK EVERYONE WIT AM A LIVE ALL DEAD AND BLEW A COUPLE OF BRIDGES AND THEN RETREATED TOWARD BELDAM DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE WINNING THE WAR AT THAT STAGE YES THE GREAT DAY HAD COME THE INVASION HAD STARTED AND WE WERE PUSHING IN THEND FROM THE BEECHES WE HADN'T BEEN SHUBD BAG OFF AGAIN AND THEY WERE STARTING TO TO DE BITE WHEN YOU WERE PULLED OUT OF DEDAY DID YOU WE WE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WAS GOING ON AN DEDE AFTER THE BATTLE SHIP TO THE RIDE YOU COME BACK TO BATE YOU KNOW WE WER ROUND LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR THE BUT THE GUNS GOING ON THETHERE WHEN THE REMAINED BROADSIDE STARDEE YEAS I THINK IT WAS EM QUARTER TO SIX AND EIGHT MILES OF SHIPS ALL OPENED UP AT THE SAME TIME AND WE ALREADY GOT INFORMATION FROM THE UNDERGROUND OF RESISTANCE WORKERS WHERE THE GERMAN STRONG POINTS WERE ALL ALONG THE CLIFF TOPS HEAVY GUN IN PLACEMENTS BUNKERS FOR TROOPS AND SO ON AND THEY GOT CONTINUOUS PLASTERING AND A THEY HADN'T QUITE FINISHED IT WAS A A TO OUR BOMBARBAD AND BOUT A HALF AN OUTWET STOPPED THTHE BOATS WERE GOING ASHORE WITH THE TROOPS DID YOU HEAR WE WERE ON THE MAN PEVERS BEHIND AND WE HEARD IT ALL RIGHT IT WAS SUCH A DEAPENING CRUCENDO OF NOISE THERE'S NOT NOTHING LIKE IT E WOUN'T EVEN NEAR IT NO YET WHAT DO YOU LIVE E EDAY OH THAT WAS AGAIN MARBELLOUS I WAS AWAITING DE MOB AND OF COURSE WE GOT RATHER MORE LAVE ONE PIECE WAS DECLARED AND I'D GOT AN I THINK IT WAS A POR DAY PASS TO GO HOME TO MADSTONE AND IT CAME UP ON THE THE TRAIND O VICTORIA ANDE THE PLACE WAS JUST ONE SEETHE MASS OF PEOPLE EVERY COLOUR EVERY UNIFORM AYBE THING YOU WOULD THINK OF EVERYONE WAS
