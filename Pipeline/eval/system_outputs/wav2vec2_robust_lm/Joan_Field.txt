COURSE I DID NOT WANT TO DO I HAD AN EYE TEST AND THEY DECIDED I GOT PERFECT EYESIGHT THEN AND SO I WAS TOLD I WAS GOING TO BE A SIGNAL AND DIDN'T MEAN MUCH TO ME BUT I DIDN'T MIND WHAT IT WAS AND I WAS CALLED UP JUST A MONTH BEFORE CHRISTMAS TO H M S CABLE WHICH IS UP IN WARRINGTON WAS JUST TRYING TO THINK NINETY I THINK IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE BEGINNING IN MIDDLE OF NINETEEN FORTY ONE AND I THOUGHT THIS IS MARVELLOUS ALL THE OFFICERS AT CHRISTMAS WERE WAITING ON A THOUGH IT IS A LOVELY IDEA THIS IS BECAUSE I WAS SHORT LIVED IT WAS VERY TOUGH AT CABLE AND YOU WERE GIVEN TWO WEEKS PROBE WHAT THEY CALL PROBATION AND YOU WERE GIVEN ALL THE DIRTY JOBS TO DO AN OVAL SCRUBBING THE FLOORS CLEAN ON THE LOOSE IT WAS MAKE ALL BREAK TIME REALLY SQUADRILLI UNTIL SQUADRO OH HATED SQUADREL BUT I GOT TO LOVE IT ACTUALLY AFTER THAT BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY AM AND AT THE END OF THE FORTNIGHT AM WE WERE ACCEPTED SOME OF THEM WENT HOME SOME OF THEM WENT A WALL IF YOU WENT A WALL AND YOU JUST WENT INTO MUNITIONS OR WHATEVER BUT IF YOU DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT PERHAPS THE WEF WOULD HAVE HAD YOU WE WERE FIRST CHOICE IN THOSE DAYS EVERYBODY WANTED TO GO IN THE RUNS AND SO I STARTED MY VISUAL SIGNALLING AND CODING I DID SOME CODING AS WELL BUT BASICALLY VISUAL SIGNALLING AND AM THE COURSE LASTED I THINK FOR SIX MONTHS AS HE WAS ABOUT SIX MONTHS FOR ME NOW FOUR MONTHS FOUR MONTHS I THINK

FATHER AND MY GRANDFATHER ALL SERVED IN THE ARMY AM I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS I I LOVE TO SEE AM MAYBE THE UNIFORM IS A BIG YOU I DO I WROTE DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE IN THE WRENS IT WAS JUST SOMETHING I THINK STEPHANE HAD THE SAME WHEN YOU READ HER BOOK AM IT'S AN ATTRACTION TO IT AM I SUPPOSE IN A WAY IT'S A SORT OF GLAMOUR OF THE REN NOW YOU MENTION CAMILA AND I MENTION YOU KNOW VEG VISIT SHIP VISUALIZATION AND CODING BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT WHAT YOU WERE LEARNING AND HOW YOU LEARNED VISUALIZATION AND WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THE PROCESS WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU GOT TO LEARN THE MORSE CODE AND YOU KNOW EVEN AT SEVENTEEN THAT'S A BIT TRICKY BUT STILL YOU LEARN THE MORSE CODE AM AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY DRUMMED INTO THE MORSE CODE AM IS IT PURELY REPETITION YES REALLY AND TRULY AND YOU LEARN GIMMICKS TO LEARN IT YOU KNOW OF AND YOU DID DID A DAD IT YOU KNOW THE FACE YOU KNOW YOU LEARN ALL THESE SORT OF GIMMICKY THINGS TO REMIND YOU M IS TOUGH WE WERE ALL PUT INTO CLASSES AND THE VISUAL SIGNALS CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH A V AND MY CLASS WAS VERITY AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT STEPHEN'S CLASSES WHICH HE JUST MENTION IN THE BOOK THE WILES TELEGRAPHERS CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH DOUBLE LIKE WAR SPITE AND THE CODING CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH A S I MEAN AND EACH COURT COURSE WAS A DIFFERENT LENGTHS AND WE LEARNED MORSE CODE SEMAPHORE AM A SIGNAL WITH FLAGS YOU KNOW LIKE THE OLD NELSON SIGNAL WHICH KEPT CHANGING LEARNING THE PHONETIC ALPHABET WHICH HALF WAY THROUGH OUR COURSE CHANGED SO THAT THE AMERICANS COULD UNDERSTAND IT WHICH ANNOYED US WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO CHANGE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS ANYWAY SO THE PHONETIC ALPHABET AM EVERY CLASS WAS MANNED BY AN X SERVING MAN USUALLY A CHIEF WHO'D NEVER DEALT WITH WOMEN BEFORE AND SOME OF THEM WERE A BIT TOUGH A BIT TOUGH BUT WE NEEDED IT BECAUSE WE WERE COMPLETELY RAW TO IT ALL WE HAD ON WE WERE TAUGHT NAVAL DISCIPLINE AND DIFFERENT TIME WATCHES YOU KNOW HOW THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CLOCK WHICH RECOURSE WE HADN'T STARTED TO USE THEM THE BASICS REALLY BASIC AND I FOUND IT QUITE ENJOYABLE IT WAS JUST LIKE BEING AT SCHOOL REALLY AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR RENNEY WHERE WERE ABLE AM PRETTY SPARTAN BUT NOT TOO BAD IT WAS AN OLD NISSEN HUTS I THINK THEY'VE BEEN USED BY THEM I THINK MENTION STEPNEY MENTIONS IT IN A BOOK I THINK THEY'D BEEN USED BY THE POST OFFICE BUT WE'RE ALL OLD NISSEN HUTS ON THIS BIG BIG SIGHT AT NEWTON FOR JUST OUTSIDE WARRINGTON AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOW BEING DEVELOPED INTO A BIG HOUSING DIET BUT IT WAS A VERY LARGE CAMP AM MOSTLY THE REGNERY BUT THERE WERE ALSO THE MEN ON BOARD AS WELL THEY WERE LEARNING AM I THINK THEY WERE DOING W T BUT WE WERE OBVIOUSLY BEING TRAINED TO TAKE OVER SOME OF THE SIGNAL STATIONS FROM THE MEN TO RELEASE THEM AND WHICH WE LEARNED AFTERWARDS OBLOUSLY SO I GOT MY DRAFT UP TO OPEN WHEN YOU GET A DRAFT AND YOU KNOW HOW IS YOUR COMMUNICATION YOUR PARENTS AND THIS DRAUGHT YOU SAY O BAM ONLY WHERE'S THAT HOW DID YOU GET THERE WHAT DID YOUR PARENTS THINK WELL A BIT STAGGERED BY MY MY MOTHER MY FATHER YES MY FATHER TOOK ME UP TO EUSTON STATION I GOT THIS DRAUGHT JUST A THING A REPORT TO THE AM I SUPPOSE IT WAS A SORT OF PATROL POLICE UP IN EUSTON THEN I WAS SENT ON TO A WHEN I GO FROM KINGS CROP NOW I SENT TO WENT TO KING'S CROSS AND HAD TO GO TO EUSTON AM ALL THIS MILITARY STUFF WENT ALL IN CAVES ONLY ALLOWED TO TAKE A SUITCASE OF CLOTHES ONE ONE OUTFIT OF CIVIL CLOTHES AND THEN YOU KNOW THE USUAL PAJAMAS ALWAYS PAJAMAS AM SLIPPER YOU KNOW THE USUAL SORT OF THING IF YOU WERE GOING INTO HOSPITAL ROSE BUT ONLY ONE SET OF CIVIC CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND TO REPORT TO THIS PLACE IN IN ONE OF THE STATIONS I THINK IT WAS KING'S CROSS AND THEY TOOK ME UNDER THEIR WING AND SORTED ME OUT AND GOT ME ON TO THE TRAIN MY FATHER SAW ME OFF AND THAT WAS REALLY ALL THAT HAPPENED I ENDED UP I THOUGHT WHEREVER AM I GOING YOU KNOW YOU GO MILES AND MILES CAUSE ALL THE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW SAILORS ON GOING UP TO DIFFERENT GOING BACK ON LEAVE AND THEY WERE ALL KIND TO ME THEY ALL REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THE TRAIN WAS CROWDED AND I CAN REMEMBER WE COULDN'T SIT DOWN ANYWHERE AND ONE OF THE SAILORS PUT ME UP ON TO THE TOP OF THE RACK AT THE TOP SO I COULD HAVE A SLEEP I CAN ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT AND WE GOT TO CARLISLE THERE WAS AN AIR RAID WARNING AM AND WE HAD TO STAY IN CARLYLE SIDING FOR ABOUT AN HOUR WHICH MEANT THAT I HAD MISSED MY TRAIN FROM CARLYLE TO A STERLING WHERE I HAD TO CHANGE AGAIN SO THAT WAS ANOTHER PROBLEM AM GOD SHE GOT TO STERLING AND COURSE THE TRAIN TO OBAN HAD GONE SO I WAS STRANDED AND THE U S PUT ME UP IN A HOTEL HOSTEL FOR THE NIGHT AND I WENT DOWN TO OBAN REPORTED TO OBAN TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE AT OBAN AND WAS TOLD I WAS GOING TO PEER SIGNAL STATION IN THE MORNING I GO GOING TO THE PIER SIGNAL STATION IN THE MEANTIME OF COURSE I'D BEEN KITTED UP A CABLE WE WERE KITTED UP AM BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BELL BOTTOMS NOW THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR A VIS RAN BECAUSE IT'S SO COLD SO I WAS ISSUED WITH BELL BOTTOMS AND NEXT DAY WENT ON DUTY HAVEN'T YOU KNOW AND I THOUGHT THIS IS CRAZY ALL THIS SORT OF BUSINESS A CABLE ALL THE STRICT DISCIPLINE AND NAVAL DISCIPLINE NOBODY SEEMED TO BE BOTHERED IT I DON'T THINK YOU THINK THAT THEY REALIZED THERE WAS A WAR ON EXCEPT FOR THE COURSE THE CONVOY IS COMING IN AND I LIKED LIKED IT I LIKE SCOTLAND STEPNEY DIDN'T LIKE IT YOU'LL READ IN HER BOOK IF YOU EVER READ IT A SHE JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO MIX IN VERY WELL WITH SCOTTISH PEOPLE BUT I HAD GOT A SCOTTISH GRANDFATHER PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT SO I DID SORT OF ACCEPT IT MORE AND I REALIZED THAT THOUGH THEY ARE A BIT INSULAR AND THAT THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO BE OFF PUTTING BUT THEY WERE BECAUSE THEY IT IS AN INSULAR LAND UP IN THE HIGHLANDS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THE HIGHLANDS VERY WELL AND THERE ARE A THING UNTO THEMSELVES OKAY WELL SO JUST DO ME A FAVOUR THAN JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ABOUT WHAT THE BASE WAS LIT WHAT WHILE YOUR SURROUNDINGS LIKE WAYS SLEPT AND PINES LIT IT OPEN AND OPEN YET AND THEY WOULD WOULD TALK ABOUT THE WORK YES WHILE I OPENED FIRST OF ALL I WAS STATIONED IN WHAT WAS CALLED THE STATION HOTEL AND THE SIGNAL STATION ON THE PIER WAS ONLY A SHORT WALK AWAY AND I MET UP WITH A GIRL WHO WAS GOING TO WORK WITH ME SHE'D BEEN THERE ABOUT A WEEK WE HADN'T YET STARTED REALLY GETTING THE CONVOYS IN SO WE WERE TOLD WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THAT THE CONVOYS WOULD COME IN AND THEY'D BE IN THE BAY AND WE HAD TO MANY MAN THE SHIP ME ALL THE TIME AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO ON ANY BOATS THAT'S ANOTHER THE STORY WE HAD TO MOUNT MONITOR EVERYTHING COMING IN AND OUT WE ALSO HAD TO LOOK AFTER FUNNILY ENOUGH THE AM ARE F HAD THEIR SUNDERLANDS AND CATALINAS UP THERE AND THEY HAD A CALL SIGN WHICH CHANGED EVERY HOUR AND HALF OF THEM COULD NEVER EVER READ IT SO WE USED TO HAVE TO READ THEIR COST SIGNAL FOR THEM TO SEND THEIR PATROL BOAT OUT BUT THAT WAS UNBEKNOWN TO A BASE WHO NEVER HAD A CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON IT WAS A CRAZY SET UP REALLY AND SUBMARINES ON PATROL DUTY USED TO COME IN ALONGSIDE THE PEER WE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THEM THEIR SIGNALS AND THEY WOULD EMIT OUT ON PATROL THAT WAS MOSTLY WHAT WE WERE DOING AT THE PIER SIGNAL STATION AM BUT THIS WASN'T ADEQUATE ENOUGH AND GANAVAN SIGNAL STATION WHICH WAS RIGHT ROUND THE CORNER FROM WHERE WE WERE WAS STILL MANNED BY THE MEN AND THEY ALSO HAD A NEW AZTEC CENTER OPENING UP JUST BELOW I WISH BE VERY DARK ANNOUNCED DICK AND THEY LET US TO DONE BY THE MEN AND THE MEN WERE GOING FROM GADNAVAN AND THEY WERE GOING OVER TO LISMORE THE RENTS WEREN'T ALLOWED OUT THERE BECAUSE IT WAS IT WAS COMPLETELY ALONE OUT THERE NO NO THERE WAS NO INHABITATION EXCEPT A FEW FOR FEW SHEEP FARMERS SO THE RENTS WEREN'T ALLOWED OUT IN LISMORE AND THAT'S WHERE THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN UNBEKNOWN TO ANYBODY AND SO THE GANAVAN SIGNAL STATION WAS GOING TO OPEN UP AND WE WERE GOING TO GO THERE WHICH MEANT VERY GREAT DIFFICULTY BECAUSE FROM THE STATION HOTEL TO GANAVON IT WAS ABOUT COUPLE THREE MILES TWO OR THREE MILES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT'S NO JOKE AND SO EVENTUALLY I WAS THERE FOR ABOUT PER SIGNAL STATION FOR A BOUT I WOULD SAY ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE CANAVAN WAS OPEN GANAVAN SIGNAL STATION WAS THEN OPENED UP FOR THE WRENS AND WE TOOK OVER FROM THE MEN MEN WE HAD AN INTAKE THEN OF MORE VS REN SO THERE WERE NOW SIX OF US INSTEAD OF FOUR AND WE TOOK OVER GANEVAN FROM THE MEN VERY VERY SPARTAN WHEN WE WERE AT THE PIER SIGNAL STATION WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE MEALS WITH IN THE MESS PROPER MEALS ONE MORE NIGHT WATCH I WOULD DO US UP NICE SANDWICHES WHEN WE MOVED FROM PIER SIGNAL STATION TO THE GANEVAN SIGNAL STATION WE WERE STATIONED AT A PLACE CALLED ROSEY LODGE WHICH WAS VERY TOUGH GOING AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE WATCH KEEPERS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T HANDLE US NEARLY ALL NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THE RENNERY WAS WRITERS OR W T OPERATORS WHO WORKED PROPER WATCH OUR THEY WERE NINE TO FIVE NOR AS WE HAD NOW WE HAD TO DO IT WATCHKEEPING OURS THE SAME AS THE NAVY SO IF YOU WERE LUCKY YOU GET A HOT DINNER IF YOU DIDN'T YOU JUST HAD A SARDINE SANDWICH SO THE FOOD WAS PRETTY SPARSE IF YOU READ IN THE BOOK PEOPLE MY FRIENDS WHO READ THE BOOK SAY WHY DID YOU STAND IT BUT I SAID BUT THERE WAS A WAR AND WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY DIFFERENT WE HAD TO GO DO IT WITH OUR JOB THE MEN IT WAS IT WAS A VERY VERY SPARSE SIGNAL STATION AM SHALL WE WANT ME TO DESCRIBE IT TO HIS VEST THE SIGNAL STATION ITSELF WAS RIGHT ON THE TOP OF CANAVAN ON JUST BY DONAL DENALI HOUSE WHICH IS THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND LADY OF MCDODLE I THINK THEY WERE CALLED YES MAC DOODLE AND IT WAS ON THEIR LAND AND IT HAD BEEN BUILT AS A LOOKOUT POST I THINK ORIGINALLY FOR THE COAST GUARDS IT WAS A VERY SPARSE IT WAS TO ACUTE PLACE WHO HAD TO REACH IT BUT TO GET TO IT IT WAS A CLIMB UP A CLIFF ALMOST A SHEER CLIFF THE ROAD WENT BELOW US AND THE SHEER CLIFF UP WHICH WE HAD TO CARRY THE OLDEST LAMP BATTERIES WHICH WAS VERY HEAVY AND THEN WE HAD TO HAVE A A COAL FIRE BECAUSE WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO BURN ANY CONFIDENTIAL BOOKS WHICH WE HAD IF ANYTHING IF WE HAD ANY KIND OF AN INVASION AND WE HAD TO PUT THE BOOKS AND GOODNESS KNOWS HOW BECAUSE THEY WERE LEAD LINE THEY WERE SAFE BUT WE THAT WHILE WE HAD THE FIRE AND WE HAD A BUNK DOWN BELOW AND THE SIGNAL UP THE TOP AND A BALCONY ALL ROUND WE HAD A BIG TEN INCH AND THREE OLDEST LAMPS AM AN ARTY AT OUR TEA SET AND IT WAS REALLY JUST GO NOW THAT WAS IT WE JUST PUSHED INTO THE DEEP END AM AND HOW FAR COULD YOU SEE FROM MARY WHAT WAS YOUR WE COULD SEE A LITERARY THAT WHERE SHE GOT IT WE COULD SEE RIGHT FROM WE COULD SEE MALE RIGHT AWAY DOWN TO MULL OVER TO LISMORE WHERE WE HAD PERFECT VISION OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS COMING AND GOING WHY WAS THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT STRETCH OF COASTLINE IN TERMS OF THE CONVOYS WERE BECAUSE IT WAS VERY SAFE AM THEY THOUGHT AM THEY COULD COME IN IT WAS IF YOU COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE MAP AND THERE'S A COMPLETE BAY AND TOBE MARRY THE ESCORT SHIPS AM USUALLY ABOUT TWO OR THREE DESTROYERS WOULD DROP THE CONVOY OFF AND GO UP TO TOBERMORRY AND THEY WOULD GO UP TO UP THE SOUND OF MULL AND IF YOU CAN VISUALIZE THAT COAST LINE MULL ALMOST PROTECTS THE BAY SO THE ANY SHIPS PASSING HAVE TO GO ROUND BEHIND THE MALL THEY DON'T REALIZE YOU KNOW THAT THE COMING IN LET'S TELL THE STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK AM I THINK IT WAS A VERY SAFE HAVEN AND THEY CAME IN THEY WERE ESCORTED OFF FROM US PROBABLY DOWN TO A GOROKGAN WOULD GO INTO THE CLYDE FOR UNLOADING OR THEY WOULD MASS UP READY TO GO OUT WITH EITHER AND EXPECT T OF ARRIVAL OR AN EXPECTED TIME OF DISPATCH THEY WERE EITHER COMING OR GOING AND WHAT WAS THE MOST SHIPS YOU THINK YOU EVER SAW THEM I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE HARBOR WOULD BE FULL I WOULD SAY THIRTY OR THAT YES THIRTY MOST LIKELY AND OF COURSE YOU'D HAD TO HAVE A LIST AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW YOU THINK MY MIGHT BE A STRAGGLER BUT THEY WEREN'T THEY NEVER CAME IN YOU HAVE THAT WAS THE TERRIBLE THING YOU THINK I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ONE AND WE HAD QUITE A LOT OF LOSSES UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN THE NOT IN THE BAY BUT YOU KNOW COMING AND GOING YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE THE YET BECAUSE WE HAVE WE HAVE A LIST SENT TO US WHICH WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL LIST AN EXPECTED TIME OF ARRIVAL AND YOU'D GIVE THEM ABOUT TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT THEY NEVER CAME YOU KNOW YOU JUST WONDER WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WERE ALL MANNED BY A MOSTLY MERCHANT MERCHANT MEN SO THEIR MORSE WASN'T VERY GOOD BUT NOW AND AGAIN YOU'D GET A SHIP WHICH HAD A FEW NAXAUNITED STATES WHEN WHEN AMERICA CAME IN IT WAS BETTER PLANNED YOU KNOW THE LIBERTY SHIPS CAME THEN AND THEY WERE BETTER BETTER BETTER MANNED THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OVERPOWERING REALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO SHALL I SAY THIS OVER CLEVER THEY USED TO SEND MORSE AT THE RATE OF KNOTS THINKING THAT WE COULDN'T ANSWER IT AND WE WOULD SEND BACK AT THE SAME RATE AM MISSUS WAY DIDN'T LIKE THE AMERICANS VERY MUCH I'M AFRAID AM THEY TRIED ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY TRIED TO COME UP UP UP TO OUR SIGNAL STATION AND WE WE COULDN'T HAVE THEM IN WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM IN WE HAD ONE OR TWO PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE COMING UP AM ONE SHALL I GO ON ONE NIGHT AM I COULD HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE THING AND A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND I THOUGHT IN THIS VOICE I DIDN'T UNDER WHO IT WAS AT THE MAN'S VOICE WE ALREADY HAD ME AREN MURDERED INVERARI OR V S REN MURDERED AT INVERARI ON NIGHT WATCH SO WE WERE ALL VERY WARM BY WHICH IN AN INTENSE WE ALL WERE TAUGHT HOW TO HANDLE A PISTOL WE HAD TO GO ON THE RANGE WHICH WAS THE REF HAD ARRANGED AND WE WERE TAKEN ON TO THE RANGE BY AN INSTRUCTOR AND TALK TO FIRE A PISTOL AND I CAME VERY SMALL RISKS AND I WAS TAUGHT TO FIRE HOLDING MY WRIST SO I COULD FIRE WITH MY WRIST WE ALSO HAD A RIFLE UP UP IN THE SIGNAL STATION IT WASN'T LOADED HAS NO AMMUNITION IN IT BUT THE PISTOLS WERE THAT BUT THIS RIFLE WASN'T LOADED IT WAS JUST THERE AS AS A WARNING I HEARD HIS FOOT AND THIS IS PERFECTLY TRUE WELL I HEARD HIS FOOTSTEPS COMING UP AND I SAID TO MY OPPO I DON'T LIKE THIS VERY MUCH SO THIS BLOT KEPT KNOCKING ON THE DOOR IN THE END I CAUGHT THIS RIFLE AND I THOUGHT AND I CAN'T I KNEW IT WAS UNLOADED AND I THOUGHT NOW WHAT AM I GOING TO DO SO I PUSHED HER OUT THE OTHER WAY AND AS THIS VOICE CAME THROUGH THE THING I LIFTED IT UP AND WAS GOING TO CLOG HIM ON THE HEAD WITH IT HE SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT JOAN IT'S ONLY ME AND IT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNAL MEN FROM DOWN BELOW STUPID WHO'D GOT A DATE I HAD CHANGED WATCHES WITH THE GIRL I SHOULDN'T TELL TO TELL HER THIS REALLY HE OBVIOUSLY USED TO COME UP FOR A CUP OF TEA AT THIS TIME AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH HER AND HE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON WATCH AND HE NEARLY GOT HIMSELF KILLED AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NO I WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE IN MY RIGHTS BECAUSE WHEN NOBODY HAD GOT A GREAT BIG PROHIBITED NOTIONS UP AT ME DOOR BUT I KNOW IT NEVER NEVER EVER CAME TO ANYTHING AND I NEVER EVER REPORTED IT BECAUSE WHEN I GOT HIM INTO TERRIBLE TROUBLE BUT WE WERE ARMED BUT ONLY WITH A PISTOL AND HAD A RIFLE WITH NO AMMUNITION BECAUSE WE'D HAD A RENT IN INVERARI WHAT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T KNOW IF I'M AFRAID ALL THAT IS A NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WE WERE JUST TOLD TO BE VERY AWARE AND YOU TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS AND I THINK MEN STEPNEY MENTIONS THIS IN HER BOOK AS WELL WE NEVER EVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED AND WE WE HAD WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A SPY OR A MAN USED TO COME DOWN IT WAS ALL PROHIBITED LAND FOR CIVILIANS BUT THIS MAN USED TO COME DOWN SIT ON THE ROCKS AND WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS AND HE HAD BINOCULARS AND A CAMERA WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CONVOYS WE COULD TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AROUND THE OUR CABIN AND AROUND THE THING BUT NOT THE CONVOYS NOT ALLOWED TO AND SO WE REPORTED THIS MAN TO OUR HEADQUARTERS BACK IN THE SIGNAL BACK IN THE STATION HOTEL NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ABOUT IT SO HE HE JUST DISAPPEARED NOW WE NEVER EVER HEARD WHETHER HE WAS JUST A LOCAL NEWSPAPER MAN OR WHETHER HE WAS A GAME KIND OF A SPY OR WHETHER HE WAS JUST INTERESTED IN SHIPS WE NEVER HEARD SEE I'M AFRAID IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS ALL NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD AND JUST YOU KNOW JUST PICKING UP ON THE AMERICANS WHILE YOU WERE USED TO TAKING OUT TO BE AS THE AMERICANS GAVE YOU SOME HASSLE A YES WELL THEY WOULD TRYING TO BRIBE US THEY WANTED TO COME UP THE SIGNAL STATION A LOOK NOW LOOK HONEY WE'VE GOT SOME NYLONS OH HONEY WE'VE GOT BANANAS ON BOARD YOU KNOW THIS MAN SO STUPID AND SO CHILDISH WE TOOK A DISLIKE TO THEM WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE WAS THE WAY THEY USED TO TREAT THEIR OFFICERS COMPLETE DISRESPECT THEY WOULD CALL THEM BY THEIR FIRST NAMES WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS TERRIBLE AND THE CAPTAINS AND ALL THE ONE OFFICERS NEVER SEEMED TO TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THEM WE WERE IN OBAN ONE DAY SHOPPING AND THE AMERICANS WHO CAN CAME ON BOARD CAME ON POVERTY SHOPPING AS WELL AND WOULD BE GLAD TO TAKE US FOR A CUP OF COFFEE OKAY FINE WHICH THEY DID WE TOOK WE TOOK THEM TO THE Y M C A WE HAD A CUP OF COFFEE GOING BACK SOME OF THEIR OFFICERS WERE COMING THE OTHER WAY WHEN WE WERE APPALLED THE WAY THEY SPOKE NO SALUTING HIGHER HIGHER CAP I THOUGHT THIS IS TERRIBLE I MEAN I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT THEY WERE JUST ANOTHER WORLD AWAY AND THEY WERE TRYING TO BRIBE US WITH BANANAS AND NYLONS AND WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW DIDN'T PUT ON TO KNOW WE THOUGHT THAT WAS SO CHILDISH WITH ALL THIS VERY FAST FLASHING MOSS YOU TOUCHED ON THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF ER YOU NO COMMUNICATION HE HAD THE SAME FOR YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LAMPS THERE YET WILL ALLOW SO JUST WHEN DID YOU USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNICATION NOW IS ONE SPECIFIC TYPE IN A BIN IN THE STATION AND ARE ALWAYS BY MARS BY LIGHT OR SOMETIMES BY ART NEARLY ALWAYS RELY THE ARTY WE RE REALLY ONLY USED FOR THE AZTEC STATION A LAMP MOSTLY THE OLDEST AND ALL THE BIG TEN INCH WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT OF COURSE TO HANDLE YOU HAD TO GO OUT ON THE BAR AND OF COURSE IF UP THERE THE WINDS WERE ALWAYS AT GALE FORCE AND WE ALWAYS HAD TO HOIST THE THE CONES FOR THE WET FOR THE WEATHER EVERY DAY WE HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOR THE CONVOYS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER WAS WHAT WERE THE CONES THE CONES WERE WE PUT OUT OF IT COME WITH A SHAPE LIKE THAT AND YOU HOISTED IT AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH WAY NOW UPWARDS FOR UPWARDS FOR THE NORTH WIND AND DOWN FOR THE SOUTH WIND VERY PRIMITIVE BUT IT GAVE THEM SOME IDEA OF THE WAY THE WIND I MEAN ANOTHER THING YOU MEAN YOU COULD TELL THE WAY THE WIND WAS BLOWING JUST LOOK AT THE END FROM WHICH WE ALWAYS HAD TO FLY THE WHITE ANSON AND WE HAD TO ABIDE BY THE COLORS OF THE WHITE ENDS IN PUT IT UP AT SUNRISE AND DOWN AT SUNSET SO THE ENSO WAS ALWAYS FLYING SO YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHICH WAY THE WIND WAS GO BLOWING WITHOUT THE CONE BUT IT WAS A GALE FORCE WIND WE USED TO PUT THE CON UP WHICH SOMETIMES MEANT THE COMB WAS UP FOR DAYS CAUSE THE GALES WOULD BLOW UP THERE VERY VERY VERY WINDY AND SOMETIMES WE WOULD HAVE TO BE LASHED ON TO THE TEN INCH BY OUR OPA BECAUSE IT WAS SO WINDY YOU KEPT BEING BLOWN AWAY IT WAS IT WAS VERY VERY COLD AND VERY VERY WE WERE ALWAYS WET BUT WE DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER DID YOU HAVE TO GET A BATHROOM WHEN WE WENT BACK TO THE GATE OF THE HOW LONG WOULD YOU BE AS SITUATED UP THERE WELL THE NIGHT WATCH WAS A LONG ONE WE'D GO ON SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT O'CLOCK AND COME OFF AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING THAT WAS A VERY LONG ONE AM THE OTHER WATCHES WERE PRETTY WELL FOUR HOURS ON A FOUR HOURS OFF BUT THE NIGHT WATCH WAS IT WAS A TOUGH ONE BUT YOU SAID YOU HAD TO WALK THERE AND THAT FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO WALK WE COULDN'T BE OBJECTED BECAUSE THE MAN IN MEN IN THE ESTIC STATION DOWN BELOW US GOT TRANSPORT THEY WERE WORKING THE SAME WATCHES OH WELL YES OKAY THEN THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD ISSUE US WITH BICYCLES WHICH THEY DID AM WE HAD A WREN OFFICER CAME UP TO SEE US AND HE SAID THIS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND THEN THEY SUPPLIED TRANSPORT FOR US SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK THE NIGHT WATCH BACKWARDS AND FOR THREE OR FOUR MILES IN THE PITCH DARK ALONG A ALL THE COAST ROAD BUT FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO BEFORE THEY REALIZED THAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT THE MOMENT THERE'S A STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK HERE THE DUKE OF YORK BUT WE WE NEVER HAD THE VERY BIG SHIPS THE BIGGEST SHIP THE ESCORT SHIP THAT EVER REALLY CAME IN TO US WE WERE DESTROYERS OR OR COVER COVETS AM BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS USED TO GO INTO MALL TO WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS TO GO BACK OUT SO WE NEVER REALLY HAD ANYTHING WHAT I WOULD CALL VERY LARGE I WAS ON WATCH WITH STEPNEY ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION AND IF YOU CAN PICTURE YOU KNOW THE ISLAND AND THE SEA AND SUDDENLY YOU SEE A GREAT BIG CROSS ANCHORED ACROSS MOST COMING ACTUALLY WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE AND WE HAD NO E T A FOR ANYTHING WE HAD NOTHING WHAT EVERYTHING WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY NOW IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT OF COURSE WE CALLED IT UP NO REPLY COURSE THAT WAS WORRYING NO REPLY BECAUSE IT'S A SPECIAL EVERY EVERY HOUR IT CHANGED THE CALL UP SIGN CHANGED ON A CODE BOOK SO YOU WOULD CALL THEM UP BY THE CODE WHICH IT WERE FOR THE DAY NO REPLY SO WE HAD A LITTLE SHIP WE HAD TWO SHIPS ACTUALLY ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN STAR ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN WAVE AND THEY WERE PATROL SHIPS WHICH USED TO PATROL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AMONG THE CONVOYS ALL THE TIME THEY WERE OLD WHAT I WOULD CALL SOMETHING LIKE A CORVETTE AM I THINK THEY WERE OLD TRAWLERS MEN WERE MANNED BY A NAVY AND THEY WERE AT WHAT IF ANY TROUBLE WE CALLED THEM UP IMMEDIATELY AND WHEN WE CALLED OUT THE SOUTHERN STAR SHE WAS A RIGHT WAY WAY OUT OVER A MILE AND ASKED HER WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHE SAID I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING FROM HERE BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE IN A WAY WAY BUT SHE I'LL GO AND INVESTIGATE SHE SAID IF IT'S ENDING TROUBLE I'LL PUT A SHOT ACROSS ITS BOWELS THAT WAS THAT ANYWAY THIS THING GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER EVENTUALLY I MANAGED TO CALL UP I OBVIOUSLY THE THE BUNTING TOSSER THAT'S WHAT VISUAL SIGNALS ARE CALLED BUNTING TOSSES WAS ASLEEP I SHOULD THINK HE THOUGHT WE WERE ONLY CAROUSING ROUND THESE ISLANDS AND HE CAME BACK QUICKLY WITH D OF WHY INSTEAD OF A PENNANT NUMBER BECAUSE ALL SHIPS HAVE PENNED NUMBERS EITHER THE PENNANT NUMBER OF THE SHIP OR THE COD WE CAME BACK WITH NOTHING QUICKLY DE WHY AND I SAID TO STEPHANE DEO DUKE OF YORK I SAID GOSH IT'S A BATTLESHIP I SAID BAS DON'T KNOW SO WE QUICKLY FOUND OUR BASE AND THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE US CAUSE NOBODY HAD GOT AN E T A ANYWAY THE CAPTAIN OF THE AIM OUR CAPTAIN OF THE BASE CAME RUSHING DOWN TOOK HIM ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO GET TO US BY WHICH TIME SHE WAS IN FULL VIEW MASSACRE IT JUST FILLED UP THE WHOLE OF THE BAY I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT AND OF COURSE IT WAS A GREAT BIG HOAR ABOUT THIS WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW BUT OF COURSE SHE WAS ON SHE WAS ON PILGRIMAGE UP TO NORWAY AFTER THE ERMISHAN HOST AND SHE WAS DOING THIS TO I SUPPOSE SHE THOUGHT WE GOT TIME TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DID IT THEY WERE WAY OFF COURSE I MEAN IT BEEN NOTHING WHATEVER SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN THE CAT WAS WAY VERY WELL CASE IT'S VERY DANGEROUS OUT THERE BUT SHE DID SHE CAME RIGHT PAST US STAYING JUST OFF MULL I MEAN I COULD SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE SHE WAS IT WAS A MAP AND SHE JUST APPEARED BEHIND THE ISLAND AS IF IT WAS ON SOME KIND OF A FILM IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND IT'S SORT OF THING YOU TO DREAM ABOUT LOVE STORY LOVE STORY BUT NOBODY EVER REALLY AGAIN GAINED NEED TO KNOW WE NEVER EVER REALLY FOUND OUT BUT WE REALIZED AFTERWARDS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHE WAS ON HER WAY UP TO THE BATTLE IN NORWAY DRINK OF TEA PLEASE THE DAY OR YET WE D DAY CAME WE HAD ALL THE SHIPS WE HAD WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT WHY THEY LOOKED SO DREADFUL THEY WERE ALL SORTS OF BATTERED SHIPS WE THOUGHT WELL WE HAD SEEN SOME AWFUL SIGHTS BUT THEY WERE THERE WERE ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY OF THEM I SHOULD THINK WITH WITH TWO DESTROYERS DURBAN AND SOMETHING ELSE ONE ON ONE WAS THE DURBAN ONE WAS SOME MAYBE I'VE WRITTEN IT MAYBE SHE'S MENTIONED THEM IN THE BOOK ANYWAY AND WE THOUGHT GOSH I DESTROY DOESN'T WAS TERRIBLE STATE SURELY THE NAVY KNOW THERE WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE THEY CAME IN I SUPPOSE THEY WERE IN ABOUT A WEEK OR MORE THAN THAT TEN DAYS ENOUGH TIME FOR STEPHANIE TO GET TO KNOW THIS SIGNAL MAN AND THESE MUST BE TEN DAYS WE STILL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WHY THEY WERE IN SUCH A AND WHY THEY DIDN'T BECAUSE THEY ONLY EVER STAYED FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS BUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A LONG TIME AND WE THOUGHT LOW SOMETHING SOMETHING'S GOING ON THEN ALL OUR WE WERE TOLD WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO POST ANY MORE LETTERS ALL OUR LETTERS WERE TO BE CANCELED ALL OUR POSTAGE OUT WAS TO BE CANCELLED EVERYTHING GOING OUT FROM THE BASE WAS TO BE STOPPED AND WE ALL LEAVE WAS STOPPED AND WE THOUGHT SOMETHING'S IN THE AIR WE KNOW YOU GET THAT FEELING AND WE THOUGHT WHERE ARE THEY GOING WHAT THEY GOING TO DO OF COURSE THEY WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS A NIGHT BEFORE D DAY AT LEAST THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT OR SO THEY SAID AND THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THEY ALL SEEMED TO BE GETTING READY THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG SHIP CAME ALONGSIDE SOME OF THEM AND TOOK OFF A LOT OF STUFF WE THOUGHT THEY DON'T USUALLY UNLOAD HERE IT GOES TO GOUROCK AND GRENNOK WHERE THEY WERE UNLOADING ALL SORTS OF STUFF WE WATCHED THEM THROUGH THE TELESCOPE NO CHAIRS AND TABLES AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS WERE COMING UP WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS DON'T KNOW NEXT DAY WE WERE WHEN WE CAME UP ON WATCH THEY WERE ALL BUSY GETTING READY TO GO OUT AND WE HAD NO EXPECTED TIME OF DEPARTURE AT ALL THEY ALL JUST SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR AND OUR TWO PATROL SHIPS HAD NO IDEA THEY SAID WHAT DO WE DO WHEN THEY'RE GOING WHERE WE WE WE HADN'T WE COULDN'T TELL THEM BECAUSE I WAS SO SECRET AND THAT'S THE END OF THE DE DAY THAT WAS ALL THE BLOCK SHIPS GOING DOWN THEY WERE ALL THE ROTTEN OLD SHIPS THAT NOBODY WANTED THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD BEEN SO BATTLE SCARRED THAT THEY WERE ALMOST UNTHINKABLE THINKABLE SO THEY WERE THE TWO BIG BLOCK SHIPS AND THESE WERE SENT DOWN TO HELP OUT AND WE NEVER EVER HEARD UNTIL THE END OF THE WALL WHERE IT WAS ALL ABOUT AND THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS A THING THAT YOU TOUCHED ON EARLIER BUT I'D LIKE MORE CLARIFICATION ON IT IS IS THAT THE CONVOYS ESSENCE YOU DID TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTATION YOU CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN AGAIN FOR ME A YOU KNOW HOW THE PROCESS A DISPATCH RIDER WOULD ARRIVE FROM BASE IF THE STATION HOTEL WHICH IS THEIR BASE STATCHBRIDER WOULD ARRIVE WITH A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH WOULD CONTAIN T OF THE NEXT CONVOY COMING IN AND RIGHT SO YOU THEN GET IT OUT PUT IN FRONT OF YOU PUT IT UP AND WAIT FOR THE FIRST ONE LITERALLY TO COME IN WE EIGHTY EIGHT NINE HUNDRED REMEMBER PERHAPS THEY WOULDN'T START TO COME INTO O NINE THREE HUNDRED THEY'D OBVIOUSLY BEEN MARKED I SUPPOSE I THINK FROM IRELAND THEY WERE THEN SORT OF MARKED ACROSS WHO WOULD GET THE T OF THEM COMING ACROSS AND THAT WAS LITERALLY HOW WE GOT THE T S FROM A DISPATCH RIDER CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WOULD COME AND I SUPPOSE THEY'RE ABOUT EVERY THE CONVOYS WERE COMING IN QUITE REGULARLY AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH COMING IN BY THE TIME THEY'D GONE OUT AGAIN THE BAY WAS ALWAYS REALLY KNOW ALWAYS CHOCKABLOCK AND OF COURSE YOU GOT ALSO GOT THE R F BOATS GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH THE SUNDERLAND AND THE CATALINA SO IT WAS QUITE A BUSY LITTLE HARBOUR AND EVERY SINGLE THING HAD TO BE LOGGED AND LOGGED OUT IDENTIFIED AND PUT DOWN YOU KNOW I WAS SO YOU HAD TO BE ON WATCH PRETTY WELL AWARE WHAT WAS GOING ON ALL AROUND YOU LITERALLY IN THE AIR WITH THE CATALINAS THIS IS WHY WE HAD TO HAVE SOUTHERN WAVE AND SOUTHERN STAR WHO USED TO BE OUT THEY WERE ALSO SIGNALLING AND TRYING TO GET THEM IT WAS REALLY LIKE A GREAT BIG HERD OF SHEEP AND TWO SHEPHERDS TRYING TO CREPT THEM IN IT WAS IT COULD HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED CHAOS BUT IT WASN'T IT WAS VERY VERY GOOD IT ALWAYS WORKED IT WAS JUST REALLY SHEPHERDING THESE SHIPS WE KNOW A BEATLES BIG LIBERTY SHIP THEY WERE QUITE BIG DID THESE LIBERTY SHIPS HAVE ITS OWN SO COOL SO THAT YOU WOULD EACH YES EACH WE WE KNEW THAT WE KNEW EACH AT ONE WAS WE HAD AN IDENTIFICATION FOR EACH ONE SO WE COULD MARK THEM OFF IF NOT WE GOT THE EVERYONE'S NAME ME IF SOMEONE WERE VERY LONG BUT YES WE HAD AN IDENTIFICATION FOR ALL OF THEM IT YOU HAD TO
