we had nine seaman two four six stokers two yes i think telegraphists and signalmen there was two each of them i think asdics there was three radar there would have been three and then engine room as i say we had the stokers two engine men and one chief po then you had a skipper a first lieutenant lieutenant commander a sub and we had one two three i one lieutenant and one sub lieutenant the sub lieutenant was chart room a lieutenant general lieutenant commander was first number one and the skipper he was head of the family the first lieutenant was a canadian royal navy royal canadian navy fisherman i think so he was also merchant navy yeah very few we didn't like rn we were different we were harry tate's navy churchill's pirates do you know how we became churchill's pirates churchill came along the docks one day and of course we were never in any naval rigs normally we might wear the trousers but anything up top and he asked who the hell is that lot ' and when he was told he said they look like a lot of bloody pirates' that was his words so that's how we picked up the name churchill's pirates and harry tate harry tate was a comedian who could not cope with modern gadgets and that's where harry tate came from the rn called us lilliput navy they didn't like us an instance the flotilla leader would go and do cinema shows you see and of course we'd go on naval trousers khaki shirts flapping open hats on back of the head and walked up the gangplank and the officer of the watch used to go white where in the hell did you come from ' and we told them go on then we had this in gib so you had a great deal of freedom then more than rn much more we weren't so bad you know if need be we were smart if you know what i mean but normally we were doing a job and learnt from the fisherman that originally started that job you know free and easy really skipper was much the same bringing back the ship we had an rn sub and for no reason he would put you in cos report for anything and we'd go to the skipper who sent you ' so and so' oh get out' you never got in trouble give me a feel for the ship and what armament did it have armament we had i'm doing the wolborough i can do the romeo the romeo had a twelve pounder forehead oerlikon port and starboard and five on the stern i mean five is just throwing rocks at them really they were a waste of time anyway that was the romeo she had a depth charge port and starboard and roll off on the stern and the wolborough up front she had a four inch gun great big massive gun she had oerlikons port and starboard and behind the stack the stern and once again throwers port and starboard and roll off depth charges and you know this one was fitted with anti submarine detection and we didn't have the other one aircraft thing that came later on the wolborough and it was great fun really we could see all sorts of things we couldn't see before coastline and things like that you know what was this equipment radar radar we didn't have that originally that came in afterwards it was very handy around the greek islands because when the war finished we were rolling about up there doing all sorts of odd jobs and that was very useful could you tell me then with your training over your first deployment your first operational deployment where that was and what were you doing operational after we got to the med alexandria was our base it was just a matter of waiting for a ship then and the first ship was the romeo and on the romeo we were escorting from alexandria out to the atlantic where the atlantic convoys took over and it was on her that we did the sicily invasion but the romeo had seen better days she was on the way up to the sicily invasion broke down and then we were sitting in the med and skipper wants silence because the engine over fitting something to do with the boiler we had to blow the boiler down and no steam and you know but the noise coming up from the fitters you see how we got away with it i don't know i really don't know but we did and caught up with the convoy and found you know we joined some more close to harbour and not a happy place for us we had to blow the boilers again you see all the boilers and we were laying opposite the boom no steam couldn't move and mr hitler decided he'd have a go and they were dropping them all over we just missed either side we had it missed what was this aircraft yes yes oh yes he didn't like us being there and everyone else that was there he really had a go that night and then on the tannoy we heard this thing come out enemy torpedo boats were trying to have a go at the boom with torpedo's we're right opposite we weren't happy this is the boom defence around the harbour yeah the net yeah we weren't too happy if he had put one through the net we're right in line but never mind from there we had to go across to malta and get a mini fit and of course they were getting it as well weren't they i have nothing for respect for the maltese people how they put up with that day after day after day it really was terrible it was so bad they told us to stand down because the shrapnel coming down from the guns was like rain on the deck great big pieces you know like size of two hands laying on your deck could hear it coming down is this in valletta or yes in the harbour there in valletta yeah we tied alongside you know the convoy that saved malta i never remember the name but anyway the tanker ohio got in there with her oil but then she was sitting on the bottom and we tied alongside her as a birth not knowing anything about her at the time but you know since i've read about it i have a lot of feeling for that ship you know something anyone that's not served i don't think they can understand the feeling you do have for a ship you really do it's your home and i suppose the thing i miss most when i came out was the comradeship you do miss it you really do anyway i changed ships when romeo got back to alexandria she had to go for a proper refit and we came off her then and that was the last i saw of her but now the romeo was quite unique actually her bow turned starboard because the tele motor that controlled the steering broke down as she was entering harbour and just inside the harbour was this base ship that had this commodore aboard you see and we rammed it i wasn't there then romeo rammed it and she had a bent bow which meant she was a bitch to steer oh she was she really was you know they allowed ten degrees either side the compass point but she would go on if you didn't watch her and you were escorting convoys what separation was there between ships oh quite a distance we were sweeping we'd sweep it depends where we'd go out usually a quarter we were on a quarter of the convoy the bigger ships were on forehead and we would sweep what forty five degrees inside you know and you had at a start they gave you the compass reading and they just told you to go on asdic turn over you didn't need to give over you knew it were you in visual contact with the other vessels yes oh yes we weren't close not that close pointless really at night time or even day time actually all you had was slits in front of you to see you know it was armoured plate put there with just slits you couldn't see anything just a compass at nighttime that's all you could see what would that be about four and half five inches square roughly and you're looking up at it at eye level and that's all you could see quite an eye strain and you can imagine you are doing four on and four off minus the dogs when you change and you were tired you really did get tired you could sleep anywhere and i've actually fell asleep at the wheel we had a seat behind the big steering wheel and a little small wheel to steer with and i'd fallen asleep there at night time got blasted from up above he asked where the hell are you going ' you've always got to have it out sir you mustn't let them know' they knew they knew obvious it was always loud on rn wouldn't rn would never allow even our rum ration that was neat we had neat rum whereas the navy was three or four to one did the convoys close up at night no no we kept station as it was we'd sweep away from the convoy you know and that's on a quarter and one on the stern doing the same thing one to each quarter and depending on the size you might have one in the middle but you know not in the middle of the convoy in the middle of the outside your escorts were always on the outside of the convoys
