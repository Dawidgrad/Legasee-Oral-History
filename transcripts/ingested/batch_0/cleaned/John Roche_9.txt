when you started doing the atlantic escorts you had quite a good guest on board oh yes winston churchill we done a special trip for him we went all the way over to canada we went over to halifax to pick him up he'd been at a quebec conference with president roosevelt and he wanted us to bring him back so we steamed over there and went through a big gale on the way we eventually got over there and got into halifax we weren't supposed to tell anybody that we were going over there but they all knew and then he came on board with his wife and children and we then set sail full speed across the atlantic zigzagged all the way the destroyers and u boats couldn't keep up with us in the bad weather also and so we bought him safely back we nearly lost his daughter on the way mary churchill one of the school master officers took her for a walk along the quarter deck the quarter deck was out of bounds because it was a very low part of the ship and when we were at sea zigzagging a mighty amount of water used to wash over the quarter deck so this guy took her for a walk and the next thing a big wave picked them up and washed them along the deck she managed to grab hold of a wire and one of the young officers went down and managed to grab hole of her and pull her back she thought she'd gone if she would've gone of the side we wouldn't of stopped to pick her up it would have been too dangerous winston didn't know anything about this he didn't know until afterwards that evening when she arrived for dinner wearing her clothes and her hair was still wet and he said i don't remember giving you permission to wear civilian clothes for dinner she was in army uniform he didn't know what had happened she celebrated her twenty first birthday on board in nineteen forty three was there a special do for her twenty first there was actually they presented her with a cake and a card and one of the ships kittens the ships cat had kittens on board so they gave her one of the kittens as a present were there any other women on board the renown well of course her mother was board i think there was a couple of typists on board but they would have been up in the offices court i think they were the only women we carried on board actually mary churchill was the only woman to fire a gun on board the renown they took her all round she had a go on all the guns i think she was the only woman in history to fire a gun on hms renown she remembers all those things about the ship you know was it considered bad luck to have a woman on board i never heard it but i knew it had been spoken did it give the crew on hms renown pride to know that they had been selected to have winston churchill on their ship oh yes we were very proud to carry winston he was number one guy we would have carried him anywhere on the second trip we picked him up here in plymouth took him on in the night time nobody knew he was coming on board we picked him up and he was going to alexander that time and the next thing we was down the bay of biscay on our way down at thirty knots with winston onboard so he liked us he came with us twice did he speak to you at all no he would have said get out of my way or something like that that's all he might have said get out of my way or something like that tahts about all he might have said what was it like having him on board did it change the atmosphere it did really i was quite close to them because i was doing the electrical work at that time and one of us had to be near their quarters in case a bulb or a fuse blew or something like that now and again winston would come out and sometime he would want to see a film so he would watch it for five minutes and then come back out he'd be in and out we had this big war room with all the maps we had to put heaps and heaps of light on so he could see the russian front the north african front and the italian front we had all these maps and they all had to be kept up to date he was in and out of there all the time in matter of fact i had to go in there one time because lady churchill had an electric iron from america and it wouldn't work so i had to go in and repair her iron so she could do a bit of ironing so i had a little chat with her she was a lovely lady after that in november we took him out to the mediterranean because he had another conference there took him out to gibraltar then malta then to alexander he flew home from there we took him on two trips we took his other daughter the second time sarah and she was in the air force
