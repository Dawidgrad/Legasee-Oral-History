i born in london city road hospital nineteen twenty six and my mother told me that the snow resort to the rinder sells i hope she meant that this is under the ground floor is a poorly baby when the child killers of those years and therefore is on open order overall dement that every twenty four hours they checked you just to see if you were still and end of your relations coming in at any time to myself and my mother for sending me we're still going alright i was baptized in the hospital chapel and fortunately i managed to overcome that problem join the navy and what were the circumstances around now are they really difficult for people to visitors now always on the people like myself and you wanted to fight back and it is like a burglar trying to break into your door and normal you're stopping and i'm doing a certain amount arp and but i really wanted to go a little bit further so i thought about that well our child try and get a little bit more involved so i went to the local drill hall where they usually take a volunteers for any other free services this morning edgware deansbrook road and volunteers for the tv i came along to pass all the tests and a few weeks later and i'll follow but they couldn't take me at the time because i was only seventeen but they said they take me at seventeen and half riding the the job are you going to do in navy talk about six months so i'll be eighteen at a time when i i could go on board a ship so i when i was started work on monday after that i said to do foreman well i've joined the navy i'm going to go no you can't do that we want you here we doing more work here we can stop you you don't have to join an irish i said i've made up my mind i'll join the navy forget it and it's another bit of luck because that was working one hundred percent with asbestos and not the time but no problem for the course i'll find out later on nearly everybody inept firm that you died of asbestosis so not been another one of my lucky lucky x anyway from their dead on my age twenty and a half a letter arrived and report to the drill hall ware you joined and you'll be taken on from there to hms royal arthur so you really are turned up there a little proud of us but the truck i think it was took us to the station london station the group of us went up to skegness and there we are there we did or dry routine uniform and be told lots of things about a lady lots of horror story on my trade specialist was no nowadays is that day which was right and went on from there after i've parcel the usual test up to hms scotia where i went through the exam for a telegraphist in nineteen forty four i went down from there to roll arthur again and that time d day is under the dead quite enough telegraphy so they run today would you like to change over to sunday hours twelve in and his becoming able seaman and from there there's lots of things you iron for like the sound of that so i will know as i tell her first went down from there to hms ganges candy crush tough you can't say that hard after being in somewhere like and has miscarriage averages quite easy as well because you had had to being able seaman an able seaman and turned out was tough job because i was coming up you did try it in twenty two fifty on the land as well as fight on the sea so i'm going in for practice trionum handgrenades ship jobs and d day happened roll over still they are hungry can hear the fighting going on the other side of harwich from the from the landings and we were giving blood as much as we can for the injured and we were told several times that if the fighting gets any worse and it's horrific now you'll be over there joining them what do you like radio fully trained or not so unfortunately and fighting all the injuries to get tougher than they were so pass holders ironman and then after that sort of wanted to do what i told us abba write two separate you can be elastic operator a gunner or you can be carried out training as a telegraphist radio offraser shamed about next step of anyway that was another short course over the isle of man that they also frigates order land basis stone figures so so far i never even seen a ship only little little wailers and this type of thing we did sale in learn two going to do all the knots and everything in ganges so anyway and if between that when i finished my telegraphy course and they said to me well we're not sure we really want enough to leave this and said there's a lot more options can i have the options it said well one nice job that's coming up nowadays is a cyclamen on landing craft i said what you done all the train in you only have to learn to be a signal man three the plough inn southall but higher came into my head with the landing craft standing up the front they're playing waving and the german shooting at the fly away but no i'm no hero i'll come in to do a job i'm not here i'm so anyway so i finished up as a radar operator there are two types of radar operators to as a radar plot and there is radar an arriva troll carried out in ganges on big guns and ships in heavy guns there that i opted for the radar control gallery so i did that call simon from there i went down to chatham rise chatham writing own way to do for ship why do wait until the ship all you do is walk about the barracks jobs like painting or white or treating up all different places and you go down every evening in your own time to what i believe is called the old phone and i have list of people to go and draught for a ship what a fish one i came across all through for several weeks on my name on there's quite a lot in this draft so we had to go for some reason to have a medical everybody had the past for a medical that was on that draw where is what it is for another tell you i never tell you is known as the silent service and never told anything so i went through medical examination is it came to my turn to see the medical officer he said out how i stand out the one side wait till time and then came across and you should do a german measles well my goodness haven't been anywhere near germany he said don't be funny i must spend a few weeks and sick pay i've got no memory of taller what happened there i don't do anything about me but if you going on the draught in the going on the ship obviously one hundred and nine awkward ownership compartimento few weeks time so my name is on another draught and this was karen and we're not told we just and tobago donna drafted you have the number of overdraft so when the time came there is about one hundred and fifty two two hundred of us from chatham where put on navy tracksuit back to back open back that cupboard truck taken down to the london station i'm not sure which one it was now but all of us put on i'm trying i don't think there's any other any other people and they're trying everyone the doors are locked we were locked in and young lad by the side of his head now getting out now it's not stop the girl getting to us when we get to the station i've had started to chat a lot friendly ben nevis avenue each other come from all over the place that was a long trip up to glasgow glasgow we stopped quite a few time i think for a rage and no reason i believe we stopped at carlisle and the windows are open at very lovely cups of tea and sandwiches past across from the wvs or whoever now anyway after little rest started the train again as read out the station i remember there is a big factory by the side of the station right on the track on and i will meal or something and now his for windows there was balloons on the girls waving the balloon but not summer blue and i can remember although they were a little bit have another type with your intention and that was nice we loved at the fact of there being cheered on our way we eventually arrived in glasgow trial change straight away over to what massive in the local train that trained took us to greenock and destination and then put into it must have been the ymca building and we were then told that we were due to have leadership company and a brand new ship being built in shipyard which is right next door to my favourite ymca really now it wasn't ready i'm where you could go and look over the ship anytime we liked and mass of wires and people welding and i can't really remember what we do we must anyway in a few weeks the chip is ready already on wires and bits and pieces have been removed and brush giving her places on the foreign mystic pointed out where are you at a locker where we put in your clothes were in uniform now call fallout civilian clothes at john sorry just had our own liver clothes the first things we had to do go through trial the trial would have taken up the clyde you had to do this speed determined under gallery tyre car trials anyway when when we finished at the trials and then into the royal navy that was the time going to be off none of us have told that we were going to go on a certain day so if we have having surely vricon tell anybody but then one dark night shortly after his friend is there a child with slip from the doctor outside yard yard yard and edge dry up through the clyde no lights of course the closed order watertight doors or a scuttle headlights and giving there positions that we were on watch then we were real sailors then so i wish i'd watch so therefore i would be up on the half an hour from the starboard what lookout we will never had any actual training for this free just for told to do whatever told i've only way we used out of the clyde you have to go past the moon which to let you out of the tired tired and i remember i came off watch or have you gone on which i can't remember this day but i'd had reason to go to the heads which are the toilets are shut down shouldn't down explosion bag it up quickly rushed out the door into the canteen flat that's just to passageway and bumped into one of the other sailors obviously experience and now it's harder than the depth charges out but shamefaced i didn't go back in the right place so we had a good laugh about that anyway from their why was it all so clandestine when you left the problems at the enemy on news at the ship being built near all the time and they would come out of the clyde or come out of the time or perhaps come out of ireland and if you can visualise ireland and scott and there's it narrows it's really wide it has a long distance but in arrows as a continent and therefore ships have to come in and the area all this is always the places where you'd have to offer you those just looking hoping for a good kill and whether they were ever found the ship for mince pies around as he was coming out at that time i've no idea but that was the most dangerous part there's none of us have work together we can help train you had good training in their own jobs but because we were not meant to say if it were training with so from there you up for a heavy days it was really the put the crusaders that experience and the offices of course aware it's usually that had to have all their knowledge to do what you were doing because you get no one call your ship complete on your own with seventy five the crew that i'd never been to see before they're even seen a ship before very often so if we'd been attacked at that time we had been a sitting duck when we arrived at flow which is relatively safe we go through the room again get into the flow and from then on that you do a training the training at scapa flow really is to get you working as a team a whole shepperton know exactly what they doing are going through a little forty five as you know how to work together if you're in the transmitting station which is the one of the nurses centres like we were gallery control you would have about ten people in that room the charge of an order on sitting room and each one of those had a job to do because i wanna destroy destroy a brand new one as well so nobody knew anything about it we had to learn how to use the fire control table as it was when you get eight people on it and all those eight people loaded training on something similar in the training they still have know how to fight and ships attacked or if that was expected of us in the flower but that time we were so short of destroyers in particular and other escort ships so not only were we staying in an ice a fairy to do our training we were sent out in harness is it was called with another ship that might be more experience but then ok of course there's only one of your dad's is experience and training which us so will you be learnt it the hard way i also have real fighting and was around that time and at the end of nineteen forty four which was october november december was around the area so there's send us out with another ship in monkeyish we were the only ships in the flow destroyers and we were caused you to destroyer a nice peaceful on but you didn't know about that time i was a ship that sunk so we were sent out no no no basic training on this we had a call to go to a ship of cape wrath that have been sunk i've been torpedoed i didn't actually message was not that have been sunk that should have been torpedoed and true destroyed had to go out to try and help to catch the u boat the time care and to pick up survivors if they're only there so there's two of us and it seems i'm from other records i looked up the other she went out with another ship is also working out so there's two destroyers and absolutely no it at all and had to go out to the ship found out later in life it was hms full on which was a escort voucher when they're looking for you both the very you about their been looking for it one of our first i just under the bin song and the other ships that were weather but still looking for the eu vote well the fitting we did ask if i was very knowledgeable very experienced and he went to the where the you where the euro and sank hms edgworth bolton nobody has told anything here it's a special and none of us have told so the first thing you do are you going round temperature depth charging the whole of the area in case to you about it still there when we picked up an echo which told her as the operator that there was something down there which could be the euro so will you get charged that area and apparently the echo we got didn't move it stay there so we assumed that happened to you though and never never came up never got a new oil never got anything so that time the war the only just started so which help them later on in the morning now just you both he didn't come up within twelve hours it was a dead duck so we waited around there all night with a boarding party ready to go on to do about because it would have had to come up here is it and then and it seemed where you had to go on another job i don't know whether you've received the message but we had to go on an escort job so we should down the whole team i was looking at the next morning we stood down the team at the bowling party northern over the side of ship find no work to do i'll just watch and i've just seen it near distance magnetic nine float past but nobody shot had it done usually just in case there you go down there with no that we were still there weever on silent routine all night never started your engines because you didn't want that u boat if it was still alive then down there to know that we're still up there waiting we went back to scapa flow and carried on with there and learning to fight war well this was i told you about was the sixth of december or them small jobs we might have done there i'm not sure but the next important thing that i can remember is that really work and not required for work around the christmas period so we're back into flow and it was quiet and we were save but none of us has had his christmas away from home before this and there were all were in a terrible place dead anything and what's surprise me was is two hundred on this ship profeta on the chips compliment and luckily we have a few and experienced and everywhere the kooks on the mess with making christmas cakes with whatever stuff with you get hold of you also you take it i'm not sure where from a christmas tree for somewhere and that is run up on the top of the mast and the top of every ship at christmas time of the harbour have a christmas tree but she's run up on the top of the chip and we should have been served i think by the officers been christmas but i can't remember whether or not and you're not allowed to have drink on board it's a dry ship that some of the old stages and saved some of their rum ration which one how to dial very very high charge a cold but the offices normally on us on small shed like a destroyer close our eyes to lots of things but they won't be allowed to have they were on the big ship that people a passenger ship so many of the lads stepway allowed around i wasn't because you're not allowed until your twenty week was only eighteen but i kind of rum ration horrible i hate it undone people made up things out of paper and packaging pay for red green and blue came from places out of hi de hi made into decorations and we were order a boy there for the time and christmas songs and put some of the people had instruments we had a small bag on board and some other people i suppose at home that never had it bad very tearful form i came from home that we didn't have much money your christmas wasn't much different from a we all enjoy her first christmas away from home and everybody moving for time because although it was very strict and it was quite happy to turn his light it was a lad the same as later on in the story with when we got that fire released and i'll tell you a little bit more about it but he we had water polo teams and he was on the team with the chickens the offices and that would be and boxing champion of the fleet or part of the fleet and there is another case i'll try it to little while when i go sure so i'm but the next to we we went on really after christmas after christmas with rainbow you really started and learning that there was a boron we would still go out i would as a ship working up together but the first one we went out with i believe two aircraft carriers and this has to be a strong against normal while we didn't know till you're at saying that we were doing this but there is two aircraft carriers some more destroyers i think some other ships now our job was not able to protect the one of the carriers but it was also to act and a lifeboat really when the aircraft took off and i think a couple of those were our old type aircraft i can't remember the name of the but they were biplanes now this was a really rough day and i watch the mama to know much are all the time and i watch them from the deck and the carriers bouncing up and down but they took off and i think they are trying to carry out their task but the two i shall i come back didn't make it because they the ship was dancing up and down the aisle car carrier dancing and one of them hit the deck i was pushed out of order that with the people in it i can't take him out bush tv to make way for another one landing and the other one disappeared i think you had given orders to try and fly back to his base or able to rough the man on the aircraft carrier are they being crashed boat called went to try and find the aircraft that ditched shadow you know aircraft so anyway i think i had to call off the strike could you just too too dangerous to do anymore and lying or anything like that so is that was really a bad but didn't to my more we talk about it how are you see legs terrible most times i went to see but when you when you're on when you're on the lookout for when you're in the ts riches in can't that's yes is down below and that is the transmitting station that takes the that's like a relay from the director tower which is right up the top of the ship through you in eight as today main armament british forty four into guns so already communication number so the director which speak to me the two officers injured director been speaking to me and i would be speaking to the guns but apart from that the director would had any signal down to a big computer the original mechanical computer and the mechanical computer resend that information mechanically to the guns but once i got into a position where there is excitement got all about seasickness ok so that's a good day but normally if i wasn't on one march i'm sending i'll be standing on the upper deck watching the sea up and down and probably being sick the only time you go to action stations is when your expectation action later on i talked about the we were action stations all the time if you're doing a job just escorting that you're at cruising stations and until some trouble popshop i'm deaf charging you vote is not a case of going to action stations it's only if the u boat fights back then you go to action stations go anyway and we went from their back to scapa flow i think we did one or two journeys like this off the coast of y and this is the beginning of nineteen forty five and eventually we supposedly finished our training at work together as a time my jewish time i'm talking about now we were still learning because we were teaming up with people before so if we run into any trouble at that time we wouldn't have had a lot of chance it wasn't her later on when me and learnt these days the next one iphone come is an important long answers in about february on please we were just told we were going to say that night we are not giving any real information about where we were going or what you were going to do but it was very big do a very large force it was real left about one thousand at night i believe this is this is this is what turned out to me the mind latin and operation if it was a very very although there is no moon it was all star light so it is very good visibility and it was a very cold night strangely enough hardly any play wish i tell you tell them know who's with you is the silent service you're not told anything we've been about about an hour or belief about one thousand and the skiffle then sewed overturn i what we was going to do it open his orders told us that we were big force one of the large force we're going down the southern part of norway to eager sons and they were going to attack a convoy we were just one of two ships the other one was azalea's same size the same destroy as we were and now main task with regard to this minor apollo portable both forces working together had to pass through a big ninety four there's a big ninety four that lady we had to go through one path for it but she only pass through it but you already opening was so it should be enough but you do get loose minds so as their corporator had to pick out the mines and i was on what time no good to hear hear me saying that there's something on the port side and the captain of the ship over a bit there anyway we found the minefield all of my no real problem and then we split up we were to wait till twelve another time twelve now the big force where we were by the way up there still at that point and the other big force aircraft carriers at that point and diver going to attack a cornwall a german call my dad was gonna leave you guys aren't going to one hundred coast motorway up to where we were but we were the other folders to stop and get in there so dead on two the other force were going to attack the convoy and they were hoping in that case when that started there'll be lots of fireworks down for a lovely three hundred miles but that would take the heat off what we were doing we were a clandestine operation escort the apollo to the point where you should be going to start laying mine's dead on twelve and we were to be between her and sweden coast and she was sighted on body germans picked up by radar by the germans and labour to start firing we were too much noise record and tear up and down the history between us and between the apollo and the norwegian coast use all the guns and players and everything we could to take the heat off her so the takas show apollo and flash pass or indicated to us or not on the shore because you give everybody had to keep radio silence and we're on toilet routine nobody is allowed to smoke show anything you were not even allowed to the bank because the noise we were not far away from the coast how to and but the trips both us and the other escort destroyed azaleas had to keep up as much steam as we could because if the fireworks started to have the four speed rush up and down this bit of cars for him whatever we could invite them to to the apollo well i could hear from the gun because i'm from the director and before we started doing anything nice idea the people i can't see the headlights there just just over there little bit coming down going from the right to the left and then you said right i've started down the other end and they started firing dad at the other end and i can change it anyway because i downed in eighty that i was getting all the messages from not twenty two offices up in the director tower but from my mates on how you going by gun smoking over there on that anyway under apollo started laying on mine's dead on time to twelve hour clock and the mind flayer not mine the cruiser they are and once they start laying the mine and then they can't stop they've got to do the whole of them alone because the mind being laid so they can't turn back i can only go on and carry on playing their mind up and down and and because i ship is keeping steam up ready for a quick cash up and down the valve blue so you got a normal what is a well known destroyer and apparently everybody went there the cruisers front bed routine and the fact that we will never spell not to the very end i think it might even be if anybody heard that route which is the well known british destroyer signal to say i'm coming a vegetable called a british destroy not being used often often feel like that you know i really way they laid a lady mine and then we knew i don't know about chicken or what she said all done hello we carried out admission see you back in poole and i was at that time listening to some of the and they were saying look at all move and she was doing fourteen knots you run the partnerships they were and they could see the bell wave manage it is night but starlight and you can see you can see the shore you can see the place where the guns were over i would have had a cracker there's so they don't and away apollo and i'm at speed and we turned round but we we went as far so good but we were not allowed to go it because you got a second hold the germans i just out that they were being attacked specialist from eager sand for the background on down there and some friends online afterwards on the apollo when i into a catch up then they said they understood and i renew my leg raises office understood that weird been challenge for saving challenge because it picked up on radar divorce have been challenged and he thinks that the apollo who is in charge of course and given the right challenge answer but then i challenge again later on and didn't go to apollo and started disappearing so the torpedo bombers after and i never found us and we got back ok so the mileage is successful i thought down further and stop the convoy going up to german the german convoy they're done one of the ships and monitor of airships and injured people but the whole successful sounds to me like you were expendable when you're with destroyer and and it's comfortable when the war which won't be in that one is when we were a big falls escort in some of the cruises out to the far east we only took them and then another four states over but we were escorting a battleship down and we were the closest court london each side credit close where is others prefer drought and it's a beautiful day like this and i was none much i just leaning over side but we were quite speak with the closest course i'm just being over the side and over the tunnel i comes away from the captain we're now treating a dangerous area and there might be u boats around if a u boat as father torpedo and that is an pick we see that to track of that torpedo heading towards big sister but i called her down then we stop it you know what we mean when you stop it and there's me looking over the side look at the torpedo go on the way down and thinking yourself yeah you can lose two hundred men just a stopover torpedo bending tool tool peterborough you know just tell me a bit about the role of a destroyer destroyers is there fast and then maneuverable and they're like a smaller version of a cruiser ordinary but small guns so they got big guns four fifty two jones and other smaller guns have you got all those the one thing they've got extra apart from the smaller side scaled down the big ships have not got anti submarine equipment the rachel pedersen x submarines on the surface they got no depth charges so and the destroyer has depth charges so we'll be there too but on the other hand the difference the reason why you got the destroyer as well is just as i said if the capital ship what is there is your garden is torpedoes the last result is you getting away out of torpedo did rather lose a ship that only got two hundred bored than a possibility of losing more than two random men on the battleship remote is it might be a peanut bulge and this is why we sort of sort of destroys because so many of them get get lost because the first thing you do when are torpedo is sighted is it go to attack the submarine the quiet that you should be near enough to get in the way of the torpedo it happens to be heading your way you know when you talk to bed about how you weren't eighty you were very young croup where you thought we're working brilliant in and not really you just took fitting and part of life is you you manage to fit into every situation of your lucky undone you i never worried and you think because you are a good swimmer you must be alright if your shift thinks but then when you when you think about it and you speak to other people you've got she boots on at the time about which i should save you which were all the time at sea but you can't wear that felt blown up because he gets in the way of your arms and so what happens is a few have to jump into the organ as they call it the sea that belt must be blown up because it might tell you expected to blow it up when you hit the same and i can't save it luckily i never had two but i have a survivors that have told me yes i had to blow it up as soon as i hit the water and i had no breath at all left so i can put the tea boots drag you down because it's just one of those things you recall them but it was really monday and even as escort to the monsters that we did the most cases we got battered left right and centre trying to keep up with the queen elizabeth as we took them out of the clyde zigzags all the way with them and we kept up with them till they reached the top please which impreza distance about further wire frost and then we left them and reorder waited around for the sexual and coming in for instance i take the queen mary out and we might have had to wait just a few hours for the queen elizabeth to come in and done all the time one of you night tick what are the three of you at the queen mary will have it so nice dick besides its own radar and of course the stick and radar an hour cohort well today about we would probably be apart at the at the extremes of you at asda circle radar circle so you didn't interfere with each other's receipt of the way and if we picked up an echo which might be nice live in iraq and amazing leaving van up a black flag on our flight deck so the queen mary with no and also the cavalier would know that picked up an echo immediately read hivolt to attack the echo and this is where you're in trouble it is if that's a u boat torpedo and this is where you turn off strictly at full speed of you can if you got to be machine and turn off left or is it would have been seen that destroys got hardly any draught to turn over straight away so you have to be very very good we never did but a bit holders my judgement i don't know then if you haven't been hit by torpedo then is find a way to wherever that echo was and you would attack the echo so you lose off about two that charges from one side to the other and roll of the t rex in the rears pat number ten charges well if the euro is very experienced one and he was watching you on periscope who won be there when you're arrived even either gone down low or he would have disappeared in other direction but least you kept him down no chance of him hitting your charge and then have to try to catch it up take about half a day because they're keeping the same speed is left the two destroyers had to leave the queen mary or the queen elizabeth the queen mary would carry on it wouldn't stop and one of the worst thing that could have happened if they're actually talk period before your mary then they would have lost a lot of lives because while you're the cream if it's coming in the level a full complement of american gis that'll be between ten thousand and fifteen thousand it will be now they would not be able to tighten up there watertight doors to greta going from the different decks all the time in the twenty four hours if we go into action stations they make clothes out tonight doors which means i feel torpedo your mind it will only damaged the compartment your within so the ship most likely won't sink that if it's on the queen mary there's no chance of any there will be closed because the travelling between the differences and dec's prep sleeping on monday throwing up the next step to eat food another debt for exercising always exercise of closure clue for tonight doors so any of those would have been when the biggest disasters weird find what was it like seeing the queen mary the queen elizabeth the sailing ships that you proud of anyway well all we really knew was that we was going to pick up on and monsters will bring one the monsters then what if it was the queen mary and when you're in greenock then we would know it's degree where is taken out and that's always got three tunnels anyway if you picked up he's got three followers to queen mary and queen elizabeth and format for retired now i'm sorry it went on but you never told you were just tile out and go to rendezvous where you wait around or you already contacted that ship to say you're there and you bring it in very often even re two escorts one would be the other liverpool and we would reach a point of rendezvous going out the card and the other one come out of liverpool limits team up together to the rendezvous point for the monster this happened almost wandsworth link for we never had the same cohort and they wouldn't always be in the same area and between that is your duty shit if there is an aircraft carrier which happened in one case an event or beer dose just come down from scarborough to to greenock andrea just arrived at the harmer entrance we went straight to her and because you always have to fill up with oil because you might have to go out and just as real that the isla you got an emergency call to say that an aircraft carrier torpedo just out in the card the card so just let go from the boiler and we went straight out to the the famous aircraft carrier and strangely enough she was on her own just come from londonderry to there's no escort i'm lucky you shouldn't have a compliment over payment sofas and she was coming to to the clyde i don't know why but they still paid that they talk american ship at the same time and you both got away although we went to a packet it was dark and we left the others are they looking for the u boat afters where we came and back end harbour how often you going back to base and getting landlords not very long because you haven't got that much fuel and there's always uses a top speed always be your own you i have good in fuel if you're out for a long time is four from one of the biggest ships from an aircraft carrier or selling it as big as a belfast cruise and also food the food runs out after short while so the only time we really out for a long time is when was up at scapa working up my move going out on porridge to help to bits or doing other jobs the others it was a case of going out just for a day or two to pick up one of the munsters and then come back with the monster i'll take one image with after go to londonderry traps and then we come out londonderry again and get out come out on that we were looking out for a very long there's only one occasion when we was out for a very long time not been over the five days i can't remember what the occasion was but we had run out of food and we were further up in the north atlantic an hour captain x fishery fleet man who had his own fish with sleep and what we decided to do as we run out of food she said i know where the fish mr united the ship out to wear knew they were picked up a shelf on the radar on the aztec dropped a load the boat picked up for the fish that came up this done and stood on the foleshill you said on the phone call and said my mind the biggest one he lived on fish for a few more days after that one mostly just about five days at a time but that meant that every time he came into the ibis in liverpool or to the clyde we had to always had plenty of room because this is your duty destroyer and then if something comes up where ships been sunk you'll have to come out straight away and you might be out for a long time looking for a submarine or eleven sunbury we were lucky in the fact that we never went out for a long time otherwise it would have been boiling nazi which is a dangerous practice anyway and piano food nothing from for me can you describe radar and the different types and the two hundred and ninety three that is high up on the mask and that specially for picking up and aircraft or really any any distance i can't think of the range range of it but it sends out a signal from if it doesn't hear anything you don't get it back but if it's anything even cliffs or an aircraft or surface ship bounces back and on the screen you which is a around screen under the the cursor is going round all the time that was shoaib lip and that blip you have to be able to determine whether it's a cloud which it might be depends on your radar but it's doing vertical and you read off the distance and angle of everything if this is mostly on a level that you have another screen which gives you the height of an aircraft so you use one with the other that that signal electronic signal hits anything that it returns and then you read off the distance of it but is it easy to use to you where you find a difficulty is my experience you know what you're looking for the land because of the size of it on there is a small blip then it's is an aircraft a ship or whenever is if you know you're using one rider it's only on the horizontal if you using another one that can be horizontal or an aircraft and it will give you a good distance the time it takes of course is based on it open s it from there to there then and you read it often screen luckily we never had any trouble with aircraft the only time he would have had problems with that is just a torpedo bombers have been sent off to us or of norway then we would have had to use that no they would have to use the tomb raider sex then the one that gives you a single in the height of the aircraft the other one which gives the distance of it then you you're trying to know richard the difference and i also believe that fifty remember if it was one of her own aircraft it would have no identification signal which you would know on your radar set before it got to you so you would have to bed pretty well experience but i'm always on a radar see you sometime lookout was just saying what you're sitting up in the lookout box on the starboard side as mine and you're looking at three which was not very often resolve surface ships or more than likely you're looking out for a little tiny periscope which is very hard to see enough or you might be unlucky enough to see the track of a torpedo coming towards you medication get into a panic and call out quickly to the people on the bridge and the people on the fridge and the captain all the officer at the time in those days it was an open nose and closed and open bridge so the bridges here you got a lookout busy just here to just call out to that person under officer ship bearing red five hundred green fifty with position is angela site if it's an aircraft and look at it decide what action to take but if you're not look out position which i was on friday lots of semen is rough because there's the ship goes down all the time being a destroyer you're always a submarine at times a whole of the sea view you get knocked back again to search your and it is very damp that is very very uncomfortable but and this is where to use to you used to wear a special suit with cavity completely waterproof suit with k pop violin but even even that the water all the way down and you got soaking wet i remember coming off watch online application like this because normally you have to climb back down on an outside ladder to the ship because the doors that you were going in and out in port or open when you're at see those doors closed because the order comes in those so you have to climb down ladders down the outside does he not outside in the sea calm down from the top that to her now they have no careful the waving it hits do you can get washed away so you hold on very tight well this was the middle watch that i can recall which is twelve in the morning before four in the morning to four in the morning but you're not on watch lookout all that time of the four hour watch you do different job or found unlock out half hour i'll set off out one half hour behind a gun where there's a go at you become so if you did have to go into action you would do the shooting while the real going through is called up to take over from on this occasion it been very wet outside i got token and tired of say middlewich probably be there four i'll come down and went to my mistake richard in afocal is a rough part of the trip on her i hadn't love my hammock or slept on new cushions the time i didn't answer the question to the ship that goes how much as way when you come off the cushions so i got down under do is about that much water on the floor adept sorry not for on the date about that much so i got over clothes on this record it and everything i'm lying down there after sleep straight away next to go now i thought touch me and i hope not blurry eyes and there is the office for the watch and the leading seaman in a mess and he was trying to me i'm told it in the morning by the leading hand and the mess he said the officer said you come on see him and you can't sleep under there is too wet noted and you looked at the leading hand and said what did he say and the fridge let me sleep there are nothing about it the decks of the ships were inside now inside your mess deck the water just it's one temperature outside and a little bit warmer in have you got all humidity all the water runs down the inside of the decks anytime you want the cavalier you you have a look inside your metalwork the ship sign is only about eight of an inch and notecka than that and phones they're that you got watermaster time on that when you text when you're excited and you and harvey you not too bad it's a bit uncomfortable there was another time when we worked with the queen mary and pick her up to bring him we went out and it's in my old one of the rapper stones does it really bad free really rough storms in the period we working in the atlantic and what we had to at this time it be about march nineteen forty five we had to go and pick up the queen mary now the storm have been reading all the way from them and it must have been one of the come across our way and been creamery approach weather so we picked up and i think we're a day or waiting to pick her up because even she had been held up by the bad storms or under i don't know which was the sister ship at that time but we got really bent up we lost her a motorboat we lost one of the wireless and we got really knocked about and when we got towards the floor light between the primary knowing that area that they would be you though but had to rely on her facebook so has got with inhaling distance another clyde and the queen mary decided she couldn't slow down to keep up with us we would have been turned over and flash the message to you in a card and she kept her speed and got end of the clyde now she had the whole of front of her bridge stoves oven and it's a big ship and went up in there there's a lot of casualties because they carrying about twelve thousand troops and this was now late at night i think about eleven at night and anyway she's got into live without anything but damage from from the flu relenting later on now and clyde you're not allowed to run anchor and you can go further then to get up the greenock because after that you go through the boom and the bathroom is closed at night and this is absolutely necessary open the boom prevents helps to prevent any u boats getting at that point so at the other side where we to run a boy we have two boys jumpers to try up to a boy you have to stop and you have to know you wyler with the boy jumper and the routers in it to take you to the boy with the train the cliff it to the ball well if i've given you a picture of our rough the storm was it was almost impossible that first whaler wee wee and let down onto the water managed to get down safely they got washed away with a crew in it for the downer clyde that was away for about three or four hours reminders to lower another wyler all of us was up on the phone so we are all the same in that could help as up on the folks or and because you can't use your anchor and just usually and iron which goes with a wire attached to the end of the anchor chain under wilder have to take this wire to the by to plant it onto the boy and then the boys pulled by the anchor chain nearer to chip saturday click it on the managed to get onto the boy and injuries her wrist and in the end of about four hours we managed to clip up to the boy and the top ten around i hate the smell of and never would have had the door because the horrible but i had it that night we were frozen frozen stuff and juventus to get away with it but nothing was ever said about this time of feeling because although people at the porks new these big ships come come in it i think that was talked about the germans also knew that they were bringing it all these large numbers between ten and fifteen thousand troops it could carry any of the u boat captains i understand this is normal knowledge were offered a large sum of money flowers and thank you georgia thirty thousand and twelve the of honours to have knocked down any one of the month but we never lost one fortunately and i did say but the queen mary and was really battered very badly battered we didn't get turned over i got no idea can you talk about big steve's what sort of size you too well if you're did the series itself is generally known that some of the ways with sixty foot high now if you think of sixty four going up that way when you go up to the way you and you come down to the truth one hundred and twenty four and there's no way you can cut through those ways and the big ship to order small ships you actually go up on that wave and then you feel crunch like that and then you up to next one and all the time you're corkscrew no you're not still and you'll get used to this after that first few months because you've got bruises all over the place because she you go to normal and flats record on the destroyer the normal corridor on the floor on a destroyer which is about that why well when you first cardboard one like that and it is fairly common you said out together from greenock but is your walk along the deck comes up to me to is it goes up then you hit your feet as you go down under deck that before you know it that deck has gone away as the ship goes down elicits you from the top and then well that's happening because you're doing this this ball cats next you know that don't get it yourself in time you learn to walk like a sailor and who's the ship goes down you go down with it and come up with it you're fine tyres when i get the shore i work with a roll to roll that is just that they're still walking towards the end of the day we were on the ninth of may france and i will notice that the peace and have been declared for the next day and where are you going into great in degree look so we actually brought in the last of the one ship convoys before the war ended so we arrived in greenock total wednesday or sunday and half the ships company was allowed leave which wasn't meal but i want to show to greenock then we still carried on with someone is convoys half of the average person there is quite a few of the u boats that apparently missing and lock them home one or two went to whatever so there is still a chance that there was a rogue you vote around and could have knocked down some of the monsters real children and we are no problems at all but the qatar long story short anyway we were then destined to go across to the end of the japanese war so twenty two flotilla went in for refits we were engine for a refit late in may june and cos we were going out there anyway but fortunately while i was on this leave to go out there the ship was down at devonport been refunded the war ended i was still got the telegram to say days leave extra day's leave extra when we came back to the trip still allowed to go out there because we were having a clear up after the wall well and the whole of after the tell her well then we were the last two so as we read out gibraltar mortar aidan place like that river thought we was in a lovely sandwich crew but then when we got to singapore know when we've got to trincomalee at the naval base and basically holiday and also based at singapore to singapore this is just about a week or two after the evil and we were carrying out an exercise with sussex and another ship and the captain of the leader who was on hms caesar and housing cavalier marauder to go with the sussex to a problem showing immediately went for speed when you were sent to jama we have stopped on a couple of troops on the way i can't remember much about that there's a bit but we talk on board our fault beck was covered with indian troops and indian troops and the cavalier azhar sian and the caesar was also and the six anchor outside for a baker's it come within we could order today because there was a song can japanese in there in the way i was season one in first cos she is for the delivery that was full of troops we ran in seconds as we were second and then the cavalier which we went in at daylight we had all his troops on board so if his dad any trouble is going to be used airguns because of lucky we didn't have any trouble from the shore but we came into to a buyer looking over the side and there is bodies doesn't bother me in white naval uniforms i think they're club probably dutch i don't think there is a hard but very slowly moving avoiding the wreckage and avoid in the bodies and you got to the stage now when your body's in the world made no difference to you is it accepted the fact that they were bodies and dead and lincoln in the the doctor there and i'm eleven cruiser disgorged her troops first and hannah next saturday three of us all our troops went ashore the dogs have been already taken over by an hour the uk army or they have been brought in a head london it was the indonesian indonesian rebels that fighting is already killed i'm brigadier melody that was the army and wash on and went to shaw and we stayed there ready for a lot of survivors of the dutch people they were going to be brought across from account right the other side of a buyer and they're really going to be brought under nescol other and editors should have been killed under a truce supposed to be in about four thousand dutch people women and children mostly in a camp the other time they're going to be brought across by another truce army trucks and guarded by indian troops going to be brought across the last and we've got to have another on board and we were able to take them out through the truthers which converted into the harbour well we were then told while we wait for these people to come across we were to go out into the water the address for used which was which was there is it happened when this convoy of army trucks guarded by troops got asura's to a buyer they found that there were stopped willowherb white flag never stop by the post office which was for indian indonesian rebels indian rebels your setup trench mortars and machineguns and as soon as they come when i got there they shop in troops at rough garden the cowboy and the cowboy come to the whole so we were called in to use a four inch forty five guns so we had to run down and we took out the post office with the indonesian troops in it and then the convoy come through we went back into harbour we had already much people on board and we took them out to you soon play warehouses and i'm showing but we didn't actually have to do any fighting fighting red to do with trying to go on the upper deck at the time when you record in the file and i was called off the other dick and the follow my done and i said i'm not gonna today so i put me on the on the gallery with another one and we had a fall out to directions all that i possibly that was sent up by the army on spotify and apparently we took out a new post office so i could do with something today we did have a member overnight dutch people we vocated order for a mess texts and had a sleep down after the other day and different places and the dutch people are in the front there till we turn out to the other ships that and then place back on all of the paris and also disappeared how do you feel when you're selling into a harbour then you're seeing a lot of day neighbour people well you you're pretty your apprehensive to start with but at the age you are and you're very solvent frightening i suppose you enjoy adrenaline and then comes back later on and then sent yourself well i couldn't kill there now but i wasn't and then that's how you took it if you couldn't turn it just thought of all these things at the time you'll be a nervous wreck eighteen years old and nineteen years old and anything happens and fortunately you accept it it's not fair sometimes i work i think back an hour and say i could have been cured here but i'm not i'm here so has justin fletcher died it was exciting what a big way to end the war to end all naval service please to be involved in you no contact like that is it is nice to be at this stage know that you've done certain jobs where instead of well we're not to kill people by by taking out the post the post office but you didn't see on and you and you know by doing that you help to save that help to say the loss of traps and even took three hundred of four thousand people and had the same here in about when we were escort in the troopers that we never knew whether we had some cos i'm really are you both be christmas day is long enough or we could do with step charge a target and set target was you vote then we might have a wait martin cutaway but will job to look after a ship coming in the fifteen thousand troops and he said that i'm happy but you don't know i just hope you didn't i just hope that there wasn't there and that there is people they were only doing that sort of thing that we will do and that is a job
