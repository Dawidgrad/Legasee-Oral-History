MY NAME IS JOHN DOUGLAS WOODWOOD I'M EIGHTY NINE YEARS OLD I WAS BORN ON THE SEVENTH OF APRIL NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR WHEN IN TE SERVICE I HAD ORIGINALLY JOINED TO BE A SIGNALLER AND THEY FOUND OUT I WAS COLOUR BLIND SO I WAS AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE STEWARDING BRANCH WHICH I DIDN'T WANT BUT YOU HAD NO CHOICE YOU DID WHAT YOU WERE TOLD AND I GOT TRANSFERRED TO MINE SWEEPERS AND ER I WAS BASED ON THE ISE OF SHIP HERE AT QUEENSBOROUGH QUEENSLAND QUEENBOROUGH PIER AND WE HAD ABOUT ER TEN MINUS FEEBER THERE AN WE WENT OUT EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS TO SWEEP ANY MINES THAT HAD BEEN DROPPED BY THE BOATS IN THE HOPE OF SINKING OUR SUPPLY SHIPS WHY DID YOU JOIN THE NAVY CAUSE I WANTED TO GEIN THE FIGHT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND AT THE TIME I WAS ER WHAT ARE THEY CALL IN A RESERVED OCCUPATION I WAS EAN APPRENTICE AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER AND MY DAD DIDN'T WANT ME TO ERM JOIN UP HE WAS IN THE LAST WAR AND HE WOULD AVE PREFERRED ME TO LEARN A GOOD STEADY TRADE BUT I WANTED TO GO SO AS SOON AS I WAS EIGHTEEN I WENT OER FROM MADSTONE WHERE OUR HOME WAS I CAME OVER TO CHATHAM TO PEMBROKE BARRACKS AND ERM SIGNED UP I SAID I WAS NINETEEN BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE THEY JUST ACCEPTED YOU IF YOU COULD ERBREATHE IN OUT AND MOVE YOUR ARMS YOU WERE PHYSICALLY FIT I WAS TOLD TO GO HOME AND WAIT AND I'D BE CONTACTED NABOUT A WEEK LATER THE ONVEOP CAME REPORTS AT CHATHAM BARRACKS ON SUCH AND SUCH AS DAY I WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE WAR WITHOUT ACTUALLY SEEING A GERMAN WE HAD LONG RANGE FIGHTS WITH THEM BUT I NEVER ACTUALLY SAW A GERMAN BUT JOHN WHA WHY DID'T YOU KNOW YOU WANTED TO DO YOUR BIT BUT WHY DID YOU NOT JOIN THE ARMY OR THE RAF S NOT INTERESTED IN EITHER A A TRADITIONAL FAMILY A MY FATHER WAS IN THE NAVY SO WAS MY GRANDFATHER AND AN UNCLE MY GRANDFATHER WAS ON BEATIN HIS FLAGSHIP THE LION AT THE BATTLE OF JATLAN ANDHE DIDN'T COME ON DECK FOR THREE DAYS HE WAS IN THE ENGINEERING BRANCH BUT THAT'S THE SERVICE I WANTED TO JOIN SO I DID AND WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF YOUR TRAINING E IT'S RATHER CONFUSED WHEN YOUERE YOUNG AND YOU DON'T ERM TAKE THINGS IN SO EASILY BUT FROM PEMBROKE HOUSE PEMBROKE BARRACKS WE WERE ALL MARCHED DOWN TO THE ER FURTHER DOWN THE YARD WHERE WE GOT FITTED OUT AND AT THAT TIME EVERYONE LESS OF AN OFFICER WAR THE SAME FOURE AND HALFT RIG WITH BELL BOTTOMS THE SCAFF ND AN THE ER HAT SENT UP TO SKAGNESS WITH ANOTHER BUNCH TO BUTTLINGS HOLIDAY CAMP AND THAT BECAME HMS ROYAL ARTHUR AND I WAS TO START ERM TRAINING AS A TELEGRAPHIST SIGNALLER AND I'D BEEN DOING MORSE CODE YU STARTED ON THE MORSE CODE FOR ABOUT A FORTNIGHT THEN SOMEBODY SAID OH THIS LOT HAVEN'T HAD A A COLORTIST THEY'D BETTER HAVE IT MOST OF THEM PASSED BUT TWO OTHERS AND ME WERE ALL STRONGLY COLOUR BLIND SO YOU'RE OUT IF YOU SEND THE WRONG COLOURS WHEN YOU'RE SIGNALLING IT COULD BE A DISASTER SO THAT'S WHEN I WAS TRANSFERRED ONTO MINE SWEEPERS ON THE STEWARDING BRANCH WERE YOU DISAPPOINTED YES NOBODY LIKED BEING ON MINESWEEPERS WE ALL KEPT PUTTING IN FOR TRANSFER TO SOMETHING MORE GLAMOROUS DESTROYERS SUBMARINES MTBS MGBS BUT ALWAYS GOT TURNED DOWN YOU'RE DOING AN IMPORTANT JOB YOU WILL STAY PUT AND THAT WAS IT HOW MANY PEOPLE ON ONE OF THESE MINE SWEEPERS WHAT WAS THE SIN THE BOAT LIKE ER FIVE OFFICERS AND ERM ABOUT ER TWELVE FIFTEEN CREW THAT INCLUDES THE ENGINEERS OR THE STOKERS BRANCH THEY CALL IT SIGNALLING AND R AND THOSE DOING THE ACTUAL MINE DETECTING WHEN WE FIRST STARTED ANDWENT OUT MINE SWEEPING IT WAS EM THREE DAYS ON ONE DAY OFF AND WE HAD TWO SEAMEN STANDING IN THE BOWS WITH RIFLES ONE O THEY SAW A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING BY THEY'D SHOOT AT IT HIT THE HORNS AND BLOW IT UP BUT THAT WAS WHEN THEY ERM STARTED THE MINE SWEEPING CAMPAIGN AND THE GERMANS WHEN THEY DROPPED THEM HAD LONG WEIGHTS ON WIRES SO THEY JUST FLOATED BELOW THE SURFACE TO HIT THE SHIP IF ONE OF THOSE WIRES CAME LOOSE THE MINE WOULD BOB ON THE SURFACE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOKED FOR EACH TIME WE WENT OUT WHEN THE GERMANS OCCUPIED FRANCE THEY OF COURSE GOT RIGHT ON THE COAST LINE AND THEY HAD BIG GUNS ATGRENA AND HE USED TO POP AWAY T US EVERY TIME WE CAME OUT BUT FORTUNATELY WE NEVER GOT HIT THERE WAS ONE OF THEM A AWMUSING ANECDOTE OUR COMMODORE HAD BEEN EM A SENIOR CAPTAIN BEFORE THE WAR AND HE RETIRED OF COURSE HE WAS BROUGHT BACK IN AD MADE COMMODORE OF THE MINE SWEEPING FLEET HE HAD HIS TWELVE MINE SWEEPERS AND WE USED TO AND DO THE SAME THING EVERY DAY TE GERMANS BEING VERY MITICULOUS WOULD COME OUT WA SAY FRIDAYS AND TUESDAYS NOT ONLY THE SAME DAY BUT T THE SAME TIME TO LAY THEIR MINDS AND THEN DASH BACK IN AND WE WENT OUT THE FOLLOWING MORNING EACH TIME TO PICK THEM UP AND THE SKIPPER GOT A BIT FED UP WITH US AND ERM HE TOLD THE CONFERENCE OF HIS CAPTAIN ONE DAY NEXT TIME WE GO SWEEPING RUN YOUR TRAWLS OUT BUT DON'T DROP YOUR WIRES WHICH IS OF COURSE CONTRARY TO ALL NAVAL INSTRUCTIONS HE COULD AVE GOT COURT MARSHAL IF ANYTHING HAPPENED BUT WE WENT THROUGH THE GERMAN MINEFIELD AS THEY'D LAYED IT AND WE GOT AWAY WITH IT SO THE GERMANS CAME OUT AGAIN TO REPLACE THE MINES THEY THOUGHT WE'D PICKED UP AND TEY LOST FOUR OF THEIR OWN BOATS ON THEIR OWN MINES AND I DON'T THINK THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY SPORTING IS THAT DOCUMENTED CUMENTED SOMEWHERE IN THE ADMIRALTY ARCHIVES YEAS ANYTHING A GOOD IDEA HE COULD AVE GOT INTO A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR THAT AND WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE WHAT WERE YOU DOING E WHEN WE WENT OUT I WAS ER DUE TO REPORT WITH SIX OTHER STEWARDS WE REPORTED TO THE FIRST LIEUTENANT BUT DAMAGED CONTROL PARTY IF THE SHIP GOT HIT WE HAD TO CLEAR THE DAMAGE WAY PUT OUT ANY FIRES AND PULL THE WOUNDED INTO THE WAR ROOM WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS WAITING TO DO WHAT HE COULD BUT FORTUNATELY IT NEVER HAPPENED BUT THAT WAS MY OFFICIAL STATION AND WHAT ABOUT BAD WEATHER AND STORMS AND STUFF DID YOU EVER ENCOUNTER ANY DANGERS WHEN YOU HAD WHAT ANY STORMS BAD WEATHER BIG SEAS ELL WE HAD SOME YES BUT ER WE STILL WENT OUT OUJUST PUT ON YOUR SOUTHWEST AND ERM THAT WAS IT YOU HAD SAFETY LINES REED FOR AND AFT SO YOU HOLD ON TO THOSE YOU WOULDN'T GET WASHED OVERBOARD WHAT ABOUT DI YO WAS I WAS IWHAT WAS IT LIKE WATCHING THE PLANES TAKING GOING OVER YOU AND STUFF DID YOU SEE MUCH ACTIVITY IN THE AIR WE WE FORTING WE NEVER GOT ATTACK FROM THE AIR I DON'T THINK THEY THE GERMANS THOUGHT OUR LITTLE BOATS WER WORTH WASTING A BOMB ON THEY WANTED HEM FOR THE CAPITAL CITIES OR THE AIR FIELDS WERE YOU INVOLVED IN D DAY AT ALL YES NOW A WEEK BEFORE D DAY THE BASE WAS SHUT DOWN LIKE AN OYSTER NOOY COULD GO OFF ONO ONE WAS ALLOWED IN FOR SECURITY REASONS OBVIOUSLY YOU COULDN'T GET ANY POST YOU COULDN'T MAKE ANY PHONE CALLS BECAUSE IT WAS COMING UP ALTHOUGH OFFICIALLY WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS BEFORE D DAY ON ADMIRALTY INSTRUCTIONS IF WE'D STARTED NIGHT SWEEPING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DAY SHIFT SO THE GERMANS WERE GETTING USED TO THE IDEA OF US POPPING ALONG THE COAST DURING THE HOURS OF DARKNESS THEY WOULDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT SO THE EARLY MORNING OF D DAY WE WERT OUT AT MIDNIGHT AND WE WERE SWEEPING RIGHT UP TO THE LINE WHERE THE BATTLESHIPS WERE WAITING TO BOMBARD THE COAST WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE STATIONED AND WE SWEPT THAT MOST CAREFULLY AND THEN WE AS THEY STARTED COMING UOUT OF THE DARKNESS FROM TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WAITING AND WE WERE TIED BEHIND THEM THERE WASN'T ANYTHING ELSE FOR US TO DO WE GOT SENT BACK HERE TO THE ISLE OF SHEPPY WHEN THE TROOPS WENT ASHORE WE WERE A BIT ANNOYED BECAUSE WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING AND THEN ERM ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE DAYS LATER A SKIPPER GOT THE ORDERS TO R PATROL THE DUTCH COAST ON THE SCHELTZ AND PICK UP ALL THE MINES WHICH THE GERMANS HAD SEWN LIBERALLY ROUND ALL THE THE COAST THERE SO THAT KEPT US BUSY FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS AND ER WE WERE STATIONED AT A LITTLE TOWN CALLED TERENUSLAN A VERY SMALL PORT BUT THERE WAS ERM ALONG JETTY SO WE COULD MOORE ALONGSIDE THERE AND ER IN THE EVENINGS LATE AFTERNOON YOU GOT SHORE LEAVE UNTIL YOU WERE GOING OFF AGAIN NEXT MORNING AND I' NEVER FORGOTTEN THE THINGS WE SAW WHEN WE WENT ASHORE THE GERMANS HAD GOT OUT IN A HURRY AND THEIR SIGNS WERE EVERYWHERE ON A HOTEL LOUNGE A BEING IN AN OFFICER'S MESS AND THE SIGNS WERE STILL UP AND THE BLEW SOME OF THE BRIDGES OVER THE CANALS AS THEY LEFT AND THE DUTCH FLOODED SOME OF THE DIKES TO STOP THEIR HEAVY TRAFFIC GETTING AWAY AND I REMEMBER ONCE WHE E WENT ASHORE WE ALL CARRIED THE NAVY RAINCOAT DRAPED OVER YOUR ARM FOLDED IN A CERTAIN WAY AND THE OFFICER WATCH KNEW VERY WELL WE HAD THINGS IN THE POCKETS CIGARETTES PACKET OF BISCUITS TINNOF JAM OR WHATEVER WHICH WEAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING OFF THE SHIP AND WE WERE GIVING IT TO THE DUTCH CIVILIANS BECAUSE THEY WERE AS STARVED AS HELL AND LOOKED VERY ILL AND ON THIS OCCASION WE GOT ASHORE AND I SAW A VERY THIN AGGD LOOKING WOMAN COMING UP THE STREET PUSHING A BATTERED PRAM AND SHE GOT TWO LITTLE KIDS IN THERE ABOU THREE OR A BIT LESS I SUPPOSE AND ONE BLANKET COVER THEM AND I DOFFE MY HAT A GOOD DAY AND SHE GAVE ME A SMILE SHE COULDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH AND I COULDN'T SPEAK DUTCH BUT I TOOK OUT WHAT I HAD AND I PUT IT IN HER PRAMYOU SOULD AVE SEEN THE LOOK ON HER FACE SHE MUST AVE THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS COME TWICE S WHAT THEY DIDN'T EAT THEY COULD ALWAYS TRADE FOR SOMETHING ELSE GONE BACK WITH MORE BUT IT WASN'T TO BE AFTER WE GOT RID OF MOST OF THE MINES OFF THE DUTCH COAST WE HAD ERM A WEEK'S LEAVE D U WELL OBVIOUSLY WE WEREN'T COMING BACK HERE FOR IT WOD BE ON THE DUTCH COAST AND ER I AD ANOTHER FELLOW WE GOT ONTO THE MAIN ROAD WHICH WAS THE BRUSSELS ROAD LEADING INTO E BELGIUM AM THUMB LIFTS FROM ARMY LORRIES WHICH ARE ALWAYS GOING UP AND DOWN AND WE GOT INTO ERM ABOUT THREE THREE HOURS NO A BIT LESS INTO BRUGE WHICH IS ONE OF THE WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITIES I'VE SEEN GOT TWO CATHEDRALS AND H OPERA HOUSE AND THE TOWN HALL ROUND FOUR SIDES OF THE MAIN SQUARE ND EONE OF THE HOTELS HHAD BEEN TAKEN OVER AS A NAPI FOR THE TROOPS BED AND BREAKFAST SO WE STAYED THERE AND WE ENJOYED OURSELVES TEN WHEN WE CAME BACK WE GOT ORDERED BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AND WE WERE STILL LOOKING FOR MINES WHICH MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED DETECTION GOING UP AND DOWN BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH URGENCY IN IT ANY MORE AND ERM I DID PUT IN APPLOCATION TO SITOR LEADING STEWARD BUT BEFORE THAT COULD TAKE PLACE MY DISCHARGE PAPERS CAME THROUGH AND THAT WAS IN THE ER EARLY EARLY NINETEEN XFORTY NINETEEN FORTY SIX NINETENINEN FORTY SIX YES AFTER THE WAR YEAH BUT UNLIKE THE ARMY OR THE AIR FORCE WE GOT PLENTY OF NOTICE WHEN IT WAS COMING I KNOW PEOPLE IN THE AIRFORCE AND THEY WERE GIVEN THREE DAYS NOTICE AND THEY WERE OUT BUT IN THE NAVY WE HAD TIME WE YOUERE TOLD YOUE GOT TO BE DEMOBBED IN THREE MONTHS WELL THEY GIVE YOU TIME TO START LOOKING AROUND FOR A CIVILIAN JOB OR SOMEWHERE TO LIVE IF YOURE MARRIED WITH KIDS SO I THINK WE HAD A BETTER DEAL CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS MINE SWEEPING JUST EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WERE DOING AND WHAT HAPPENES TO THESE MINES WELL LOOKED LIKE YARDS FROM THE MAIN MAST STRETCHED OUT EITHER SIDE ABOUT FIFTY FEET AND FROM THESE ARE DEPENDING VERY SHARP CUTTING WIRES WITH WEIGHTS ON THE END AS YOU GO TO THE WATER THE IDEA IS YOUR CUTTING WIRES TO CATCH THE MOORING WIRES FOR A MINE AND CUT IT THE MINE COME TO THE SURFACE AND YOU DISPOSE OF IT HOW MANY MINES WOULD YOU FIND ON A AN AVERAGE DAY ON AVERAGE DAY ERM POSSIBLY A DOZEN POSSIBLY ONLY TWO IT VARIED AND THE DISPOSAL WOULD BE A SHOT WULD IT OR THAT'S WHAT IT STARTED WITH YES THEN THE GERMANS EVENTLE ERM ACOUSTIC MINE WHICH ERM WASN'T MOOR IT WAS JUST DROPPED IN THE CHANNEL HOPEFULLY IN THE PATH OF ONCOMING SHIPS AND IT EMITTED A MAGNETIC FIELD FROM ERM BATTERIES THAT WERE INSIDE AND EVERY SHIP AS IT GOES ALSO MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD AND WHEN THE TWO COLLIDE THE MINE GOES UP SO WE HAD TO HAVE WHAT AS CALLED DGAZING EQUIPMENT A SPECIAL COIL FITTED RIGHT ROUND THE SHIP AND A CURRENT IS PASSED THROUGH THAT ANTI CLOCKWISE AND THAT NULLIFIES THE EFFECT OF THE ELECTRONIC FIELD AND YOU COULD GO OVER MINES YOU'D BE ALRIGHT COULD YOU FIND THOSE MINES WE FOUND THEM YES OUT SOMETIMES THE GERMANS GOT CRAFT AND THEY DROPPED SOME OF THESE MINES AT NIGHT FROM LOW FLYING PLANES AND WE GOT BACK I WASN'T TERE I WAS ON A COUPLE DAYS LEAVE AND I WENT HOME TO MADESTONE BUT ERM I WAS TOLD AS OUR SQUADRON CAME BACK FROM PATROL AND THE LAST SHIP IN SLID INTO ITS PLACE ON THE JETTY AND PROMPTLY BLEW UP BECAUSE THERE WAS A MINE UNDERNEATH BEING DROPED BY A PLANE AND THE SKIPPER OF THIS LAST BOAT AS IT WAS ONLY SIX FEET FROM THE JETTY YOU GOT IT DIG OUTI EQUIPMENT SWITCH IT OFF I THINK THERE WAS TWO SURVIVORS BUT WHO THEY WERE I DON'T KNOW BUT HOW WOULD YOU FIND I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD FIND A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING IN THE WATER YOU CUT IT AND IT FLOATS TO THE STOP HOW DID YOU FIND THESE MAGNETIC MINES WERE THEY ON THE BOTTOM OR HERON ON THE BOTTOM YES HOW WOULD YOU FIND THAT WELL WITH ER LIKE A SONAR DEVICE IT PICKS UP THE RADIATIONS FROM THE MINE AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHERE IT IS TY CAN DROP A DEPTH CHARGE ON IT YOU SET THE DEPTH CHARGE FOR TWENTY FEET OR THIRTY OR WHATEVER IT IS A JUST EM POPPE THEM OVER THE SIDE ON A WY GUN IN HOLLAND WHEN YOU GOT TO HOLLAND YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMORIES OF JUST THE DEVASTATION WHEN THE GERMANS GOT OUT NARR THEY TOOK EVERYONE WITH THEM ALIVE OR DEAD AND BLEW A COUPLE OF BRIDGES AND THEN RETREATED TOWARDS BELGIUM DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE WINNING THE WAR AT THAT STAGE YES THE GREAT DAY HAD COME THE INVASION HAD STARTED AND WE WERE PUSHING INLAND FROM THE BEACHES WE HADN'T BEEN SHOVED BACK OFF AGAIN AND IT WAS STARTING TO DE BITE WHEN YOU WER PULLED OUT OF D DAY D O WERE O WERE YOU ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WAS GOING ON ON D DAY AFTER THE BATTLESHIPS HAD ARRIVED YOU'D COME BACK TO BASE YOU NO WERE YOU AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR THE GUNS GOING ON THE WHEN THE MAIN BROADSIDE STARTED YES I THINK THAT WAS EM QUARTER TO SIX AND EIGHT MILES OF SHIPS ALL OPENED UP AT THE SAME TIME ND WE ALREADY GOT INFORMATION FROM THE UNDERGROUND RESISTANCE WORKERS WHERE THE GERMAN STRONG POINTS WERE ALL ALONG THE CLIFF TOPS HEAVY GUNN IMPLACEMENTS BUNKERS FOR TROOPS AND SO ON AND THEY GOT CONTINUOUS PLASTERING AND THEY HADN'T QUITE FINISHED IT WAS E TWO HOUR BOMBARDMENT AND BOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE IT STOPPED THE BOATS WERE GOING ASHORE WITH THE TROOPS DID YOU HEAR IT WE WERE ON THE MO BEHIND THEM WE HEARD IT ALRIGHT WAS SUCH A DEAFENING CRUSCENDO OF NOISE THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT OU WEREN'T EVEN NEAR IT NO I WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER VE DAY OH THAT WAS AGAIN MARVELOUS I WAS A WAITING DEMOB AND OF COURSE WE GOT RATHER MORE LEAVE ONCE PEACE WAS DECLARED AND I GOT ERM I THINK IT WAS A FOUR DAY PASS TO GO HOME TO MADSTONE AND IT CAME UP ON THE TRAYING TO VICTORIA AND ER THE PLACE WAS JUST ONE SEETHING MASS OF PEOPLE EVERY COLOUR EVERY UNIFORM EVERY THING YOU COULD THINK OF EVERYONE WAS SINGING DANCING LAUGHING WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS ECAUSE THEY LET THE HAIR DOWN AND IN FRONT OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE YOU COULDN'T HAVE GOT A SHOE AWNING THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS STRETTHING BACK DOWN THEM ALL WAITING FOR TE KING AND QUEEN AND WINSTON TO COME ON THE BALCONY AND THE ROAR THAT WENT UP MUST HAVE GONE ON FOR ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES NONSTOP HA OU REFLECT ON YOUR NAVY SERVICE NOW I'M GI'M GLAD I WENT IT MEANS I AND THOUSANS OF OTHERS DON'T HAVE TO READ ABOUT HISTORY WEWERE MAKING IT WE WERE PART OF THAT HISTORY AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF WARE THERE ANY OTHER STORIES YOU WANT TO SHARE I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY NO AS I SAY MINUS FREVIN AS A VERY DULL OCCUPATION ITH OCCASIONAL SHORT PERIODS OF ACTIVITY BUT ER UNLIKE DESTROYERS OR BATTLESHIPS YOU'RE NOT ENGAGED PERMANENTLY WITH WITH THE OPPOSITE NUMBER WERE THERE ANY OCCASIONS WHERE YOU WERE ENGAGED NO WE WERE NEVER ATTACKED BY PLANES AS I SAID AND ER WE DIDN'T SEE ANY GERMAN TROOPS THE ONLY CONTACT WE HAD WAS WHEN THE LONG RANGE GUNS ON THE FRENCH COAST TRIED TO GET US WHILE WE WERE MINE SWEEPING BUT TE THEY DIDN'T
