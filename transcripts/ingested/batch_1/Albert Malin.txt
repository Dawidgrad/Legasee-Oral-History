so when did you see you went back to i went back to barracks and there i was for about two weeks again just normal routine in the barracks getting up in the morning on parade doing a few jobs and then i and then when i went back from my lunch one day to the mess that i was in there was the draft chit for me to report to the seaman's registration office i went down to the office and they gave me travel documents and all the information that i needed all my papers and told me that i had been allocated to hms oxlip flower' class corvette which was berthed at albert docks greenock scotland i went back to the mess and the chappie in charge and the leading seaman in charge said looked at me chit and me details he said son you're going on the death convoys he said you've got to be prepared to die on these' and it frightened me to death and i said i don't even know where greenock is he said when you go out the barracks go to london turn right and keep going until you get to glasgow and ask again and that was all the information that i didn't even know in the navy you don't march about in platoons and groups like some you're an individual so packed my hammock kit bag went down to the gate and a lorry took me to the portsmouth railway station and somebody told me the train to catch and then i asked and asked and found my way to greenock amazing when i got to greenock i got off the train and i walked up the high street dragging me kit bag and me hammock over the shoulder and asked somebody where the dockyard there it is over there the man on the gate to the dockyard i said to him i've come to join hms oxlip he said there it is son over there where ' there and i couldn't believe it this small boat tied up it was raining and miserable and she was rusty dripping with wet the guard rails were all twisted and bent i made my way over there and a sailor who was standing at the gang plank with a big long overcoat on looked me up and down and he said we've been waiting for you i'll get the officer in charge to allocate you to your mess and there i was i joined oxlip and down below through this corridor through all the hanging rain coats and souwesters and things stench of diesel everywhere was ringing wet into this mess right for'ad right at the front of this ship and this little table which held eight about eight of us or ten of us and that's where i was allocated to number one seamen's mess hms oxlip so your first impressions were not of what a beautiful ship what is said no i was rather a little bit taken aback everything was filthy running with water it was pouring with rain and i did feel a little bit miserable but some of the men soon put me to right and told me you know you'll be alright you know and explained all about how to go about things and they were a good team they were great and of course i slept there put my hammock up and i thought well i'll settle down to this however about three or four days later the other half of the ship who had been on leave all came back and suddenly the for'ad mess deck was absolutely crowded and when the night time came ready to sling your hammock of course the hammock position that i'd been using belonged to one of the men who'd been on leave and all the hammock hooks were taken my first week i slept sitting on a bench with me head in me arms on the mess table i had nowhere to put my hammock it was that crowded the ship was crowded because they needed more men for the different armaments on the ship there were ninety two men on the ship ninety two on this small ship when you sailed to iceland then were you ever on action stations was there any incident no and were you sailing alone we were alone and we didn't have any incidents at all on that first leg in fact everything was quite quiet and normal going through the process and i had no fear at the time and at the time i was really enjoying the lookouts the workmanship of the ship and learning things that i had got to do all the time i had one big incident which was exciting i know people talk about the dangers and the horrors of war but there are times which are separate and amazing and one of them was i was in my position of lookout suddenly i saw a bright light in the sky i dropped my binoculars to look at it with my bare eyes first because it didn't seem like an electric light and it grew bigger and bigger and it shot across the sky and it turned blue pink and shimmered and shook and the whole sky was full of colours and i looked up in amazement everything was bright full of colours the ship was all glowing and a few seconds later everything was silent and it shimmered away just died down and one of the officers on the bridge said have you seen that before malin and i said no he said you're looking at the aurora borealis the northern lights he said you'll be seeing a lot of those he said but don't get too excited we don't like them they show up the convoy he said but enjoy them while you can and i've never ever seen such an amazing thing in my life and it went on and on throughout the night absolutely incredible and it's a thing that absolutely stuck in my mind the first time i saw the northern lights it was a reward for having to go to iceland so eventually you meet up with this american convoy and then you're off yes we're off we didn't which convoy was this did you know ra sixty three i'm sure it was ra sixty three i like the name ra sixty three because it was my wife and i our initials ruby and albert it was r a sixty three and also the number i was allocated in the navy was a very lucky number six three three three six nine six nobody could have had a luckier number than that and i thought with a number like that i've got no fear so we met up with the convoy and after a few hours in the daylight we could just see a ship in the distance because being a corvette antisubmarine our job was the outskirts of the convoy we didn't we weren't in amongst the other ships we were skirting the convoy dropping back at times to see if there was any stragglers or anything like that and to keep our eye on the starboard side of the convoy against u boats and enemy aircrafts now we were really on a war footing and the corvette is like a sheep dog really it just goes round and round the convoy ushering ships along or picking up survivors or doing odd jobs round the convoy but as i say we didn't see a lot of the big ships at the time we were way out on the one side of the convoy you mentioned you were on the starboard side yes is that when you doing ra you were on the starboard side and when you did a return leg you were on the inside going across and on the way back you were on the outside yes that's right now we're going to the convoy and we were going and occasionally we'd have action stations the bells would ring and i'd dash down to my action station which was as i said on the depth charges and we would probably drop a depth charge here and there we could hear the ping of the asdic ping ping ping all the time and we took our orders from the bridge they told us what depth the machinery was there what depth how many depth charges to drop and this is what we did whether there was submarines there at the time i don't know we were just told when and how to drop them you mention about just explain the process of priming a depth charge i wouldn't know how to do it what do you do what does it look like the depth charge is like a big oil drum but of course it's steel casing and it's packed with amatol explosives inside the depth charge is a tube and a hollow tube and with a primer to explode the depth charge itself and to operate it on the outside is a sort of brass clock we have a key for each depth charge you put the key in turn the key to the depth required fifty foot seventy foot whatever and then pull the key out put it in your pocket and then wait for the bell to ring from the bridge ring' pull the handle and the depth charge rolls off the back of the ship into the sea now when you've set the charge you've opened an aperture on the tube and the seawater flows in at a certain speed if it's a near surface depth charge the aperture is larger so the sea gets in quicker once the tube is full of seawater the pressure sets off the primer which explodes the depth charge bang and away she goes this was all explained to me by a smudger while we're there telling me how they are and they roll off by their own weight but on each side of the ship port and starboard side of the ship there are other depth charges which are flung out from the ship by what they used to call the y gun and it's like that because it's shaped like a letter y with a depth charge on the top full of explosive which blew the depth charge way out into the sea on the side of the ship so you could drop them either from the rear manually or throw them out from the sides of the ship we don't see u boats they see you it's a secret war it's not like looking the enemy in the eye it wasn't like the air raids in birmingham where we could see the aircraft and see them dropping them everything is secretive and stealth we're listening they're listening and we're wondering where they are and they're following us and they've probably seen us and so really you just don't know what's happening i did think a couple of times when the depth charges had been dropped of the men down below i really did even though they were germans i thought what a terrible place to be in a big tin can down below under there people dropping explosives on top of you but it didn't frighten me or worry me i just i took it as matter of fact the other thing is as far as action stations were concerned if we were attacked by aircraft i had a different action station and that was down in the depths of the ship loading the shells onto a conveyor to go up to the for'ad to the guns on the upper deck and i didn't like that i always thought to myself i don't mind any action we go through whatever we do so long as i'm in the open and on the upper deck i didn't like being down below during action stations obviously u boats were one threat and then you had the stukas diving at you that's right on the journey east did you ever see any yes we were we knew we were observed we had aircraft we had german aircraft circling the convoy out of reach of the anti aircraft guns and we knew that they knew where we were and the aircraft had very little distance to come because we were going up the coast of norway and round the top of norway and finland and the germans had all the aircraft quite close and they used to take off from norway and harass the convoy with the aircraft but as far as you're concerned you didn't we didn't have a great deal to do because we were so far away from the actual pack of ships we were further out and then as we went further north no need to tell you this about the cold it got colder and colder and we didn't have really a lot of cold weather equipment clothing of sorts and i always thought how strange it was all the time i was on the ship nobody dressed as sailors only the officers would have their hats and their reefer jackets on and uniform but the men wore all sorts of things any old overcoats some even in army overcoats and any old woollen thing anything to keep warm and as we went further and further north it become really bitter cold and the seas become heavy and then by this time i'd recovered from the sea sickness so i was able to go through but strangely enough i found it very exhilarating at the time probably being what seventeen and i found it great you know really exhilarating to be in a storm but the ship being open bridge and just a small ship if we hit a wave it crashed across the focsle bashed up against the bridge poured over the top of us tons of icy cold green water and despite wearing hoods and anoraks over the top of you it seeped through down your neck and run down inside you your boots were full of water and you were absolutely wringing wet and cold so we only did short shifts on the bridge just an hour and then down and we'd sit round the funnel of the ship when we were off look out we'd sit with our backs to the funnel to keep warm you know we could feel the warmth of the engines all the time it was a constant thud thud thud thud the engines all the time except one day it went quiet quiet hello everybody gathered round what's happened up on the upper deck the engine had broken down and i stood on the upper deck there and from the bridge flash flash flash of the aldis lamp sending signals to the convoy we'd broken down and apparently we had the message goodbye oxlip all the best we'll see if we can help you and the convoy sailed away and we were left alone and the skipper gathered us and spoke to us all over the speaker we're in a bit of a fix men we have a break down in the engine room we'll do our best to repair it i want everybody to be as quiet as possible no banging about the noise will be heard underwater by u boats so we've got to take it steady and now and again you could hear a clank or a thump from the engine room as they were trying to repair it and so we were there we were all set up to action stations and i was sitting down between racks of depth charges with smudge and yarning somehow the chef the cook on the ship managed to do some cocoa and we were drinking hot mugs of cocoa all day went past all night and the next day we were still there wallowing about no power no electric no water just swishing about and then suddenly on the horizon a quick flash flash from aldis lamps and racing towards us were two destroyers hms zephyr and hms zealous creaming there way through the seas they came they were an amazing sight three times bigger than we are and the one ship tied up alongside us and the other one circled round and round about a mile distance from us to keep cover from the u boats and they come back with their engineers and parts and their engineer came over on board the ship while they were doing that they refuelled our ship give us some oil a case of oranges some food sandwiches and after a few hours we were okay the ship was finished and zephyr and zealous off they went cheering away all mad all ripe old comments about unreliability of corvettes and away they went and our engines started up again and we made our way back along back to poliarno north russia it was a great adventure that was frightening all the time we didn't know if there was a u boat about we were a sitting duck but we got away with that one most ships work well when they're traversing forwards how was it to be sat in the barents with no power literally rolling what was the movement like what is said well with a corvette they've got no keel they're round bottomed so every slightest movement she rolls and so they roll and they pitch and yaw and it is always constant movement and it's a movement i suppose we get used to indeed when i used to go ashore i was more unsteady ashore for a couple of hours than i was on the ship but in rough seas a corvette was well known for its rolling indeed we had a rough storm once and i was on the bridge lookout and she rolled over so far this one time i could have put my hand out and touched the surface of the sea and she stuck there and i was hanging on like grim death and think my god she's never going to pull herself back again and eventually she'd roll back again and pitched up again and even the experienced men on the ship said they'd never known her roll over so far before she very nearly turned to fortunately we'd got no ice on the upper deck otherwise the weight would have tilted her that bit further but as storms go we had the worst we had terrific storms okay shall i tell you then we finally get to the kola inlet and our ship ties up at a place called poliarno which is a russian submarine base while we are there for a couple of days we managed to get bathed and good food and clean the ship up a bit and tidy up and our sister ship bluebell tied up alongside us and we had the bluebell crew come over and join us on our ship and we had what is known as a sods opera' everybody singing bawdy songs and a tot of rum here and there and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves the russians were very bemused by all this standing watching us and for two days we can relax couple of days there relax and then eventually we'd got to set sail for the return journey what was your recall of the russians what did you see of the russians what was it like to be in northern russia when i got to poliarno and saw the russians the first thing that impressed me was how scruffy they were they did wear long red coats with gold epaulettes on and fur hats and they had rifles with bayonets always fixed they looked swarthy and dark they looked as if they'd never had a wash they were friendly enough but a little bit half afraid to be too friendly probably politics entered it but they never come on the ship and we used to go on the jetty and talk give then little bits of soap or a biscuit sort of thing which they gratefully received and i was a great admirer of them because i realized that stalingrad was going on and leningrad and how they were fighting really hard and i was a great admirer of the russians we're coming out in the bay now what we do all the small ships the corvettes and the frigates line up and make a sweep out to the bay to dropping depth charges here and there to scare off the u boats or to finish off acoustic torpedoes that just go for the noise but on the way on this sweep a u boat surfaced in front of the sweep and one of the other ships i don't know which corvette it was opened fire just a short burst and the men on the uboat all put their hands up in the air and i looked across and it was the first time i had seen a u boat on the surface all black and sleek on the top and they all started jumping off the u boat and trying to swim towards the british ships and the u boat rolled over and sank she'd obviously been damaged by depth charges before we began the sweep and i do know now that out of the forty eight men only one of them survived all the others died of the cold what was it like seeing a u boat i was quite thrilled really and it seemed unreal the u boat standing there just for a few moments and nobody on our ship seemed to take any notice no body cheered or shouted as you see in films or anything like that we just carried on plodding our way dropping an occasional depth charge and it was an event that went on and was finished the one survivor whose name was herbert klockner and i know that now because he wrote a letter to me years and years after the war when you see all these people in the water i mean how far away are you oh we were about half a mile away and we keep to our station and no body races towards them everybody keeps to their station had a if i suppose if one of the other boats had took up speed and raced to them they could have saved a few but they got their orders to do and they stayed station they can't move this is a rule of war at sea it's sad but it's the proper thing to do so once you've done this sweep you're out into the sea what is said once we'd done the sweep we split in two one half goes left and the other right and then the merchant ships which are gathered up in the kola bay behind us steam their way out as fast as they can and form up into convoys lines and while they are doing this we carry on moving all around them hoping to push the u boats further away from the convoy or to sink them and you were when is the bluebell hit in relation to this period of time now then we gather the convoy together and were under way and we were and everything was apparently quite quiet we were still at action stations when suddenly we could hear occasionally depth charges in the distance and then suddenly bluebell was struck by a torpedo she blew up instantly she didn't hole and sink gradually she blew up completely and one man survived all the other men ninety one men all died how far was bluebell from you at this point at this point we were about two or three miles away you saw the explosion yes i heard it and saw it in the distance the officer in charge on the bridge leaned over and said keep a sharp look out bluebell's gone just those few words bluebell's gone it didn't seem right nobody talked about it afterwards i didn't hear anybody passing any remarks or anything but when we got back to greenock her berth was empty it was so sad you'd had that party with them a few days before we'd had a jolly good party with all the men the night before this was on the seventeenth february nineteen forty five and it was about three thirty in the afternoon it's imprinted on my mind i think of them every day every day this is very much the beginning of the return leg isn't it yes and it wasn't a straight forward run back no on the way back we were harassed again by bombers and u boats from the norwegian coast and indeed we lost quite a number of ships sylla hms sylla and there were merchant ships i'm not sure exactly i think we lost three or four huge american ships when you were seeing all of this going on around you was there any time when the stukas came to oxlip not us personally not us individually probably because we were so far away from the actually convoy they were after the merchant ships and also we were so tiny they probably didn't think it was worth wasting their time on us or perhaps the germans hadn't got the confidence of being able to hit us from a distance we were that small they were after the bigger ships but they were very often driven off they wasn't always successful they were driven off with anti aircraft fire any way and we had a carrier with us which carrier do you know i don't know but i do know that it was used in the festival of britain that the carrier that was with us was used in the festival of britain i don't know the name i've forgotten the name are there any other moments on that return leg we did have our scares from u boats attacking but they didn't actually attack oxlip until we were well away from the russian area we couldn't relax somehow or other i did feel that after about three or four days we were out of reach of these u boats and it seemed it was an uneventful journey then back until we saw the huge rock ailsa craig the entrance of the clyde and we knew then we were home and a sad home coming because we'd lost all our friends did you get treated specially having completed you were with seaman who had completed done more than one or two convoys once you'd done one a return leg are you treated any differently by your fellow sailors well you're a veteran you know it was a sort of brotherhood particularly amongst arctic convoy sailors but not but no we had no special treatment we did at in nineteen forty five at the end of the war we were given a speech everybody was a shore in a big hanger and we was given a speech by a politician who said i remember telling us that all you men are hero's and you're going back to barracks and you will all be given ships and allocated to places which were far better than you've already done well he would say that there couldn't be anywhere worse could there so everybody cheered him for his comments and that but we had no special treatment other than that we were the same as everybody else did you do another convoy i did three convoys altogether yes three convoys what was it about the other convoys then they were more or less ditto ditto the same routine the hardest part was the kola going in and out to poliarno and really and truly the first one was the most impressive especially with the loss of bluebell and at the end of the war actually on ve day may eighth nineteen forty five that was the exact day that we got back to greenock we tied up on that day churchill was giving his speech as i was dressed up in my little sailor suit with me little suit case ready to go on seven days leave what was the party like i went ashore and made me way to glasgow and st george's square glasgow was a huge writhing mass and i was kissed ten million times till i caught the train at ten o'clock at night back to birmingham
