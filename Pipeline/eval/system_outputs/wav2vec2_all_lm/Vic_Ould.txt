WAS BORN IN LONDON A CITY ROAD HOSPITAL NINETEEN TWENTY SIX ERM MY MOTHER TOLD ME THE SNOW WAS UP TO THE WINDOW SILL I HOPE SHE MEANT THAT THIS WAS ON THE GROUND FLOOR WITHIN A FEW DAYS I WAS A POORLY BABY I WENT DOWN WITH DOUBLE NEUMONIA WHICH WAS ONE OF THE CHILD KILLERS OF THOSE YEARS AND THEREFORE I WAS ON OPEN ORDER HE MEANT THAT EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY CHECKED YOU JUST TO SEE IF YOU WERE STILL ALIVE AND ANY OF YOUR RELATIONS COULD COME IN AT ANY TIME TO ERM A MYSELF AND MY MOTHER OF COURSE IN THE BED BY THE SIDE OF ME WAS STILL GOING ALRIGHT I WAS BAPTISED IN THE HOSPITAL CHAPEL AND FORTUNATELY I MANAGED TO OVERCOME THAT PROBLEM WHY DID YOU WANT TO JOIN THE NAVY AND WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND THERE I THINK REALLY IN THOSE DAYS AND IT'S DIFFICULT TO EM FOR PEOPLE TO SORT OF ENVISAGE IS NOW A WAR WAS ON EM WITH PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF YOU WANTED TO FIGHT BACK IT IS LIKE A BURGLAR TRYING TO BREAK INTO YOUR DIRE NORMALLY YOU'LL TRY AND STOP HIM AND I WAS DOING A CERTAIN AMOUNT WITH THE ARP I REALLY WANTED TO GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER SO I THOUGHT ABOUT IT I THOUGHT WELL I'LL TRY AND GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INVOLVED SO I WENT TO THE LOCAL DRILL HALL WHERE THEY USUALLY TAKE VOLUNTEERS FOR ANY OF THE THREE SERVICES THIS IS THE ONE IN EM EDGWARE DINSBROOKE ROAD AND VOLUNTEERED FOR THE NAVY I CAME ALONG TO PASS ALL THE TESTS I THINK THERE A LITTLE A FEW WEEKS LATER AND THEY THEY ACCEPTED ME AND SAID A LETTER WOULD FOLLOW BUT THEY COULDN'T TAKE ME AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WAS ONLY SEVENTEEN THEY SAID THEY'D TAKE ME AT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF PROVIDING THE ER THE JOB I WAS GOING TO DO IN THE NAVY TOOK ABOUT SIX MONTHS SO I'D BE EIGHTEEN AT THE TIME WHEN I COULD GO ON BOARD A SHIP SO WHEN I STARTED WORK ON THE MONDAY AFTER THAT I SAID TO THE FOREMAN WELL I'VE JOINED THE NAVY I'M GOING OH NO NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT WE WANT YOU HERE WE'RE DOING MORE WORK HERE WE CAN STOP YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO JOIN THE NAVY I SAID I'VE MADE UP MY MIND I'M JOINED THE NAVY FORGET IT AND IT'S ANOTHER BIT OF LUCK BECAUSE THAT FIRM WAS WORKING ONE HUNDRED PERCENT WITH ASBESTOS AND AT THE TIME THERE WAS NO PROBLEM OF COURSE I'LL FIND OUT LATER ON NEARLY EVERYBODY IN THAT FIRM THAT I KNEW DIED OF ASBESTOSIS SO THERE MUST HAVE BEEN ANOTHER ONE OF MY LUCKY LUCKY TIMES SO ANYWAY FROM THERE THAT ON MY AGE OF SEVENTEEN AND A HALF A LETTER ARRIVED ERM REPORT TO THE DRILL HALL WHERE YOU JOINED AND YOU'LL BE TAKEN ON FROM THERE TO HMS ROLE ARTHUR SO DULY I TURNED UP THERE WERE A LITTLE CROWD OF US GOT ON A TRUCK I THINK IT WAS TOOK US TO THE LONDON STATION AND LONDON STATION A GROUP OF US WENT UP TO SKEGNESS AND THERE WE ARE HIS ROYAL ARTHUR THERE WE DID ALL JOINING ROUTINE GET A UNIFORM AND BE TOLD LOTS OF THINGS ABOUT THE NAVY LOTS OF HORROR STORIES I'M AFRAID ESPECIALLY TO DO WITH WHAT IS KNOWN NOWADAYS AS WELL I THINK VENEREAL DISEASE IN THAT DAY WHICH WAS RIFE AND SO I WENT ON FROM THERE AFTER I PASSED ALL MY USUAL TESTS UP TO MUSCOTIA WHERE I WENT THROUGH THE EXAM FOR A TELEGRAPHIN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR I WENT DOWN FROM THERE TO RELATE AGAIN AND AT THAT TIME D DAY WAS COMING UP AND THEY HAD QUITE ENOUGH TELEGRAPHIC ALL THAT THEY WANTED THEY SAID WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHANGE OVER TO SOMETHING ELSE I SAID WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED SOMETHING ELSE AND IT'S A YES WELL YOU CAN BECOME AN ABLE SEAMAN AND FROM THERE THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS YOU'RE GOING FOR SO I THOUGHT I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT SO ALTHOUGH I WAS A TELEGRAPHIST BECAUSE I PASSED EXAMS I WENT DOWN FROM THERE TO MISS GANGES GANGES WAS TOUGH YOU CAN'T SAY THAT HARD ENOUGH IT WAS TOUGH AFTER BEING IN SOMEWHERE LIKE ASIA MISCOTIA WHICH IS QUITE EASY YOU IS IT WELL BECAUSE YOU HAD TO BE A NAVAL SEAMAN AND A NAVAL SEAMAN WAS WAS ON IT TURNED OUT WAS A TOUGH JOB FOR ONE THING BECAUSE D DAY WAS COMING UP YOU DID TRAINING TO TO FIGHT ON THE LAND AS WELL AS FIGHT ON THE SEA SO WE WERE GOING IN FOR BAIT PRACTICE THROWING HAND GRENADES AMONGST THE ORDINARY SEAMAN SHIP JOBS AND D DAY HAPPENED WHILE I WAS STILL THERE AND YOU COULD HEAR THE FIGHTING GOING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HARWICH FROM FROM THE LANDINGS AND WE WERE GIVING BLOOD AS MUCH AS WE CAN FOR THE INJURED AND WE WERE TOLD SEVERAL TIMES THAT IF THE FIGHTING GETS ANY WORSE AND IT'S HORRIFIC NOW YOU'LL BE OVER THERE JOINING THEM WHETHER YOU WHETHER YOU'RE FULLY TRAINED OR NOT SO FORTUNATELY FIGHTING THE INJURIES DIDN'T GET TOUGHER THAN THEY WERE SO PASSED OUT AS A ORDINARY SEAMAN AND THEN AFTER THAT I WAS ASKED IF I WANTED TO DO WHAT IT WAS CALLED A SUB RATE TO SUB RATE YOU COULD BE AN ATTIC OPERATOR A GUNNER OR YOU COULD BE A TORPEDO MAN WELL AS I ALREADY CARRIED OUT TRAINING AS A TELEGRAPHIST BEING A RADIO OPERATOR SEEMED ABOUT THE NEXT STEP ANYWAY THAT WAS ANOTHER SHORT COURSE OVER THE ISLE OF MAN THESE STONE FRIGATES THAT YOU'D BEEN THERE WERE ALL STONE FRIGATES ALL THE LAND BASED STONE FRIGATES SO SO FAR I'D NEVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP ONLY LOOKED AT LITTLE WHALERS AND THIS TYPE OF THING WHERE WE DID SAILING LEARN TO SAIL LEARN TO DO ALL THE KNOTS AND EVERYTHING IN GANGES SO ANYWAY BETWEEN THAT WHEN WHEN I HAD FINISHED MY TELEGRAPHS COURSE AND ERM THEY SAID TO ME WELL WE'RE NOT SURE WHETHER WE WANT ENOUGH TELEGRAPHS THEY SAID THERE'S LOTS OF OPTIONS SO I SAID WELL CAN I HAVE THE OPTIONS AND SAID YEAH WELL ONE NICE JOB THAT'S COMING UP NOWADAYS IS A SIGNALMAN ON LANDING CRAFT I SAID THEY SAID WELL YOU'VE DONE ALL THE TRAINING YOU ONLY HAVE TO LEARN TO BE A SIGNALMAN WITH THE FLAG AND SO FORTH BUT I CAME INTO MY HEAD WITH THE VISION OF LANDING CRAFT AND ME STANDING UP AT THE FRONT THERE FLAG WAVING AND THE GERMANS SHOOTING AT THE FLOWING WAVE I SAID NO I'M NO HERO I COME HERE TO DO A JOB NOT HERE SO ANYWAY SO I FINISHED UP AS A RADAR OPERATOR THERE WAS TWO TYPES OF RADAR OPERATORS THERE WAS A RADAR LOT AND THERE WAS RADAR GUNNERY CONTROL WELL AS I CARRIED OUT GUNNERY IN GANGES ON MID GUNS THEY HAD SIX INCH HEAVY GUNS THERE THAT YOU TRAINED ON I OPTED FOR THE RADAR CONTROL GUNNERY SO I DID THAT CAUSE AND FROM THERE I WENT DOWN TO ERM CHATHAM WHICH WAS MY BASE ANYWAY I CHATHAM RATING AND WAITED THERE FOR A SHIP WHAT YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE SHIP ALL YOU DO IS WALK ABOUT THE BARRACKS HAVE JOBS LIKE PAINTING COAL WHITE OR SWEEP AND UP ALL DIFFERENT PLACES AND YOU GO DOWN EVERY EVENING IN YOUR OWN TIME TO WHAT I BELIEVE IS CALLED THE OLD BIG BARN AND THEY HAVE LISTS OF PEOPLE TO GO ON DRAFT FOR A SHIP WELL THE FIRST ONE I CAME ACROSS OF GOING DOWN THERE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS I HAD MY NAME ON THERE WAS QUITE A LOT ON THIS DRAFT SO WE HAD TO GO FOR SOME REASON TO HAVE A MEDICAL EVERYBODY HAD TO PASS THROUGH MEDICAL THAT WAS ON THAT DRAFT WHERE IT WAS WHAT IT WAS FOR THEY NEVER TELL YOU THEY NEVER TELL YOU INTO THE NAVY IS KNOWN AS THE SILENT SERVICE THEY NEVER TOLD ANYTHING SO ANYWAY I WENT THROUGH THIS MEDICAL EXAMINATION AS IT CAME TO MY TURN TO SEE THE MEDICAL OFFICER HE SAID OUT WHAT OUT SO I STAND OUT ON ONE SIDE I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL SOME TIME HE CAME ACROSS AND I SAID WHAT'S WRONG I FEEL ALRIGHT HE SAID YOU'VE GOT GERMAN MEASLES WELL MY GOODNESS GERMAN MEASLES AND YOU'RE FIGHTING THE GERMANS SAID I'M NOT HAVING BEEN ANYWHERE NEAR GERMANY HE SAID DON'T BE FUNNY I DOUBT I SPENT A FEW WEEKS IN SAY I'VE GOT NO MEMORY AT ALL OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE I DON'T THINK ANYTHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED BUT IF YOU'RE GOING ON THE DRAFT AND THE GUN ON THE SHIP OBVIOUSLY TWO HUNDRED MEN UPWARD ON THE SHIP YOU COULD PASS IT ON SO A FEW WEEKS TIME SO MY NAME WAS ANOTHER DRAFT AND THIS WAS FOR HIS KARAN AND WE WERE NOT TOLD WE JUST TOLD WE WERE GOING ON A DRAFT AND YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF A DRAFT SO WHEN THE TIME CAME THERE WAS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED OF US FROM CHATHAM WE WERE PUT ON NAVY TRUCKS OPEN BACK WELL OVER BACK OPEN BACK AT COVERED TRUCK TAKEN DOWN TO THE LONDON STATION I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IT WAS NOW BUT ALL OF US ON ONE TRAIN I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY OTHER AS ANY OTHER PEOPLE ON THAT TRAIN EVERYONE UNDER THE DOORS WERE LOCKED WE WERE LOCKED IN AND YOUNG LAD BY THE SIDE OF ME SAID NO THAT'S FOR I SAID YEAH STOP US GETTING OUT IS NOT STOPPED THE GIRLS GETTING TO US WHEN YOU GET TO A STATION THAT STARTED THE CHAT WE GOT FRIENDLY NONE OF US EVER KNEW EACH OTHER WE COME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE ANYWAY THAT WAS A LONG TRIP UP TO GLASGOW GLASGOW WE STOPPED QUITE A FEW TIMES I THINK FOR AIR RAGE AND FOR NO REASON I BELIEVE WE STOPPED AT CARLISLE AND THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED THE CARRIAGES LOVELY CUPS OF TEA AND SANDWICHES PASSED ACROSS FROM THE V S OR WHOEVER NOW ANYWAY AFTER A LITTLE REST ON STARTED THE TRAIN AGAIN AS WE DREW OUT THE STATION I REMEMBER THERE WAS BIG FACTORY BY THE SIDE OF THE STATION RIGHT ON A TRACK AN OLD MILL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND OUT OF THESE WINDOWS THERE WAS BALLOONS AND GIRLS WAVING THE BALLOONS WERE NOT SOME OF THE BALLOONS I CAN REMEMBER I THINK THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OF ANOTHER TYPE WHICH I WON'T MENTION BUT ANYWAY THAT WAS NICE WE LOVED THAT THE FACT OF BEING YOU KNOW CHEERED ON OUR WAY WE EVENTUALLY ARRIVED IN GLASGOW AND THE TRAIN CHANGED STRAIGHT AWAY OVER TO MUST HAVE BEEN A LOCAL TRAIN THAT TRAIN TOOK US TO GREENOCK GREENOUGH WAS OUR DESTINATION AND WE WERE THEN PUT INTO IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE Y M C A A BIG BUILDING AND WE WERE THEN TOLD THAT WE WERE DUE TO HAVE SHIPS COMPANY OF A BRAND NEW SHIP BEING BUILT IN THE SHIPYARD WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO HAVE A REALLY NOW IT WASN'T READY WE COULD GO AND LOOK OVER THE SHIP ANY TIME WE LIKED A MASS OF WIRES AND PEOPLE WELLED IN EM AND I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT WE DID WE MUST HAVE WALKED ABOUT GREENOCK ANYWAY IN A FEW WEEKS THE SHIP WAS READY ALL THE OLD WIRES AND BITS AND PIECES HAD BEEN REMOVED AND WE WERE GIVEN OUR PLACES I WAS ON THE FOREHEAD MESS DECK WE WERE POINTED OUT WHERE WE HAD OUR LOCKER WHERE WE PUT NEW CLOTHES WERE IN UNIFORM NOW OF COURSE ALL OUR CIVILIAN CLOTHES HAD GONE SO WE JUST HAD A NAVAL CLOTHES THE FIRST THING WE HAD TO DO GO THROUGH AS THE TRIALS WERE TAKEN UP THE CLYDE YOU HAD TO DO THIS SPEED WHATEVER DETERMINED AND A FEW GUNNERY TRIALED ANYWAY WHEN WHEN WE FINISHED THE TRIALS AND THE SHIP WAS COMMISSIONED THEN INTO THE ROYAL NAVY AND THAT WAS THE TIME WE WERE GOING TO BE OFF NONE OF US HAD EVER WAS TOLD THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO ON A CERTAIN DAY SO IF WE HAPPENED TO BE HAVING SHORE LEAVE WE COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY BUT THEN ONE DARK NIGHT SHORTLY AFTER WE FINISHED OUR TRIALS WE SLIPPED FROM THE DOCK DOCKSIDE THE ERM OF THE ERM THE YARD THE OTHER YARD AND EDGED OUR WAY UP THROUGH THE CLYDE NO LIGHTS OF COURSE WE CLOSED ALL THE WATER TIGHT DOORS ALL THE SCUTTLES ALL THE DEAD LIGHTS AND WE WERE GIVEN OUR POSITIONS THAT WE WERE ON WATCH THEN WE WERE REAL SAILORS THEN SO I WAS STARBOARD WATCH SO THEREFORE I WOULD BE UP ON THE HALF AN HOUR ON THE STARBOARD LOOKOUT WE WE NEVER HAD ANY ACTUAL TRAINING FOR THIS IF WE JUST WERE TOLD TO DO WHAT WE WERE TOLD SO ANYWAY WE EASED OUT OF THE CLYDE YOU HAVE TO GO PAST THE BOOM WHICH LET YOU OUT THE TIDE CLYDE AND I REMEMBER I CAME OFF WATCH OR I HADN'T GONE ON WATCH I CAN'T REMEMBER AT THIS STAGE BUT I HAD REASON TO GO TO THE HEDGE WHICH THE TOILETS I SIT DOWN JUST SITTING DOWN AND THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION A BANG OR RATTLED PULLED MY TROUSERS UP QUICKLY RUSHED OUT OF THE DOOR INTO THE WHAT THEY CALLED THE CANTEEN FLAT THAT'S JUST A PASSAGEWAY AND BUMPED INTO ONE OF THE OTHER SAILORS WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERIENCE THAN ME I SAID HAVE YOU BEEN TORPEDOED ON OUR FIRST NIGHT OUT NO IT'S ONLY THE TORPEDO AND TRYING TO DEPTH JADED OUT BUT SHAME FACED I DIDN'T GO BACK HE SAID WELL YOU WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE THERE ANYWAY SO WE HAD A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT THAT ANYWAY FROM THERE AS I SAY IT WAS A DARK NIGHT WHY WAS IT ALL ERM SO CLANDESTINE WHEN YOU LEFT WELL THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THE ENEMY ERM KNEW THAT THERE WAS SHIPS BEING BUILT NEARLY ALL THE TIME AND THEY WOULD COME OUT OF THE CLYDE OR COME OUT OF THE TIME OR PERHAPS COME OUT OF IRELAND AND IF YOU CAN VISUALIZE IRELAND AND SCOTLAND AND THERE IT NARROWS IT'S REALLY WIDE IT'S A LONG DISTANCE BUT IT NARROWS AS AS A CONTINENT AND THEREFORE SHIPS HAD TO COME IN AND OUT OF THAT AREA WELL THIS WAS ALWAYS THE PLACE WHERE YOU'D HAVE TWO OR THREE U BOATS JUST LURKING HOPING FOR A GOOD KILL AND WHETHER THEY WERE EVER FOUND OUT THAT A SHIP FROM ANY SPIES OR ANYTHING WAS COMING OUT AT THAT TIME I HAD NO IDEA BUT THAT WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS PART NONE OF US HAD WORKED TOGETHER WE'D ALL COME OUT OF TRAINING WE HAD GOOD TRAINING IN OUR OWN JOBS BUT OF COURSE NOT DETAIN BECAUSE WE WERE NOT WITH THE SAME PEOPLE WE WERE TRAINING WITH SO FROM THERE ONWARDS YOU WERE UP FOR HEADS IT WAS REALLY THE THE FEW SAILORS THAT EXPERIENCE AND THE OFFICERS OF COURSE WHO WERE EXPERIENCED HE HAD TO HAVE ALL THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO DO WHAT YOU WERE DOING BECAUSE YOU'D GET NO ESCORT YOUR SHIP COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN WITH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CREW THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TO SEA BEFORE NEVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP BEFORE VERY OFTEN SO IF WE'D BEEN ATTACKED AT THAT TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SITTING DUCK WHEN WE ARRIVED AT SCAPA FLOW WHICH IS RELATIVELY SAFE WE GO THROUGH THE BOOM AGAIN TO GET INTO THE FLOW AND FROM THEN ONWARDS YOU DO OUR TRAINING THE TRAINING AT SCAPA FLOW REALLY IS TO GET YOU WORKING AS A TEAM THE WHOLE SHIP HAS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING A GUN CREW FOUR OR FIVE HAD TO KNOW HOW TO WORK TOGETHER IF YOU WERE IN THE ER TRANSMITTING STATION WHICH IS THE ONE OF THE NERVE CENTRES LIKE WE WERE GUNNERY CONTROL YOU WOULD HAVE ABOUT TEN PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM IT IS ONLY THE SIZE OF AN ORDINARY SITTING ROOM AND EACH ONE OF THOSE HAD A JOB TO DO BECAUSE ON A DESTROYER WHICH WE WERE WAS A DESTROYER A BRAND NEW RUN AS WELL SO NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO WE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE FIRE CONTROL TABLE AS IT WAS WHERE YOU GOT EIGHT PEOPLE ON IT AND ALL THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THEY ARE TRAINED ON SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THE TRAINING THEY STILL HAD TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT IF THE SHIPS ATTACKED OR IF WE SHOULD ATTACK ANOTHER SHIP SO THAT WAS WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF US IN THE FLOW AT THAT TIME WE WERE SO SHORT OF DESTROYERS IN PARTICULAR AND OTHER ESCORT SHIPS SO NOT ONLY WERE WE STAYING IN AN ICE SAFE AREA TO DO OUR TRAINING WE WERE SENT OUT IN HARNESS AS IT WAS CALLED WITH ANOTHER SHIP THAT MIGHT BE MORE EXPERIENCE BUT THEN OF COURSE THERE'S ONLY ONE OF YOU THAT EXPERIENCE AND ONE WHICH IS TRAINING WHICH IS US SO UM WE LEARNT IT THE HARD WAY ALL OUR REAL FIGHTING WAS AROUND THAT TIME AT THE END OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH WAS ERM ER OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER WAS AROUND THAT AREA SO THEY'D SEND US OUT WITH ANOTHER SHIP AND THIS IS IN ONE CASE WE WERE THE ONLY SHIPS THAT WERE IN THE FLOW DESTROYERS AND WE WERE OF COURSE DUTY DESTROYER AND MS BULLEN WHICH WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AT THAT TIME WAS A SHIP THAT SUNK SO WE WERE SENT OUT WITH NO NO NO BASIC TRAINING ON THIS WE HAD A CALL TO GO TO A SHIP OFF CAPE ROT THAT HAD BEEN SUNK DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD BEEN TORPEDOED HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY OUR MESSAGE WAS NOT THAT IT HAD BEEN SUNK THAT A SHIP HAD BEEN TORPEDOED AND TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO GO OUT TO TRY AND HELP TO CATCH THE U BOAT THAT HAD SUNK OUT AND TO PICK UP SURVIVORS IF THERE WERE ANY THERE SO THERE WAS TWO OF US AND IT SEEMED FROM THE RECORDS I LOOKED UP THE OTHER SHIP THAT WENT OUT WITH US WAS ANOTHER SHIP THAT WAS ALSO WORKING OUT SO THESE TWO DESTROYERS WAS ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL HAD TO GO OUT TO THE SHIP I FOUND OUT LATER IN LIFE IT WAS HMS BULLEN WHICH WAS A ESCORT VESSEL AND THEY HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A U BOAT THE VERY U BOAT THEY'D BEEN LOOKING FOR HIT ONE OF OUR SHIPS FIRST SO MS BULLEN HAD HAD BEEN SUNK AND THE OTHER SHIPS THAT WERE WITH US WERE STILL LOOKING FOR THE U BOAT WELL THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS OUR SKIPPER WAS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE VERY EXPERIENCED AND HE WENT TO THE POSITION WHERE THE WHERE THE U BOAT HAD SUNK HMS MS BULLEN NOBODY WAS TOLD ANYTHING HE KNEW IT WAS MISSILE AND NONE OF US WERE TOLD SO THE FIRST THING YOU DO YOU GO AROUND DEPTH CHARGE IN THE WHOLE OF THE AREA IN CASE THE U BOAT IS STILL THERE WELL WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH TOLD OUR ASIA OPERATOR THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DOWN THERE WHICH COULD BE THE U BOAT SO WE DEPTH CHARGE THAT AREA AND APPARENTLY THE ERM ECHO WE DIDN'T MOVE IT STAYED THERE SO WE ASSUMED THAT THAT WAS A U BOAT AND NEVER CAME UP NEVER GOT IN THE OIL NEVER GOT ANYTHING SO AT THAT TIME OF THE WAR THE ERM SNORKEL HAD ONLY JUST STARTED SO WHICH HELPED THEM LATER ON IN THE WAR NOW THIS U BOAT IF IT DIDN'T COME UP WITHIN TWELVE HOURS THEN IT WAS A DEAD DUCK SO WE WAITED AROUND THERE ALL NIGHT WITH A BOARDING PARTY READY TO GO ON TO THE U BOAT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME UP FOR IF IT HADN'T BEEN AND THEN IT SEEMED WE HAD TO GO ON ANOTHER JOB I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE WE HAD TO GO ON AN ESCORT JOB SO WE STOOD DOWN THE WHOLE TEAM I WAS LOOKING THIS IS THE NEXT MORNING WE STOOD DOWN THE TEAM OF THE BOARDING PARTY AND I WAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE OF THE SHIP I HAD NO WORK TO DO I WAS OFF WATCH AND I COULD SEE IN THE NEAR DISTANCE A MAGNETIC MINE FLOAT PAST BUT NOBODY SHOT AT IT WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE ONE USUALLY JUST IN CASE THERE WAS A NEW BOAT DOWN HE WOULD KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL THERE WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE ALL NIGHT YOU NEVER STARTED YOUR ENGINES BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT U BOAT IF YOU WERE STILL ALIVE THEN DOWN THERE TO KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL UP THERE WAITING SO IN THE END WE WENT BACK TO SCAPAFLO AND CARRIED ON WITH OUR LEARNING TO FIGHT A WAR TELL ME ABOUT CHRISTMAS IN SCAPA WELL ERM THIS WAS THIS I TOLD YOU ABOUT WAS THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER OR THE SMALL JOBS WE MIGHT HAVE DONE THERE I'M NOT SURE BUT THE NEXT IMPORTANT THING I CAN REMEMBER IS THAT WE WERE ERM NOT REQUIRED FOR WORK AROUND THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD SO WE WERE BACK IN SCAPA FLOW AND IT WAS QUIET AND WE WERE SAFE BUT NONE OF US HAD HAD A CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME BEFORE THIS AND THERE WE ALL WERE IN A DEAD PLACE SCAPA FLOW WAS A TERRIBLE PLACE BETTER THAN ANYTHING AND WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS THERE WAS TWO HUNDRED ON THE SHIP ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED SHIPS COMPLIMENT AND LUCKILY WE HAD A FEW AMONGST US THAT WE EXPERIENCED AND THERE WE WERE COOKS AND THE MESS WERE MAKING CHRISTMAS CAKES WITH WHATEVER STUFF WE COULD GET HOLD OF YOU ALSO MANAGED TO GET I'M NOT SURE WHERE FROM A CHRISTMAS TREE FOR SOMEWHERE AND THAT IS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE MAST ON THE TOP OF EVERY SHIP AT CHRISTMAS TIME IF THEY'RE IN HARBOUR THEY HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE WHICH HAS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE SHIP AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED I THINK BY THE OFFICERS BEING CHRISTMAS BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER YOU WERE OR NOT AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A DRINK ON BOARD IT'S A DRY SHIP AT SOME OF THE OLD STAGES HAD SAVED SOME OF THEIR RUM RATION WHICH YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO BECAUSE THE VERY VERY HIGH CHARGE IF YOU WERE CAUGHT BUT THE OFFICERS NORMALLY ON A SMALL SHIP LIKE A DESTROYER CLOSED THEIR EYES TO LOTS OF THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO IF THEY WERE ON A BIG SHIP THAT WE CALL A PASSER SHIP SO MANY OF THE LADS THAT WERE ALLOWED TO RUN I WASN'T BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO RUN UNTIL YOU WERE TWENTY AND I WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN BUT OUT CAME THE RUM RUSSIAN HORRIBLE I HATE IT AND ERM PEOPLE MADE UP THINGS OUT OF PAPER I THINK SOME PACKAGE IN PAPER RED GREEN AND BLUE CAME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES OUT OF HIDE HOLD AND MADE INTO DECORATIONS AND WE WERE MOORED AT A BOY THERE AT THE TIME AND SINGING CHRISTMAS SONGS SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAD INSTRUMENTS WE HAD A SMALL BAND ON BOARD AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE I SUPPOSE SOME OF OUR LADS WHO COME FROM HOMES THAT NEVER HAD IT BAD I THINK IT WAS VERY CHEERFUL FOR THEM I CAME FROM A HOME THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY SO CHRISTMAS WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FOR ME SO ANYWAY WE ALL ENJOYED OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME AND IN PLACE LIKE SCAPA FLOW SO THAT'S QUITE GOOD COMMANDER WILKINSON WAS OUR CAPTAIN AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A LIFE FOR HIM REALLY AFTER WE'D BEEN WITH HIM FOR A TIME BECAUSE ALTHOUGH HE WAS VERY STRICT HE WAS QUITE HAPPY TO TURN HIS LIFE HE WAS A LAD THE SAME WITH US LATER ON IN THE STORY WHEN WE GOT UP FAR EAST EM I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT BUT HE WE HAD MULTI POLO TEAMS AND HE WAS ON THE TEAM WITH THE LADS AGAINST THE OFFICERS AND THAT WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON HE WOULD BE AND HE WAS I THINK BOXING CHAMPION OF THE FLEET OR PART OF THE FLEET AND HE WAS SUCH A NICE PERSON YOU KNOW AND THERE IS ANOTHER CASE I'LL TAKE IT TELL YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE WHEN I GO ASHORE SO BUT THE NEXT THING WE WE WENT ON REALLY AFTER CHRISTMAS AFTER CHRISTMAS WAS WHEN WE REALLY STARTED LEARNING THAT THERE WAS A WAR ON WE WOULD STILL GO OUT AND WOULD STILL GO OUT AS A SHIP WORKING UP TOGETHER BUT THE FIRST ONE WHEN WE WENT OUT WITH I BELIEVE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND THIS WAS TO BE A STRIKE AGAINST NORWAY WE DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL WE WERE AT SEA WE WERE DOING THIS BUT THERE WAS THESE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS SOME MORE DESTROYERS I THINK AND SOME OTHER SHIPS NOW OUR AIR JOB WAS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT THE M ONE OF THE CARRIERS BUT IT WAS ALSO TO ACT AS A LIFEBOAT REALLY WHEN THE AIRCRAFT TOOK OFF AND I THINK A COUPLE OF THESE WERE OLD TYPE AIRCRAFT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF BUT THEY WERE BY PLANES NOW THIS WAS A REALLY ROUGH DAY AND THEY TOOK OFF I WATCHED THEM I WASN'T ON WATCH ALL THE TIME AND I WATCHED THEM FROM THE DECK AND THE CARRIER WAS BALANCING UP AND DOWN BUT THEY TOOK OFF AND I THINK THEY CARRIED OUT OR TRIED TO CARRY OUT THEIR TASK BUT THE TWO I SAY COME BACK DIDN'T MAKE IT BECAUSE THEY THE SHIP WAS DANCING UP AND DOWN THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER DANCING UP AND DOWN AND I BELIEVE ONE OF THEM HIT THE DECK WAS PUSHED OVERBOARD THAT'S WITH THE PEOPLE IN IT THEY CAN'T TAKE THEM OUT PUSHED THEM OVERBOARD TO MAKE WAY FOR ANOTHER ONE LANDING AND THE OTHER ONE DISAPPEARED I THINK HE WAS GIVEN ORDERS TO TRY AND FLY BACK TO HIS BASE OR A BASE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH TO LAND ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER WE I THINK IT BEING A CRASH BOAT THAT WAS CALLED WE WENT TO TRY AND FIND THE AIRCRAFT THAT HAD DITCHED SADLY NO AIRCRAFT SO ANYWAY I THINK THEY HAD TO CALL OFF THE STRIKE BECAUSE IT WAS JUST TOO TOO DANGEROUS TO DO ANY MORE FLYING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO THAT WAS REALLY A BAD BEGINNING TO MY WAR WE WENT BACK TO SCARPA TALK ABOUT IT BEING ROUGH HOW ARE YOUR SEA LEGS TERRIBLE I WAS SEASICK MOST TIMES I WENT TO SEA BUT WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE ON LOOKOUT OR WHEN YOU'RE IN THE TS WHICH IS IN CAMP THE TS IS DOWN BELOW AND THAT IS THE TRANSMITTING STATION THAT TAKES THE THAT'S LIKE A RELAY FROM THE DIRECTOR TOWER WHICH IS RIGHT UP THE TOP OF THE SHIP THROUGH YOU IN A T S TO THE MAIN ARMAMENT WHICH IS FOUR FOUR INCH GUNS SO I WAS THE COMMUNICATION NUMBER SO THE DIRECTOR WOULD SPEAK TO ME THE OFFICER TWO OFFICERS IN THE DIRECTOR WOULD BE SPEAKING TO ME AND I WOULD BE SPEAKING TO THE GUNS BUT APART FROM THAT THE DIRECTOR WOULD HAD INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD SEND SIGNALS DOWN TO OUR BIG COMPUTER THE ORIGINAL MECHANICAL COMPUTER THE MECHANICAL COMPUTER WOULD SEND THAT INFORMATION MECHANICALLY TO THE GUNS BUT ONCE I GOT INTO A POSITION WHERE THERE WAS EXCITEMENT I FORGOT ALL ABOUT SEA SICKNESS I WAS OK SO THAT WAS A GOOD THING BUT NORMALLY IF I WASN'T ON ONE WATCH STANDING I'D BE STANDING ON THE UPPER DECK WATCHING THE SEA HEAVING UP AND DOWN AND PROBABLY BEING SICK THE ONLY TIME YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS IS WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING ACTION YOU KNOW LATER ON I TALK ABOUT THE MINE LAYING WE WERE AT ACTION STATIONS ALL THE TIME BUT IF YOU'RE DOING A JOB JUST ESCORTING THEN YOU'RE AT CRUISING STATIONS AND UNTIL SOME TROUBLE POPS UP DEPTH CHARGING U BOATS IS NOT A CASE OF GOING TO ACTION STATIONS IT'S ONLY IF THE U BOAT FIGHTS BACK AND THEN YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS SO ANYWAY WE WENT FROM THERE BACK TO SCAPA FLOW I THINK WE DID ONE OR TWO JOURNEYS LIKE THIS OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND EVENTUALLY EM WE SUPPOSEDLY FINISHED OUR TRAINING OF WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM MIND YOU ALL THIS TIME I'M TALKING TO YOU ABOUT NOW WE WERE STILL LEARNING BECAUSE WE WERE STILL TEAMING UP WITH PEOPLE THAT WE NEVER WORKED WITH BEFORE SO IF WE'D RUN INTO ANY REAL TROUBLE AT THAT TIME WE WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD A LOT OF CHANCE IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER ON WHEN WE HAD LEARNT THESE THINGS SO THE NEXT ONE I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT ONE THIS IS IN ABOUT FEBRUARY I BELIEVE WE WERE JUST TOLD WE WERE GOING OUT I THINK THAT NIGHT WE WERE NOT GIVING ANY REAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE WE WERE GOING OR WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO BUT IT WAS A VERY BIG DO THERE WAS A VERY LARGE FORCE IT WAS WE LEFT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT I BELIEVE IS THIS OUT SCUPPER THIS IS OUT OF SCAPPER AND THIS IS WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE MAIN LINE OPERATION IT WAS A VERY IT WAS ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO MOON IT WAS ALL STARLIGHT SO IT WAS A VERY GOOD VISIBILITY AND IT WAS A VERY CALM NIGHT STRANGELY ENOUGH HARDLY ANY ROUGH SEA OR ANYTHING WE SET OUT AND OF COURSE YOU SELDOM KNOW WHO'S WITH YOU YOU IT'S A SILENT SERVICE YOU'RE NOT TOLD ANYTHING AND WE'D BEEN ABOUT OUT ABOUT AN HOUR I BELIEVE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AND THE SKIPPER THEN SET OVER TO TURN WHAT WAS GOING TO DO IT OPENED HIS ORDERS AND HE TOLD US THAT WE WERE A BIG FORCE ONE OF THE LARGE FORCE WERE GOING DOWN THE SOUTHERN PART OF NORWAY TO EGASUND AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY WE WERE JUST ONE OF TWO SHIPS THE OTHER ONE WAS ZEUS SAME SIDE OF THE SAME DESTROYER AS WE WERE AND OUR MAIN ERM TASK WE HAD TO ESCORT THIS MINE LAYER APOLLO ERM FIRST OF ALL BOTH FORCES WORKING TOGETHER HAD TO PASS THROUGH A BIG MINE FIELD THERE'S A BIG MINE FIELD THAT WAS LAID I THINK BY US ERM AND WE HAD TO GO THROUGH ONE PATH FOR IT WHICH IS THE ONLY PATH THROUGH IT BUT WE KNEW WHERE THE OPENING WAS SO IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE ENOUGH BUT YOU DO GET LOOSE MINES SO OUR AS DEC OPERATOR HAD TO PICK OUT THE MINES THE MAN AND I WAS ON WATCH AT ONE TIME AND I COULD HEAR HIM SAYING THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE PORT SIDE AND THE CAPTAIN WOULD MOVE THE SHIP OVER A BIT SO ANYWAY WE GOT THROUGH THE MINEFIELD ALL OF US HAD NO REAL PROBLEM AND THEN WE SPLIT UP WE WERE TO WAIT UNTIL TWELVE O'CLOCK AND AT THAT TIME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE OTHER BIG FORCE WE WERE BY THE WAY UP THERE DAVE AT THAT POINT AND THE OTHER BIG FORCE WAS TWO CRUISERS I THINK AND NO AIRCRAFT CARRIED AT THAT POINT AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY GERMAN CONVOY THAT WAS GOING TO LEAVE EGASUND AND WAS GOING INTO HUNGER COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO ERM SAVANNA WHERE WE WERE WE THE OTHER FORCE WAS TO STOP THEM GETTING THERE SO DAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK THE THE OTHER FORCE WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE CONVOY AND THEY WERE HOPING IN THAT WHEN THAT STARTED THERE WOULD BE LOTS OF FIREWORKS DOWN FURTHER ALONG THE COAST IT WAS QUITE A FEW HUNDRED MILES BUT THAT WOULD TAKE THE HEAT OFF WHAT WE WERE DOING WE WERE A CLANDESTINE OPERATION THE WE WERE TO ESCORT THE APOLLO TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WAS GOING TO START LAYING MINES DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK AND WE WERE TO BE BETWEEN HER AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND IF SHE WAS SIGHTED ON BY THE GERMANS OR PICKED UP BY RADAR BY THE GERMANS AND THEY WERE TO START FIRING WE WERE TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS WE COULD AND TEAR UP AND DOWN THE BIT OF SEA BETWEEN US AND BETWEEN THE APOLLO AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND USE ALL THE GUNS AND FLARES AND EVERYTHING YOU COULD TO TAKE THE HEAT OFF HER SO THAT ATTACK US ERM SO THE APOLLO WOULD HAVE EITHER FLUSHED US OR INDICATED TO US OR NOT ON THE SHORE BECAUSE YOU COULD GIVE EVERYBODY HAD TO KEEP RADIO SILENCE AND WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO SMOKE SHOW ANYTHING YOU WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO THE BANG BECAUSE THE NOISE WE WERE NOT FAR AWAY FROM THE COAST HOW TO AND BUT THE SHIPS BOTH US AND THE OTHER ESCORT DESTROYED AS ELIAS HAD TO KEEP UP AS MUCH STEAM AS WE COULD BECAUSE IF THE FIREWORKS STARTED WE WERE TO HAVE TO AT FULL SPEED RUSH UP AND DOWN THIS BIT OF COAST FIRING WHATEVER WE COULD PREVENT THEM TO THE APOLLO WELL I COULD HEAR FROM THE GUNS BECAUSE I WAS IN THE ERM ER TS AND FROM THE DIRECTOR AND BEFORE WE STARTED DOING ANYTHING AND I COULD HEAR THE PEOPLE WITH THE GUN SAYING WELL I CAN SEE THE HEADLIGHTS THERE THEY'RE JUST JUST OVER THERE A LITTLE BIT THE CAR COMING DOWN GOING FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT AND I COULD HEAR ALL THIS THEY SAY I HOPE THEY CAN'T SEE US FROM WHERE THEY ARE AND THEN HE SAID RIGHT THEY'VE STARTED DOWN THE OTHER END AND THEY STARTED FIRING DOWN AT THE OTHER END THEY ATTACKED THIS CONVOY AND THEY WERE YOU COULDN'T SEE THE OTHER YOU COULDN'T I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING ANYWAY BECAUSE I WAS DOWN IN THE TS BUT I WAS GETTING ALL THE MESSAGES FROM NOT THE TWO OFFICERS UP IN THE ER DIRECTOR TOWER BUT FROM MY MATES ON A GUN GUN X GUN AND A GUN THEY WERE FUNDING IN ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE MATE THEY LOOK I THINK THAT BLOODY SMOKING OVER THERE YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T SEE US ANYWAY APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO MUCH SO WE WERE SLOWLY CRUISING UP AND DOWN AND THE APOLLO STARTED LOWERING OUR MINES DEAD ON TIME DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK THE THE MINE LAYER IT'S A BIG MINE LAYER CARRIED A LOT OF MINE A BIG CRUISER THEY ARE AND ONCE THEY START LAYING THE MINE AND THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME IN THEY CAN'T STOP THEY'VE GOT TO DO THE WHOLE OF THEIR MINE LAYING BECAUSE THE MINEFIELD IS BEING LAID SO THEY CAN'T TURN BACK THEY COULD ONLY GO ON AND CARRY ON LAYING THEIR MIND SO ANYWAY WE 'RE JUST GOING SLOWLY UP AND DOWN AND AND BECAUSE OUR SHIP WAS KEEPING STEAM UP READY FOR A QUICK DASH UP AND DOWN THE VALVE BLEW SO YOU GOT A NORMAL IS A WELL KNOWN DESTROYER WHOOP WHOOP WHOOP WHOOP WHICH WE DO EVERY TIME YOU COME IN AND OUT OF HARBOUR JUST TO SIGNAL AND APPARENTLY EVERYBODY WENT MAD THE CRUISER WENT MAD THEY WERE IN SILENT ROUTINE YOU KNOW AND THE FACT THAT WE WERE NEVER SUSSED OUT NOT TO THE VERY END AND I THINK IT MIGHT EVEN BE IF ANYBODY HAD HEARD THAT WHOOP WHICH IS A WELL KNOWN BRITISH DESTROYER SIGNALLED TO SAY YOU KNOW I'M COMING INTO HARBOUR OR SOMEWHERE THEY THOUGHT YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T BE A BRITISH DESTROYER NOT BEING AS DAFT ENOUGH TO DO A THING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW SO ANYWAY THEY LAID THEY LAID THE MINES AND THEN WE KNEW I DON'T KNOW BY SIGNAL OR WHAT SHE SAID ALL DONE YOU KNOW WE CARRIED OUT OUR MISSION SEE YOU BACK IN PORT AND I WAS AT THAT TIME LISTENING TO SOME OF THE MINERS AND THEY WERE SAYING LOOK AT HER MOVE AND SHE WAS DOING FORTY KNOTS SHE WAS ONE OF THE FASTEST SHIPS THERE WERE AND THEY COULD SEE THE BOW WAVE MIND IT IS NIGHT BUT IT WAS STARLIGHT AND YOU COULD SEE YOU COULD SEE THE SHORE YOU COULD SEE THE PLACE WHERE THE GUNS WERE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A CRACK AT US AS THEY'D KNOWN AND AWAY WENT THE APOLLO AND AT SPEED AND WE TURNED AROUND BUT WE WE WENT AS FAR AS WE COULD BUT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO AT A GOOD SPEED BECAUSE WE GOT A SIGNAL THAT THE GERMANS HAD SUSSED OUT THAT THEY WERE BEING ATTACKED ESPECIALLY FROM EGASUND WITH THE BATTLE WE HAD ON DOWN NOW AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE AFTERWARDS ON THE APOLLO WHEN I CAPTURED THEM THEY SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD AND THEY WERE IN THE WATER TELEGRAPH OFFICE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT WE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED ALTHOUGH FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BECAUSE THEY HAD PICKED US UP ON RADAR THE FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED AND HE THINKS THAT THE ERM APOLLO WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF COURSE HAD GIVEN THE RIGHT CHALLENGE ANSWER BUT THEN THEY CHALLENGED AGAIN LATER ON AND DIDN'T BECAUSE THE APOLLO HAD STARTED DISAPPEARING SO THEY SENT TORPEDO BOMBERS AFTER US AND THEY NEVER FOUND US SO WE GOT BACK OK SO THE MINE WAS SUCCESSFUL OUR FORCE DOWN FURTHER IN CASA EGAN AND STOPPED THE CONVOY GOING UP THE GERMAN CONVOY THEY HAD SUNK ONE OR TWO OF THE SHIPS AND ONE OR TWO OF OUR SHIPS THAT HAD INJURED PEOPLE BUT THE WHOLE MISSION WAS SUCCESSFUL IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU WERE EXPENDABLE WHEN YOU WERE OUT THERE YEAH WITH THE APPOINTMENT YOU ARE WHY I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A DESTROYER WAS A VALUABLE BIT OF KIT TALK A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF DESTROYER AND IT'S CONFERABLES YEAH BECAUSE WHY SHOULD WHAT I SHALL BRING IN IS BECAUSE LATER ON WHEN TOWARDS THE END OF THE WAR WHICH WON'T BE IN THAT ONE IS WHEN WE WERE A BIG FORCE ESCORTING SOME OF THE CRUISERS OUT TO THE FAR EAST WE ONLY TOOK THEM AS FAR AS GIBRALTAR YOU SEE AND THEN ANOTHER FORCE TAKES OVER BUT WE WERE ESCORTING THE BATTLESHIP THE RENOWN AND WE WERE THE CLOSE ESCORT ONE DESTROYER EACH SIDE FAIRLY CLOSE WHEREAS OTHERS WERE FURTHER OUT AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY LIKE THIS AND I WASN'T ON WATCH I WAS JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE BUT WE WERE QUITE CLOSE BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE ESCORT YOU SEE AND I'M JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE AND OVER THE TANNOY COMES THE VOICE FROM THE CAPTAIN WE'RE NOW REACHING A DANGEROUS AREA AND THERE MIGHT BE U BOATS AROUND IF A U BOAT HAS FIRED A TORPEDO AND THAT IS YOU KNOW AND WHAT WE SEE THAT THE TRACK OF THAT TORPEDO HEADING TOWARDS BIG SISTER WHICH THEY CALLED THE RENOWN THEN WE STOP IT YOU KNOW WHAT WE MEAN YOU STOP IT AND THERE'S ME LOOKING OVER THE SIDE LOOKING AT THE TORPEDO BULGE ON THE RENOWN AND THINKING TO YOURSELF YES YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE TWO HUNDRED MEN JUST A TOP A TORPEDO BENDING THE TORPEDO BOLD YOU KNOW YOU KNOW JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF A DESTROYER WELL ROLE OF MOST DESTROYERS IS THEY'RE FAST THE MANEUVERABLE AND THEY'RE LIKE A SMALLER VERSION OF A CRUISER THEY HAVE ALL THE GUNNERY BUT SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'VE GOT FOUR BIG GUNS FOUR POINT FIVE GUNS AND OTHER SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'VE GOT ALL THOSE THE ONE THING THEY'VE GOT EXTRA APART FROM THE SMALLER SCALE DOWN THE BIG SHIPS HAVE NOT GOT ANTI SUBMARINE EQUIPMENT THEY'VE GOT TORPEDOES AND THINGS BUT UNLESS THEY'RE SUBMARINES ON THE SURFACE THEY'VE GOT NO DEPTH CHARGES SO ERM A DESTROYER HAS DEPTH CHARGES SO WE WERE THERE TOO BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIFFERENCE THE REASON WHY YOU GOT A DESTROYER AS WELL IS JUST AS I SAID IF THE CAPITAL SHIP OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE GUARDING IS TORPEDOED THE LAST RESULT IS YOU GETTING THE WAY OF THE TORPEDO THEY'D RATHER LOSE A SHIP THAT ONLY GOT TWO TWO HUNDRED MEN ON BOARD THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MEN ON THE BATTLESHIP REMOTE AS IT MIGHT BE IF IT GOT A TORPEDO BULGE AND THIS IS WHY WE SORT OF SHORT OF DESTROYERS BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM GET LOST BECAUSE THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN A TORPEDO IS SIGHTED IS TO GO TO ATTACK THE SUBMARINE THAT FIRED IT YOU SHOULD BE NEAR ENOUGH TO GET IN THE WAY OF THE TORPEDO IF IT HAPPENS TO BE HEADING YOUR WAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALKED A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WEREN'T A TIN YOU WERE VERY YOUNG CREW WAS THERE A MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE ON BOARD WHERE YOU THOUGHT WERE WORKING BRILLIANTLY NOW WELL NOT REALLY YOU JUST SORT OF FIT IN PART OF LIFE IS YOU MANAGED TO FIT INTO EVERY SITUATION IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH AND I WAS NEVER WORRIED YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD SWIMMER YOU MUST BE ALRIGHT EVEN IF THE SHIP SINKS BUT THEN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU SPEAK TO OTHER PEOPLE YOU'VE GOT SEA BOOTS ON AT THE TIME YOU HAVE A BELT WHICH ERM SHOULD SAVE YOU WHICH YOU WEAR ALL THE TIME AT SEA BUT YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT BELT BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT GETS IN THE WAY OF YOUR ARMS AND EVERYTHING SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU HAVE TO JUMP INTO THE HOGAN AS THEY CALL IT THE SEA THAT BELT MUSTN'T BE BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT MIGHT BREAK YOUR ARMS SO YOU'RE EXPECTED TO BLOW THAT UP WHEN YOU HIT THE SEA AND I CAN'T SEE HOW YOU GET LUCKILY I NEVER HAD TO BUT I HAVE SURVIVORS THAT HAVE TOLD ME YES I HAD TO BLOW IT UP AS SOON AS I HIT THE WATER AND I HAD NO BREATH AT ALL LEFT SO I COULDN'T BLOW IT UP BUT THE SEA BOATS DRAG YOU DOWN BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE WEARING SO IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG EVENT YOU RECALL THEM WELL IT WAS REALLY MUNDANE MOST OF THE THINGS EVEN AS ESCORT TO THE MONSTERS THAT WE DID YOUR ENEMY IN MOST CASES WAS A SEA GOT BATTERED LEFT RIGHT AND CENTRE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE QUEEN MARY AND QUEEN ELIZABETH BECAUSE AS WE TOOK THEM OUT OF THE CLYDE WE ZIGJAGGED ALL THE WAY WITH THEM AND WE KEPT UP WITH THEM UNTIL THEY REACHED THEIR TOP SPEED WHICH WAS THE DISTANCE ABOUT FURTHER OF THE WAY ACROSS AND THEN WE LEFT THEM AND WE EITHER WAITED AROUND FOR THE NEXT ONE COMING IN FOR INSTANCE WE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE QUEEN MARY OUT AND WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO WAIT JUST A FEW HOURS FOR THE QUEEN ELIZABETH TO COME IN AND ALL THE TIME ONE OF YOU MIGHT PICK UP ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU THAT THE QUEEN MARY WOULD HAVE ITS OWN ASIC BESIDES ITS OWN RADAR AND WE OF COURSE WE WERE AT THE ASIC AND THE RADAR AND OUR COHORT PERHAPS THE CAVALIER WOULD BE THE SAME WELL WHEN WE'D STEAM OUT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE A PART THAT THE EXTREMES OF YOUR ASDIC CIRCLE YOUR RADAR CIRCLE SO THAT YOU DIDN'T INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHER'S RECEIPT OF THE WAVE AND IF WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUBMARINE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A WRECK WILL IMMEDIATELY WE'D RUN UP A BLACK FLAG ON OUR FLAG DECK SO THE QUEEN MARY WOULD KNOW AND THEY'LL SHOW YOU THE CAVALIER WOULD KNOW THAT WE PICKED UP AN ECHO IMMEDIATELY WE'D HIVE OFF TO ATTACK THAT ECHO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE IN TROUBLE IF IT IS IF THAT'S A U BOAT IT MIGHT HAVE ALREADY FIRED ITS TORPEDO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU TURN OFF SWIFTLY AT FULL SPEED IF YOU CAN IF YOU GOT A BEAM C IF YOU CAN TURN OFF LEFT OR RIGHT YOU HIT WITH A B C THE DESTROYER YOU GOT HARDLY ANY DRAFT YOU'D TURN OVER STRAIGHT AWAY SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY VERY WELL YOU NEVER DID WHATEVER IT IS LUCK OR BY JUDGMENT I DON'T KNOW BUT ANYWAY THEN IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HIT BY A TORPEDO THEN YOU'D FIND YOUR WAY TO WHEREVER THAT ECHO WAS AND YOU WOULD ATTACK THE ECHO SO YOU LOOSE OFF ABOUT TWO DEPTH CHARGES FROM ONE SIDE TO FROM THE OTHER AND ROLL OFF OF THE TRUE RACKS FROM THE REAR SO HE'S PATTERN OF ABOUT TEN CHARGES WELL IF THE U BOAT IS A VERY EXPERIENCED ONE AND HE WAS WATCHING YOU ON THE PERISCOPE HE WOULDN'T BE THERE WHEN YOU ARRIVED HE WOULD EITHER HAVE GONE DOWN LOW OR HE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED IN THE OTHER DIRECTION BUT AT LEAST YOU KEPT HIM DOWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM HITTING YOUR CHARGE AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO TRY TO CATCH IT UP TAKE ABOUT HALF A DAY BECAUSE THEY'RE KEEPING THE SAME SPEED EVEN AFTER TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO LEAVE THE QUEEN MARY OR THE QUEEN ELIZABETH THE QUEEN MARY WOULD CARRY ON IT WOULDN'T STOP AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY'D ACTUALLY TORPEDOED TO QUEEN MARY THEN THEY WOULD HAVE LOST A LOT OF LIVES BECAUSE WHILE THE QUEEN MARY IF IT'S COMING BACK IN YOU'LL HAVE A FULL COMPLIMENT OF AMERICAN GIS AND THAT WOULD BE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND CARRYING NOW THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TIGHTEN UP THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BECAUSE THEY'D GO IN FROM THE DIFFERENT DECKS ALL THE TIME IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF WE GO INTO ACTION STATIONS THEN WE CLOSE OUR WATER TIGHT DOORS WHICH MEANS IF YOU'RE TORPEDOED YOUR MIND IT WILL ONLY DAMAGE THE COMPARTMENT WHERE YOU'RE WITHIN SO THE SHIP MOST LIKELY WON'T SINK BUT IF IT'S ON THE QUEEN MARY THEN THEY'VE GOT NO CHANCE OF ANY OF THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BEING CLOSED BECAUSE THEY'RE TRAVELLING BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT DECKS THEY'RE PERHAPS SLEEPING ON ONE DECK TRAVELLING UP THE NEXT DECK TO EAT FOOD ANOTHER DECK FOR EXERCISE THE TOP DECK IS ALWAYS EXERCISE SO YOU COULDN'T HAVE CLOSED THE CREW WATER TIGHT DOORS SO ANY OF THOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISASTERS YOU WOULD FIND WHAT WAS IT LIKE SEEING THE QUEEN MARY THE QUEEN ELIZABETH THE SAILING ONE DID YOU HAVE ANY FRIDAY WITH THE MEN WERE THESE SHIPS THAT YOU KNEW OF AND WERE PROUD OF ANYWHERE WELL ERM ALL WE REALLY KNEW WAS THAT WE WERE GOING TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS OR BRING ONE OF THE MONSTERS IN OR IF IT WAS THE QUEEN MARY AND WE WERE IN GREENOCK THEN WE WOULD KNOW IS THE THE COME IN WHERE WE WERE TAKEN OUT AND THAT'S ALWAYS GOT THREE FUNNELS ANYWAY IF WE PICKED UP IF HE'S GOT THREE FUNNELS IT'S QUEEN MARY AND HE GOT TWO FUNNELS IT'S QUEEN ELIZABETH AND SO ON YOU GOT FOUR FOUR FUNNELS WITH THE AQUITANIA AND SO IT WENT ON BUT YOU WERE NEVER TOLD YOU WOULD JUST SAIL OUT AND GO TO A RENDEVOO WHERE YOU WOULD WAIT AROUND OR YOU'VE ALREADY CONTACTED THAT SHIP TO SAY YOU'RE THERE AND YOU BRING IT IN VERY OFTEN EVEN WE TWO WERE ESCORTS ONE WOULD BE A GREEN OK AT THE CLYDE AND THE OTHER WOULD BE DOWN AT LIVERPOOL AND WE WOULD REACH A POINT OF RENDEVOO GOING OUT OF THE CLYDE AND THE OTHER ONE THE CAVALIER PERHAPS COME OUT OF LIVERPOOL AND THEN WE'D STEAM UP TOGETHER TO THE RENDEVOO POINT FOR THEM THE MONSTER THIS HAPPENED ALMOST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK FOR ONE OR OTHER US WE NEVER HAD THE SAME COHORT ERM BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T ALWAYS BE IN THE SAME AREA THEY'D BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE AND BETWEEN THAT IF YOU'RE A DUTY SHIP IF THERE WAS AIRCRAFT CARRIER WHICH HAPPENED IN ONE CASE A TORPEDOED WE'D JUST COME DOWN FROM SCAPE TO TO GREENOCK AND WE JUST ARRIVED AT THE HARBOUR ENTRANCE WE WENT STRAIGHT TO AN OILER BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO FILL UP WITH OIL BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO OUT AND JUST AS WE WERE AT THE OILER WE GOT AN EMERGENCY CALL TO SAY THAT AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER HAD BEEN TORPEDOED JUST OUT IN THE CLYDE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CLYDE SO WE JUST LET GO FROM THE OILER AND WE WENT STRAIGHT OUT TO TO THE THEN IT WAS AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND STRANGELY ENOUGH SHE WAS ON HER OWN SHE 'D COME FROM LONDONDERRY SHE'D HAD NO ESCORT LUCKILY SHE DIDN'T HAVE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF OF SEAMAN AND SO FORTH AND SHE WOULD COME INTO TO THE CLYDE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY TORPEDOED THAT THEY TORPEDOED A MERCHANT SHIP AT THE SAME TIME AND THE U BOAT GOT AWAY ALTHOUGH WE WENT TO ATTACK IT IT WAS DARK AND THE OTHERS I THINK LOOKING FOR THE U BOAT AFTERWARDS WHERE WE GOING BACK INTO HARBOUR HOW LONG ARE YOU AT SEA WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN THE ATLANTIC HOW OFTEN ARE YOU GOING BACK TO BASE AND GETTING LAND LOTS IN A DESTROYER NOT VERY LONG BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT MUCH FUEL AND THERE'S ALWAYS USING YOUR TOP SPEED ALWAYS MANEUVERING YOUR ONLY WAY OF GETTING FUEL IF YOU'RE OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS FOR FROM ONE OF THE BIGGER SHIPS EITHER FROM AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER OR SOMETHING AS BIG AS A BELFAST CRUISER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ALSO FOOD YOUR FOOD RUNS OUT AFTER A SHORT WHILE SO THE ONLY TIME WE WERE REALLY OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS WHEN WE WERE UP AT SCAPA WHEN YOU WERE WORKING UP WHEN WE WERE GOING OUT ON FOR AS TO TO HELP TO SINK THE PITS OR DOING OTHER JOBS MOST OF THE OTHERS IT WAS A CASE OF GOING OUT JUST FOR A DAY OR TWO TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS AND THEN COME BACK WITH THE MONSTER OR TAKE ONE OUT AND LEAVE IT IN WHICH CASE YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO TO LONDON DERRY PERHAPS AND THEN WE'D COME OUT OF LONDON DERRY AGAIN AND YOU KNOW GO OUT ON THAT SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT RESPECT THAT YOU KNOW WE WERE NOT UP FOR VERY LONG THERE WAS ONLY ONE OCCASION WHEN WE WAS OUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME IT MUST HAVE BEEN OVER THE FIVE DAYS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE OCCASION WAS BUT WE HAD RUN OUT OF FOOD AND WE WAS FURTHER UP IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND OUR CAPTAIN WAS A X FISHERY FLEET MAN HE HAD HIS OWN FISHERY FLEET THEN SO WHAT HE DECIDED TO DO AS WE RUN OUT OF FOOD HE SAID I KNOW WHERE THE FISH ARE SO HE GUIDED THE SHIP UP TO WHERE HE KNEW THEY WERE PICKED UP A SHOW ON THE RADAR ON THE AS DECK DROPPED AT A DEPTH CHARGE LOWERED THE BOAT PICKED UP ALL THE FISH THAT CAME UP THAT WAS STUNNED HE STOOD ON THE FOLKS WE SAW HIM STANDING ON THE FOLKS AND SAID UP MY MIND PICKED THE FIGURES ONE WE LIVED ON FISH FOR A FUNERAL DAYS AFTER THAT SO THE ONE VERY GOOD BUT OUR RUNS WERE MOSTLY JUST ABOUT FIVE DAYS AT THE TIME BUT THAT MEANT THAT EVERY TIME WE CAME INTO THE ER EITHER SCAPE OR IF WE WERE IN LIVERPOOL OR TO DECIDE WE HAD TO ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF FUEL ON BOARD BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A IF YOUR DUTY DESTROYER AND THEN IF SOMETHING COMES UP WHERE SHIPS BEING SUNK YOU HAD TO GO OUT STRAIGHT AWAY AND YOU MIGHT BE OUT FOR A LONG TIME LOOKING FOR A SUBMARINE OR MORE THAN ONE SUBMARINE SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THE FACT THAT WE NEVER WENT OUT FOR A LONG TIME OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OILING AT SEA WHICH IS A DANGEROUS PRACTICE ANYWAY AND PICKING UP FOOD AND EVERYTHING FROM IT CAN YOU DESCRIBE RADAR YES THE JOB YOU WERE DOING RADAR YES YOU DO WELL FIRST OF ALL WHEN I WAS ON THE RADIO SET IT WAS ONLY A SMALL SET AND IT DIFFERENT TYPES THE TWO NINE THREE THAT IS HIGH UP ON THE MAST AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY FOR PICKING UP AIRCRAFT OR SURFACE SHIPS REALLY ANY ANY DISTANCE I CAN'T I CAN'T THINK OF THE RANGE RANGE OF IT BUT IT SENDS OUT A SIGNAL FROM THERE WHICH OF COURSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT ANYTHING YOU DON'T GET IT BACK BUT IF IT HITS ANYTHING EVEN CLIFFS OR AN AIRCRAFT OR A SURFACE SHIP THEN IT BALANCES BACK AND ON THE SCREEN YOU ERM WHICH IS AROUND SCREEN AND THE THE CURSOR IS GOING ROUND ALL THE TIME THAT WILL SHOW A BLIP AND THAT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S A CLOUD WHICH IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE DEPENDING ON YOUR RADAR WHETHER IT'S DOING VERTICAL OR ANGULAR AND YOU WILL THEN READ OFF THE DISTANCE AN ANGLE OF EVERYTHING IF THIS IS MOSTLY ON A LEVEL BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER SCREAM WHICH GIVES YOU THE HEIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT SO YOU USE ONE WITH THE OTHER THAT WHEN THAT SIGNAL ELECTRONIC SIGNAL HITS ANYTHING THEN IT RETURNS AND THEN YOU READ OFF THE DISTANCE OF IT BUT IS IT EASY TO USE NO IT'S EASIER TO USE EM WHERE YOU FIND THE DIFFICULTY IS BY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT EITHER LAND BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF IT ON THERE OR IF IT'S A SMALL BLIP THEN IS AN AIRCRAFT A SHIP OR WHATEVER IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE USING ONE TYPE OF RADAR IT'S ONLY ONLY HORIZONTAL IF YOU'RE USING ANOTHER ONE IT CAN BE HORIZONTAL OR AN AIRCRAFT AND IT WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD DISTANCE THE TIME IT TAKES OF COURSE IS BASED ON IF IT TAKES TEN SECONDS TO GET FROM THERE TO THERE THEN IT'S AND YOU READ IT OFF IN BETWEEN LUCKILY AT OUR POINT IN THE WAR WE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE OF AIRCRAFT THE ONLY TIME WE WOULD HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THAT IS IF THE TORPEDO BOMBERS HAD BEEN SENT AFTER US OFF NORWAY THEN YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO USE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD KNOW THE YOU'D HAVE TO USE THE TWO RADAR SETS THEN THE ONE THAT GIVES YOU A SIGNAL IN THE HEIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT AND THE OTHER ONE WHICH GIVES YOU THE DISTANCE OF IT THEN YOU'RE TRAINED TO KNOW WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER IF IT WAS ONE OF YOUR OWN AIRCRAFT IT WOULD HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION SIGNAL WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW ON YOUR RADAR SET BEFORE IT GOT TO YOU SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE HAVE PRETTY WELL EXPERIENCED BUT MY TIME WAS NOT ALWAYS ON A RADAR SET YOU WERE SOMETIMES LOOK OUT AS A SEAMAN WHERE YOU'RE SITTING UP IN A LOOKOUT BOX ON THE STARBOARD SIDE AS MINE AND YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR AIRCRAFT WHICH WAS NOT VERY OFTEN WE ARE ERM SURFACE SHIPS OR MORE THAN LIKELY YOU WERE LOOKING OUT FOR A LITTLE TINY PERISCOPE WHICH IS VERY HARD TO SEE IN A ROUGHER ATLANTIC OR YOU MIGHT BE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE THE TRACK OF A TORPEDO COMING TOWARD YOU IN WHICH CASE YOU GET INTO A PANIC AND CALL OUT QUICKLY TO THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE THE CAPTAIN OR THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH AT THE TIME IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE NOWADAYS IT'S ENCLOSED BUT IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE SO THE BRIDGE IS HERE YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK OUT JUST HERE TO JUST CALL OUT TO THAT PERSON ON THE BRIDGE THE OFFICER SHIP BEARING RED FIVE GREEN FIVE WHERE YOUR POSITION IS ANGLE OF SIGHT IF IT'S AN AIRCRAFT AND YOU IMMEDIATELY LOOK AT IT AND DECIDE WHAT ACTION TO TAKE BUT IF YOU'RE ON THAT LOOKOUT POSITION WHICH I WAS ON QUITE A LOT AS A SEAMAN IS ROUGH BECAUSE AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN ALL THE TIME BEING A DESTROYER YOU'RE ALMOST A SUBMARINE AT TIMES THE WHOLE OF THE SEA COMES UP OVER YOU AND YOU GET KNOCKED BACK AGAINST THE SEARCHLIGHT AND IT WAS VERY DAMP THAT IS VERY ROUGH UNCOMFORTABLE AND THIS IS WHAT YOU GET USED TO YOU USED TO WEAR A SPECIAL SUIT WHICH COVERED YOU COMPLETELY WATERPROOF SUIT WITH CAPE OPINING BUT EVEN EVEN THAT THE WATER ALL THE WAY DOWN AND YOU GOT SOAKING WET I REMEMBER COMING OFF WATCH ON ONE OCCASION LIKE THIS BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO CLIMB BACK DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE LADDERS OF THE SHIP BECAUSE THE DOORS THAT YOU WOULD GO IN AND OUT IN PORT WERE OPEN WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA THOSE DOORS WILL BE CLOSED BECAUSE THE WATER COMES IN THOSE SO YOU HAVE TO CLIMB DOWN LADDERS DOWN THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP NOT NOT OUTSIDE IN THE SEA BUT CLIMB DOWN FROM THE TOP DECK TO THE LOWER DECK AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL THE WAVE IN IT HITS YOU YOU CAN GET WASHED AWAY SO HOLD ON VERY TIGHT WELL THIS WAS THE MIDDLE WATCH THAT I CAN RECALL WHICH IS FROM TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING FOR TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BUT YOU'RE NOT ON WATCH LOOKOUT ALL THAT TIME OF THE FOUR HOUR WATCH YOU DO DIFFERENT JOBS HALF HOUR ON LOOKOUT HALF HOUR PERHAPS ON THE RADAR SET OFF OUR ONE HALF HOUR BEHIND A GUN WHERE THERE'S A GUN YOU BECOME PART OF THE GUN CREW SO IF YOU DID HAVE TO GO INTO ACTION YOU WOULD DO THE SHOOTING WHILE THE REAL GUN CREW IS CALLED UP TO TAKE OVER FROM YOU WELL ON THIS OCCASION IT HAD BEEN VERY WET OUTSIDE I'D GOT SOAK IN AND TIRED I SAY MIDDLE WATCH PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK I'D COME DOWN SO I WENT DOWN TO MY MESS DECK WHICH I DIDN'T FALL IT WAS A ROUGH PART OF THE SHIP I HADN'T SLUNG MY HAMMOCK I SLEPT ON THE ER CUSHIONS AND THIS TIME I DIDN'T FANCY TO SLEEPING ON THE CUSHIONS BECAUSE THE SHIP WAS GOING SO MUCH THIS WAY AND I KNEW I'D COME OFF THE CUSHIONS SO I GOT DOWN UNDER THE MESS TABLE THERE WAS ABOUT THAT MUCH WATER ON THE FLOOR THE DECK SORRY NOT THE FLOOR ON THE DECK ABOUT THAT MUCH SO I GOT ALL MY CODE ON THE THIS SUIT IT AS YOU CALLED IT AND EVERYTHING AND I'M LAYING DOWN THERE OFF TO SLEEP STRAIGHT AWAY NEXT THING I KNOW A FOOT HAD TOUCHED ME AND I OPENED MY BLEARY EYES AND THERE WAS THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH AND THE LEADING SEAMAN AND THE MESS AND HE WAS SAYING TO ME I'M TOLD THIS IN THE MORNING BY THE LEADING HAND OF THE MESS HE SAID THE OFFICER SAID TO YOU COME ON SEAMAN YOU CAN'T SLEEP UNDER THERE IT'S TOO WET AND I SAID AND HE LOOKED AT THE LEADING HAND AND SAID WHAT DID HE SAY AND THE LEAD I DON'T KNOW I DON'T READ THAT LANGUAGE AND SO OH WELL WE BETTER YOU LET HIM SLEEP THERE AND HE LEFT ME THERE NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT IT TO A WELL YOU'RE LYING IN THAT MUCH WATER THE DECKS OF THE SHIPS WERE INSIDE YOU KNOW INSIDE YOUR MESS DECK THE WATER JUST IT'S ONE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE AND A LITTLE BIT WARMER INSIDE SO YOU GET ALL HUMIDITY ALL THE WATER RUNS DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE DECKS ANY TIME YOU'RE ON THE CAVALIER YOU HAVE A LOOK AND THE INSIDE BECAUSE YOUR METAL WORK OF THE SHIP'S SIDE IT WAS ONLY ABOUT EIGHT OF AN INCH NO THICKER THAN THAT AND SO THERE THEY ALWAYS YOU GOT WATER MOST OF THE TIME YOU ON YOUR MESS DECKS WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA AND YOU'RE IN HARBOUR YOU'RE NOT TOO BAD SO IT GETS A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE THERE WAS ANOTHER TIME WHEN WE WORKED WITH THE QUEEN MARY AND WE HAD TO PICK HER UP TO BRING HER IN WE WENT OUT AND IT WAS IN ONE OF THE ROUGHEST STORMS WE HAD ABOUT THREE REALLY ROUGH STORMS IN THE PERIOD THAT WE WORKING IN THE ATLANTIC AND WE HAD TO AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE ABOUT MARCH NINETEEN FORTY FIVE WE HAD TO GO AND PICK UP THE QUEEN MARY NOW THE STORM HAD BEEN RAGING ALL THE WAY FROM AMERICA AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE THE BIG STORM THAT HAD COME ACROSS OUR WAY AND THE QUEEN MARY BROUGHT IT WITH A SORT OF THING AND WE PICKED HER UP AND I THINK WE WERE A DAY OR MORE WAITING TO PICK HER UP BECAUSE EVEN SHE HAD BEEN HELD UP QUITE A BAD STORMS WELL WE AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAS THE SISTER SHIP AT THAT TIME BUT WE GOT REALLY BENT UP WE LOST A MOTORBOAT WE LOST ONE OF THE WHALERS ERM AND WE GOT REALLY KNOCKED THEM OUT AND WHEN WE GOT TOWARDS THE CLYDE THE THE QUEEN MARY KNOWING THAT IT WAS IN THE AREA THAT THERE WOULD BE U BOATS HAD TO RELY ON OUR SPEED BUT COULD BE SO AS AS WE GOT WITHIN HAILING DISTANCE I SUPPOSE IF YOU SAY THE CLYDE AND THE QUEEN MARY DECIDED SHE COULDN'T SLOW DOWN TO KEEP UP WITH US BECAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH FOR US WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER AND SO SHE JUST FLASHED A MESSAGE SEE YOU IN THE CLYDE SET OFF AND SHE KEPT UP HER SPEED AND GOT INTO THE CLYDE NOW SHE HAD THE WHOLE OF THE FRONT OF HER BRIDGE STOVE IN AND IT WAS A BIG SHIP WELL UP IN THE AIR THEY HAD A LOT OF CASUALTIES BECAUSE THEY WERE CARRYING THEM OUT TWELVE THOUSAND TROOPS AND THIS WAS NOW LATE AT NIGHT I THINK ABOUT ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT BUT ANYWAY SHE GOT INTO THE CLYDE WITHOUT ANYTHING BUT DAMAGE FROM FROM THE SEA WE LIMPED IN LATER ON NOW IN THE CLYDE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ANCHOR AND WE COULDN'T GO FURTHER IN TO GREENOCK TO GREENOCK BECAUSE AFTER THAT YOU GO THROUGH THE BOOM AND THE BOOM IS CLOSED AT NIGHT UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY SARY TO OPEN THE BOOM WHICH PREVENTS OR HELPS TO PREVENT AND U BOATS GETTING AT THAT POINT SO AT THE OTHER SIDE WHERE WE HAD TO TIE UP TO A BOY WE HAVE TWO BOY JUMPERS TO TIE UP TO A BOY YOU HAVE TO STOP AND YOU HAVE TO LOWER YOUR WHALER WITH THE BOY JUMPER AND THE ROWERS IN IT TO TAKE YOU TO THE BOY WITH THE CHAIN TO CLIP IT TO THE BOY WELL IF I'VE GIVEN YOU A PICTURE OF HOW ROUGH THE STORM WAS IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT FIRST WHALER WE WE ERM A LET DOWN ONTO THE WATER MANAGED TO GET DOWN SAFELY BUT IT GOT WASHED AWAY WITH A CREW IN IT FURTHER DOWN THE CLYDE THAT WAS A WAY FOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO LOWER ANOTHER WHALER ALL OF US WAS UP ON THE FOLKS YOU KNOW ALL THE SEAMEN THAT COULD HELP WAS UP ON THE FOLKS AND BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE YOUR ANCHOR YOU'RE JUST USING YOUR ANCHOR CHAIN WHICH GOES WITH A WIRE ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE ANCHOR CHAIN AND THE WHALER HAS TO TAKE THIS WIRE TO THE BOY TO CLAMP IT ONTO THE BOY AND THEN THE BOYS PULLED BY THE ANCHOR CHAIN NEARER THE SHIP SO THAT THEY CLIP IT ON SO ANYWAY THEY LOWERED THE SECOND WHALER THE BOY JUMPER MANAGED TO GET ONTO THE BOY AND IN DOING SO BROKE HIS WRIST AND IN THE END AFTER I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO CLIP UP TO THE BOY AND THE CAPTAIN SAID TOPS ALL AROUND I HATED THE SMELL OF RUM ANYWAY AND NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD THE TOP BECAUSE IT'S HORRIBLE BUT I HAD IT THAT NIGHT BECAUSE WE WERE FROZEN FROZEN STIFF AND WE LANDED TO GET AWAY WITH IT BUT NOTHING WAS EVER SAID ABOUT THIS TYPE OF THING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH PEOPLE AT THE PORTS KNEW THE BIG SHIPS COME AND COME IN IT WAS NOT A THING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THE GERMANS ALSO KNEW THAT THEY WERE BRINGING ALL THESE LARGE NUMBERS BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS IT COULD CARRY ANY OF THE U BOAT CAPTAINS I UNDERSTAND AND THIS IS NORMAL KNOWLEDGE WERE OFFERED A LARGE SUM OF MONEY THOUSANDS OF WHAT THEY DO TO JOYCE MARK DISH MARK THOUSANDS DOES MARK AND THE HIGHEST OF THE OF HONOURS TO HAVE KNOCKED DOWN ANY ONE OF THESE MONSTERS BUT WE NEVER LOST ONE FORTUNATELY HAP YOU TO SAY BUT THE QUEAMARY WAS REALLY BATTERED VERY BADLY BATTERED HOW WE DIDN'T GET TURNED OVER I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHEN ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT BIG SEAS WHAT SORT OF SIZE ARE YOU TALK WELL IF YOU'RE ERM THE SEAS ITSELF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL THERE IT'S GENERALLY KNOWN THAT SOME OF THE WAVES WERE SIXTY FOOT HIGH NOW IF YOU THINK OF SIXTY FOOT GOING UP THAT WAY WHEN YOU GO UP TO THE WAVE AND YOU COME DOWN TO THE TROUGH YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOOT AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN CUT THROUGH THOSE WAVES THE BIG SHIPS ALL THE SMALL SHIPS YOU ACTUALLY GO UP ON THAT WAVE AND THEN YOU FEEL IT AND YOU COME DOWN WITH A CRUNCH LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU UP TO THE NEXT ONE AND ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CORK SCREEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT STILL AND YOU GET USED TO THIS AFTER THE FIRST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE YOU GOT BRUISED ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE YOU GO THROUGH A NORMAL MORE FLATS THEY'RE CALLED ON A DESTROYER THE NORMAL CORRIDOR ON THE FLOOR ON A AND DESTROYER RICHARD ABOUT THAT WIDE WELL WHEN YOU FIRST GO ABOARD ONE LIKE THAT AND IT WAS FAIRLY CALM WHEN YOU SET OUT FOR SCAPE FROM GREENOCK BUT AS YOU WALK ALONG THE DECK COMES UP TO MEET YOU IT GOES UP AND YOU HIT YOUR FEET AS YOU GO DOWN ON THE DECK BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THAT DECK HAS GONE AWAY AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN AND THIS HITS YOU FROM THE TOP AND THEN WELL THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING THIS THIS BULK HITS YOU ACTUALLY KNOW THAT BUT HITS YOU SO IN TIME YOU LEARN TO WALK LIKE A SAILOR AND AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN YOU GO DOWN WITH IT AND COME UP WITH IT AND THAT'S YOU'LL FIND SAILORS AND WHEN YOU GET ASHORE THEY WORK WITH A ROLE WALK WITH A ROLE THAT IS JUST THAT STILL WALKING ON THE SHIP SO AFTER THE END OF THE WAR I E DAY RIGHT YOU'RE NOT FINISHED YEAH AND V DAY ITSELF WE WERE AS THE NINTH OF MAY WE WERE BRINGING IN THE OLDER FRANKS AND WE GOT NOTICED THAT THE PEACE ERM HAD BEEN DECLARED FOR THE NEXT DAY WE WERE GOING INTO INTO GREENOCK SO WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN THE LAST OF THE ONE SHIP CONVOYS BEFORE THE WAR ENDED WE ARRIVED IN GREEN OK I BELIEVE IT WAS EITHER WEDNESDAY OR SUNDAY HALF THE SHIP'S COMPANY WAS ALLOWED LEAVE WHICH WASN'T ME I'M AFRAID I WASN'T ONE OF THE SHIPS COMPANY BUT THEY WENT ASHORE TO GREENOCK AND HAD A GOOD ERM YOU KNOW TIME SO THEN WE STILL CARRIED ON WITH SOME OF THESE CONVOYS AFTER THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS QUITE A FEW OF THE U BOATS THAT APPARENTLY MISSING A LOT OF THEM ONE OR TWO WENT TO BRAZIL OR WHATEVER SO THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE THAT IF THERE WAS A U BOAT AROUND THEY COULD HAVE KNOCKED DOWN SOME OF THE ERM MONSTERS WE WERE STILL BRINGING BACK IN BUT WE HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL BUT TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT ANYWAY WE WERE THEN DESTINED TO GO ACROSS TO THE END TRIED TO END THE JAPANESE WAR SO TWO BY TWO OR FLOTILLA WENT IN FOR REFITS WE WENT IN FOR REFIT LATE IN MAY JUNE BECAUSE WE WERE GOING OUT THERE ANYWAY BUT FORTUNATELY WHILE I WAS ON LEAVE TO GO OUT THERE THE SHIP WAS DOWN AT DEVONPORT BEING REFITTED THE WAR ENDED SO I STILL GOT A TELEGRAM TO SAY DAY LEAVE EXTRA DAYS LEAVE EXTRA WHEN WE CAME BACK TO THE SHIP WE STILL HAD TO GO OUT THERE BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING TO CLEAR UP AFTER THE WAR WELL THE WHOLE OF OUR FLOTILLA WERE OUT THERE THEN WE WERE THE LAST TWO SO AS WE WENT OUT GIBRALTAR MALTA AIDAN AND PLACES LIKE THAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE IN A LOVELY SUMMER CRUISE BUT THEN WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE NO WHEN WE GOT TO TRINCOMALEE THAT WAS OUR NAVAL BASE WERE BASED AT TRINCOMALEE AND WERE ALSO BASED AT SINGAPORE OR WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE ERM THIS WAS JUST ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THE WAR AND WE WERE CARRYING OUT AN EXERCISE WITH HMS SUSSEX AND ANOTHER SHIP AND THE CAPTAIN THE THE FLOTILLA LEADER WHO WAS ON HMS SELA AND OURSELVES IN CAVALIER WERE ORDERED TO GO WITH THE SUSSEX TO A PROBLEM SO WE IMMEDIATELY WENT AT FULL SPEED WE WERE SENT TO THE JAVA WE STOPPED ON A COUPLE OF TROOP SHIPS ON THE WAY CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT BUT WE TOOK ON BOARD OUR FULL DECK WAS COVERED WITH INDIAN TROOPS ARMED INDIAN TROOPS AND THE CAVALIER WAS THE SAME AND THE CAR WAS ALSO AND THE SUSSEX ANCHORED OUTSIDE SURABAYA BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GET IN WE COULD HARDLY GET IN BECAUSE THERE WAS A SUNKEN JAPANESE CRUISER IN THERE IN THE WAY SO CESAR WENT IN FIRST BECAUSE SHE WAS FLED TO THE LEADER FULL OF TROOPS WE WENT IN SECONDS AS WE WERE SECOND AND THEN THE CAVALIER AFTERWARDS AS WE WENT IN IT WAS DAYLIGHT WE HAD ALL THESE TROOPS ON BOARD SO IF WE HAD ANY TROUBLE WE COULDN'T HAVE USED OUR GUNS BECAUSE LUCKILY WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE FROM THE SHORE BUT WE CAME INTO SURABAYA I WAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE AND THERE WAS BODIES DOZENS OF THEM IN WHITE NAVAL UNIFORM I THINK THEY WERE QUITE PROBABLY DUTCH I DON'T THINK THEY WAS OURS BUT WERE SLOWLY MOVING AVOIDING THIS WRECKAGE AND AVOIDING THE BODIES AND YOU GOT TO THE STAGE NOW WHEN WE WERE IN THE WAR BODIES IN THE WATER MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU YOU ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT THEY WERE BODIES AND DEAD YOU KNOW SO ANYWAY WE SLOWLY MOVED IN WE ANCHORED IN THE DOCK THERE AND ONE BY ONE THE CRUISER DISGORGED HER TROOPS FIRST AND WE CAME IN NEXT SO THE THREE OF US ALL OUR TROOPS WENT ASHORE THE DOCKS HAD BEEN ALREADY TAKEN OVER BY ARE THE U K ARMY I THINK HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN AHEAD AND IT WAS THE INDONESIAN REBELS THAT WERE FIGHTING THEY HAD ALREADY KILLED BRIGADIER MALA THAT WAS THE ARMY BOSS AND THESE TROOPS WENT ASHORE AND WE STAYED THERE READY FOR A LOT OF SURVIVORS OF THE DUTCH PEOPLE THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS FROM CAMP RIGHT THE OTHER SIDE OF ERM SURVEYOR AND THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT UNDER AN ESCORT OVER ANOTHER TRUCE THE NONE OF YOU HAD BEEN KILLED UNDER A TRICE NOW THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DUTCH PEOPLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN MOSTLY IN A CAMP AT THE OTHER SIDE THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS BY ANOTHER TRUCE ERM ARMY TRUCKS GUARDED BY INDIAN TROOPS THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS TO US AND WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THEM ON BOARD AND WE WERE TO TAKE THEM OUT TO THE TROOPERS WHICH COULDN'T GET INTO THE HARBOUR WELL WE WERE THEN TOLD WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR THESE PEOPLE TO COME ACROSS WE WERE TO GO OUT INTO THE WATER BECAUSE WE MIGHT BE USED WHICH WAS WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AS IT HAPPENED WHEN THIS CONVOY OF ARMY TRUCKS GUARDED BY INDIAN TROOPS GOT AS FAR AS SURABAYA THEY FOUND THAT THEY WERE STOPPED ALTHOUGH THEY HAD A WHITE FLAG THEY WERE STOPPED BY THE POST OFFICE WHICH WAS FULL OF INDIAN AN INDONESIAN REBELS THE INDIAN REBELS WERE SET UP TRENCH MALTS AND MACHINE GUNS AND AS SOON AS THE CONVOY GOT THERE THEY SHOT THE TROOPS THAT WERE GUARDING THE CONVOY AND THE CONVOY COME TO THE HALT SO WE WERE CALLED IN TO USE OUR FOUR INCH FOUR OR FIVE GUNS SO WE HAD TO FIRE ON THE TOWN AND WE TOOK OUT THE POST OFFICE WITH THE INDONESIAN TROOPS IN IT AND THEN THE CONVOY COME THROUGH WE WENT BACK INTO HARBOUR AND WE HAD ALL THE DUTCH PEOPLE ON BOARD AND WE TOOK THEM OUT TO SAY SO WE DID WE DIDN'T PERSONALLY HAVE TO GO ASHORE I HAD TO GO ASHORE LATER ON TO GUARD SOME OF THE WAREHOUSES AND AND SO ON BUT WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO ANY FIGHTING THE ONLY FIGHTING WE HAD TO DO WAS FIRING A GUN BECAUSE I WAS ON THE UPPER DECK AT THE TIME WHEN WE WERE CALLED IN TO FIRE AND I WAS CALLED OFF THE UPPER DECK TO FIRE MY GUN AND I SAID I'M NOT GONNA THEY SAID YOU'RE TODAY SO THEY PUT ME ON THE ON THE GUN GUNNERY WAS ANOTHER ONE AND WE HAD TO FIRE TO THE DIRECTION OF A SPOTTER PLANE THAT WAS SENT UP BY THE ARMY IS A SPOTTER PLANE AND APPARENTLY WE TOOK OUT THE POST OFFICE SO HAD THE GOOD DEAL WITH SOMETHING WE DID HAVE THEM IN BOARD OVERNIGHT A LOT OF THESE DUTCH PEOPLE WE VACATED ALL THE FOREIGN MESS DECKS AND HAD TO SLEEP DOWN AT ON THE UPPER DECK AND DIFFERENT PLACES AND THE DUTCH PEOPLE WOMEN WERE IN THE FRONT THERE UNTIL WE TOOK THEM OUT TO THE U S THE OTHER SHIPS THAT AND THEN WE GOT OUR PLACE BACK AND I LOST A PAIR OF SAND OR THEY DISAPPEARED HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU'RE SAILING INTO A HARBOUR THERE AND YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF NAVAL PEOPLE WELL YOU'RE YOU'RE APPREHENSIVE TO START WITH BUT AT THE A U R AND YOU'RE VERY SELDOM FRIGHTENED ERM I SUPPOSE YOU WERE A DRILL
