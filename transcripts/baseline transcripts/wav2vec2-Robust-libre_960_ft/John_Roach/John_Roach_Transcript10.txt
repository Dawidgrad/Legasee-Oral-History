yet you touched on him earlier cause he got on well with a but what was your skipper like what cars we had four or five skippers on board during the only lasted about just one or two years on board our first skipper was phila cole simeon and then we had a cup called daniel they all became admirals after that you know and then we had a then we had a we mcgregor and then then we had a fellow called b c b broke he was one of the the ragas of sarawak family books and he and when he got he took us out to the far east then when we went to out to trincomalee in nineteen forty four forty three the end of nineteen forty three we ended there to the far east fleet i was going to ask you about that i mean well just before so did different skippers bring different attitudes ideas were so different no not really i think they seem to nowadays but in my because you you had a fully worked up efficient ship and you couldn't change any of that the ship was fairly good at gunnery and good at seaman ship and good of getting the ship to sea and everything like good at maintenance and keeping the ship spick and span there wasn't much else that the captain could change really and of course he was under instructions where he went and what operations that he undertook so so really you know i they didn't then not to my knowledge that i can remember that they'd done a lot of alterations you might be aware you know the some of the officers might have been more aware of him you know you know you know they would have to watch him to see what he liked and what he disliked or something but but the only sailor now just took one cup and the same as another really so that i get the ship ready to go to sea and and and and fought the ship as need be but whatever captain was in charge of but they were all highly experienced men anyway the you know you didn't become a for ring captain and captain of a battle cruiser unless you had had a good bit of experience you know case of a vis broke don't fix it a case of if it's not broke oh don't fix it that's right oh that's right oh no there there was no nothing very much really nothing changed with one cup into another one if it was a good ship and it was a lucky ship and wind all our captains done a set time on board cos they were all very proud to to captain a ship like that well it was proved and every one of em got got made an admiral afterwards so so they must have done a good job what was it like going down south to the indian ocean that operating down there all very different we are when we went we went into the med had got a bit quite then down through the south's canal and out and came into a into columbo and then we went round to the other side and we were based in trincomalee and then we went on a few a few trips there we done some bombardment over in sam saban or something and then in the nicobar and the andaman islands we done some bombardment over there and and then they some aircraft from the illustrious and we we had an american carrier there i think that was a wasp again and that went with us so there's quite a big fleet there although then the fleet was certain to build up down in australia then mostly for for the pacific war you know so we we stayed around in in in trincomalee and running out across the indian ocean over there so the you know i think the the japanese were begin to get on to be put on the run of it by then you know and then then the main fleet went down to to to sydney and we stayed in in sicily and expat the renown went down then to durban and had a refit down there but all of us the fellows who had been on the ship about five years and they decide that it was time we were sent home and do some coursing so we're all thrown off the ship we didn't get a chance to go and never went to durban the best run that we could have had them on the whole of the five years we missed out on it or we were all put ashore and then the ship came back from durban and then they decided that there weren't enough heavy ships back in eu cay in case the the the terprets of the other the teeth other turpits broke out so renown was recalled back to u k so she steamed about and then then they changed another lot of the crew the they picked up about five hundred people who had spent a lot most of the war and around the middle they were the far east and brought them back home and then the the the the the renowned came back and she was based up up in scapa flow and then there was into nineteen forty five and then she came down to rosie and then i think the german admirals came aboard and the the the the the peace deal and handing over the german navy was signed on board renown you a side oh i know i was i was left out there so i ended up in n in in columbo but i eventually came home on a troop ship and what was it like for a young man like you you know from from humble beginnings to be station in you know to co to come away that must have been amazing it was a bit of a dump really or so we went ashore and we had to make our own football pitch there again there was a canteen there and we were rationed to two two bottles of beer each and that's all you got so you think and believe sepa swimming over the side and plain water polo there on must have been a sailing there wasn't have much else to do really we had a good we are a good chaplain on board and he every week you have a chaplin's hour and get all the talent on board you know and he was have a bit of a concert with which is fairly good so we all slept on the upper deck of course and brought your hammock and all your bed and on the upper deck and the and because it was so hot you wouldn't sleep down below and though those ships we had no air conditioning you see it was very very warm down below in those ships i mean now as ships gone out there now they've all all got air condition and we didn't even have cold water we look at have water we didn't have any cold water or no refrigerators and the mass or anything like that so it's pretty basic living really and then you couldn't use too much water even for bath and a cars cause all water you made on the ship was needed for the boilers for steaming really that was a situation on renown and most of the all the war really they didn't make enough enough water for for human consumption if you like how well you replied how long could it stay say before it needed replenishment well on how long could you be at sea before you needed replenishment course i don't know i suppose you could say see a couple of months cause we we had big big freezes and and plenty of tin food on board and it all depends how much steaming you're done you know how much fuel i mean you know at what speed you were doing you know if you if you'd done a fast speed of course you would use up your oil fuel quickening it up to go into harbour and replenish cause there was no i mean if we had destroyers with us we we used to fuel the destroyers but there wasn't a lot of these like they've got these replenishment at sea now with these royal fleet auxiliary ships there weren't any of them around not not at sea then we we we never fueled at sea ourselves we fuel a lot of other ships so it depends how much fuel had how long you could stay at sea us both
