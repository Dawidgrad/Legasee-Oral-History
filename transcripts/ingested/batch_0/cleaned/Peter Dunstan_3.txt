what was the sort of sense on board when you knew you were now engaged probably for the first time in a proper battle with serious you know with potential a serious outcome i can't really tell you my gunnery position when i was not on duty in the machine shop and that was on the port side number one dual purpose five twenty five gun and my position was in the transfer section where the shells came and the ammunition came up from the magazines and into the space where i was which was then transferred to the guns and what was i mean it must have been an immense spectacle is it terrifying i mean can you try and record some of what you were seeing i it was in a more or less sealed compartment on the first one deck below the upper deck you didn't see anything all you knew was the fact that when the guns fired you had to get another operate a lever and get another section of ammunition up from the magazines so you didn't know what was going on all you knew was the explosion the noise of the guns firing was the hood on the port side of you as well no she was ahead of us she was about what a quarter of a mile i think i can only guestimate that she was about a quarter of a mile in front of the prince of wales and the only thing that happened when she blew up there was a piece of the hood that landed somehow or another in the space of that a piece of the hood when she blew up landed on the foc'sle the front of the prince of wales one of these amazing things you know the two ships a quarter of a mile apart one blows up and a piece of the ship that blew up landed on the prince of wales when you were hit do you recall feeling that that impact no you're talking about a thirty five thousand ton battleship and an explosion of a shell hitting you you didn't even hear feel it what happens after an engagement like that i mean this is the first time isn't it what can you do as a young man who's just been involved in something like that with the noise how do you wind down or do you not no you don't just one of those things no more than as i'm sitting here now i mean you're trained to obey orders and you just carry on ok so after you've engaged the bismarck you head back to the uk is that right yes what do you recall of that and what was it like you know being back because you've obviously been out and you come back did you get leave well we went straight into knowing we got water trouble well at the time there was the flooding in the after magazine we went straight into rosyth and straight into the dockyard the dry dock at rosyth of course when they pumped the water out of the prince of wales and they got down to find out why the flooding was in the after magazine they found this dirty great big fourteen inch shell laying there not far from the after magazine and there was a right panic everybody clear the ship and the ship was cleared and then they got down and cut the side plate of the ship out and lifted the shell out and repaired that and then we were allowed back aboard ship again great fun
