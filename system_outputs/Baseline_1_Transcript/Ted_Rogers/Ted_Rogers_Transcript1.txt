you my name is edward rodgers but i'm normally called ted for short a where are you from i was born in liverpool nineteen twenty four a long time ago now and so in nineteen thirty nine you were fifteen years of age do remember the liverpool blitz yes i was living in twenty eight steady road and am brought near broad green it wasn't quite agreement to far away what do you remember of the liverpool blitz were you evacuate of the blitz no i i went to see that a blitz was in nineteen forty and we we had an anderson shelter in the garden and we all started scrambled into that and because we are a big family we in a double one and my father arranged a big sort of wooden wooden sort of stage at one end of it and that was used as a bed and so we heard quite a bit of it my uncle was bombed out he lived about a mile away from where we were and that was in nineteen forty the next year i went to see a nineteen forty one actually but so why did you want to go to sea rather than any other service well first of all i joined the home guard when i was fifteen i pictured that my uniform my father joined the home guard and he been the first real war and he was a corporal then before was wounded and so he he was a corporal in this home guard and i i thought i'd joined him you see to help defend the country sir that's what i did and then a my father evacuated my mother and the younger children to northern ireland are to get away from the bombing and so there is only my sister my father left with and i decided well i'm going to be called up in any case shortly so i i decided to become a merchant seaman because we had sort of a a lot of relatives former relatives in at sea and my father worked for shipping company so we had long sort of connections to adolf i go to sea i'll also get a training for after the war you see i'll be a meta navy officer which i was when i left him but we with why the merson navy over the navy then well i couldn't join the navy at sixteen i have to be eighteen and during the navy did not necessarily mean you would have a professional job after the war whereas the matron navy i went as a midshipman or cadet and so i served an apprenticeship for three years than i graduated as a third officer so i i could have stayed on and got my masters eventually and stayed on as a master for a captain of a merchant ship you see so you are already quite a you know you had quite an ambition for very well i well as to try and see what could be done you know and cause during the war it was very difficult to make any decisions because people were being called up and did kno what's going to happen and didnt know here you going to stay alive and what was going to go on you know so and what was what was the process then for joining the merchant lady what did you have to do before you were given your first well you had to have your own levels first and fortunately i went to a secondary school because i got a scholarship and those days there very few secondary schools people left of the primary school at the age of fourteen so when i got my o levels i could have stayed on to do a levels but then what would happen and in any way i was glad to get out of the school because i didn't like it and what to do during the war so in my sister started working in a musician's place she was older than me a meccano they used to make little trains and think toys during the war they switch to a munitions and things like that you know and my father was also in the shipping company and that's the one i joined so it's a it was easy in that sense and what did you as you do i mean will you let she join up and then you were on a ship or was there a process no you went straight on a ship and clean out the builders on the first you see on a great thing about the in those days the martian navy ronan apprenticeship you did every job that the seamen would do even though our trained to be an officer and so the first morning i was on the ship we worked by the boson at six o'clock and no half past five in the morning come on lads had to go down the builders and clean the bulges out that was a training for an officer then you spend your time cleaning in the decks to painting and watch keeping and so on and lookouts and up the mast and all this kind of thing for three years it was four years just before the war but they cut a year off because of the a t want to get more officers through you see and so at the end of that in other words it was on the job training was an apprenticeship it wasn't just an academic program and so the semen you afterwards if you told him to do something you'd done it yourself sir there is no problem about will you don't know what's going on here that was the tradition i think it's very good tradition naturally and then all so am i got my sec mate certificate you needed that to be a third mate you see a third officer and then you had to spend another eighteen months watch keeping actually in charge of a watch before you could take the next the mate certificate another eighteen months before you take your master so it was all graded out and when i was in education in zimbabwe i used this for training social workers they had to have steps do a lot of practical work as well so it was a useful experience for me
