how long we income come late before you some time oh we were there i was there about twelve months were you there for v j day then now i was back here i was back here we we arrived out there round about christmas forty three and i left during christmas forty four and i i came back here about march no i was back here then in u k and then i next thing i i got a draft and back to sydney again was it i went on i went on the cruise of devonshire as a that was troop and crew with the devonshire steamed out and and we took over ship company and took her out and another crowd took over and steamed her back she was used like as a troop ship really and then when i got to sydney i stayed out there for two and a half years out around the far east because by that time as the end of the war i went out in august september i think just after v j day and then all the boys who had been retained in the navy at the end of the war some of them had all gone to pension in nineteen thirty nine nineteen forty they all had a group number then for d mob so we kept getting shifted round various ships ships were coming home and they were coming home ward with the with the boys ready for a discharge you know so as regulars we we say we had to stay around and go from one ship to another if the ship was coming home then you went on another ship and stayed there i i think i was away two and a half years and i was i had about seventeen ships in two and half years what was your favorite portico sidney was pretty good but but buying las during the war i mean it for going into rosset and going down to edinburgh there weren't a lot of other places we went we had to run ashore in quebec when we were out there but you couldn't get a drink there anyway you had to go into into a license place and pick up a a ticket to go and get to beer but we had we run ashore in in in in alexandra but but by and large we didn't get a lot of run good runs ashore you know because all all the places where where where the fleet ankerces where where there was a fleet anchorage it was miles away from anywhere you know i up in iceland or scapa flow or locke or or greenock weren't bad i suppose we had a couple of runs into there you could go up to glasgow but we when we only came into devenport one devenport ship only came into devenport once all during the war and was there any sign that you were terrified as very scary you scared no i couldn't i i i would say that there was no time really that i was scared no because you always had such good people around you you know when we were all young we're all young we're all under twenty we weren't afraid of ending in those days you know and you'll get all your mates and that they made a joke out most things you know and what's to be will be i suppose you know no i i i i don't remember i don't remember being scared at all really two things that she remembered tell me about these kittens most ships had a cat on board you know or or or or or or a mascot she had a cat or a dog or something like that yet we had a kitten because we had a lot of rats on board renown you know and there was a chap called marlow who was an able seaman and a and he was a country boy and he told the commander that he could that he would catch the rats so he was appointed as the rat catcher and he used to go round and he used to put up fuse wire snares all the way round the cable runs and things like that and then the that he had a report of the commander every morning to know how many rats he'd caught during the night need he'd get sixpence for each rat that he'd caught and do and then one morning he arrived up with half a dozen rats and the cap so take those bloody things out i don't want to see them and he was suffering from a bit of a hangover i think and another morning he arrived up and he he'd he'd found some rats and they were only baby ones you know they hadn't go he said to him i'm not paying you for those they haven't got any hair on em so he took em away and kept them in a box for a week until they grew hair and he brought them back again he got paid for them but you could be walking along in the ship cause it was dark in ship at night you know there was no light on new her and you what you could be walking along the upper deck and someone hit the end of it one of his rats hanging down on on the snare and the but the the there was quite a on the cats caught two money he he he caught a lot of them but to but then the cat was just you know it a ship's pet i think and he probably went ashore somewhere and came back in the next in there and the cat had kittens and so mary antelope one of the cat one of the kittens but but most ships i was on some were they had a dog or a parrot or a monkey or something you know there was a bit my hose ships had a musket of picked up something or or a dog or something and i ask you about it was am the plans that you had on board you tell me a bit about what they were what did you ever see them with the catapults or oh yes yes we had the the plans we had there were the wales sea plains and we launched them by catapult the fired and you fired a accorded charge and that blasted them off from the on the catapult deck which was aid ship freely and then the the plane could fly around for so long to run out of fuel and then he would land alongside and then there and you picked it up on a crane and re hoisted it back on board so it was love for it was carry for a spotter plane i suppose really you know but then you know but it with the advent of aircraft carrying an l a lot of aircraft carriers i think those sort of planes became redundant in half way through the war and our plans were to take was taken up quite a lot of room on board you know so the there were two hangers one was made into a mess deck and then the catapult deck could be used as a boat deck so i think about nineteen forty two the the the planes will declared sort of redundant to our needs and they were taken off and what was he like watching him god he's pretty good you know they just hear a bang and the next thing he's just gone was as to call him a purse duck that was that was a name and he wouldn't say it was but they were all wall wall ross sea plains and by window he went away and struggled away and then gained a bit of height or something but but that was the idea that they could go you know they're pretty brave boys five fellows and and in those days they they they had rating pilot pilot to get a petty officer who was a pilot of a plane they were they weren't all officers they they were in in the fleet there were some petty officers who were pilots that's neat but they need land alongside but you it would very dip dicey if you land alongside any bit of rough weather you know because you know to get the sling on at the thing on and get the crane over and get the crane and hoisted on board a bit of a dicey job really it wasn't very easy they they they they were a bit cumbersome but i suppose they served the purpose would there be much fun dishing in the arctic in the arno we never used them they never used them up there i don't they but but by an lads they were aircraft carriers up there you know they were nearly always aircraft carriers could but they they wouldn't be much used because the weather been so rough you wouldn't be all recover them really and it's a final question of the jumper and how do you reflect on your time in the navy now i say i enjoyed it really i we enjoyed all the friends i met you know and all the mates as i met you know he meets to give me so good guide you know and i ate i put up with a lot of things but i say bin large i enjoyed it didn't do him any harm i'm over ninety now so i'm still going along and able to drink my tot of rum still so there we are
