i served from nineteen forty one to nineteen forty five basically western approaches that includes plymouth right the way up to scotland top of scotland field i was joan rose circumstances to you well i actually was born in cambridgeshire and i think it was fifteenth century thatched cottage with my grandmother smallholding i was born there my parents worked on the smallholding in nineteen search ee sixty five thousand, five hundred and thirty five thirty four thirty four we moved to a new town of welwyn garden city when my father ring employment i live there went to school there i want a scholarship anniversary to sharon's wood high school it which is in welwyn garden city and i matriculated at which was patient i was in seventeen and i wanted to join with a walking broken out by then obviously i wanted to join the rounds i went down and help hopefully getting around if not i'll have to go into the wife but they accepted me into the rounds that i'm only taking on cooks and stuart which of course i did not want to do i have an eye test they decided i got perfect eyesight then and so i was told i was going to be a signal i didn't mean much to me but i didn't mind what it was and i was called up just once before christmas to hms cavalier which has happened warrington eighteen forty one and all the offices at christmas for waiting on a lovely idea this is because it was very tough you were given two weeks for what they call probation and you will give you a dirty jobs to do it over scrubbing the floors cleaner lose it was makeup breaktime quadrillion till skypro squad got to love it actually after that that's the end of the fortnite we were accepted some of them went home went awol if you went awol you just went into nations or whatever but if you didn't really like perhaps the westward of how we were first choice in those days everybody wanted to go in the range and so i started my visual signalling and coding i could do some coding as well but that's basically visual signalling and record lost it i think for six months six months after that time you went on leave you and then draught is different places we all paws put down for plymouth always comes tiles i'm good i left them in welwyn garden city obviously it so i don't even never even heard of it hard to find it on the map when i got the day off where it was this is there a little bit that you wanted to join i don't know no no no my father and my grandfather in the army i don't know what it was i i love to see maybe the uniform it's direct don't really know but i always wanted to be in the rings it was just something i think it's definitely had the same when we her book is attraction to it i suppose in a way it's a grammar of the rhone but i'd like to know a bit more about what you were learning and how you learnt visualisation and what what you know what was the process in the morse code even at seventeen that's a bit tricky but your love morse code and that is absolutely drummed into your postcode and you going gimmicks twenty ft to remind you put into classes and the visual signals this class is all began with the v and my class was verity and i can't remember it's stephanie's classes which is also mentioned in the book the wireless it all began with dump you like water pipes banging coding classes all beginning with a c em in and each course was in different lengths and morse code semaphore signal with flags you know i would like the old nelson signal which kept changing learning of kinetic half of which halfway through our changed so the americans could understand it which annoyed that's why i should be able to change after all these years anyway so the phonetic alphabet the class was man by an ex serving man usually he would never dealt with whipping before and some of little bit tough but we need it because we were completely raw to it all we only without enable discipline and different time watches you know how to twenty four hour clock which we haven't started to use them the basics really basics and i found it quite enjoy it was just like being at school really british spartan we're not too bad it was old nissan hats i think they've been used and i think men should definitely i think you'll be used by the post office about your all old nissan hearts on his big site at newton just outside warrington and is now being developed into a big housing but it was a very large camp mostly but they were also the men on board as well they were doing wt but we were obviously been trying to take over some of the signal stations from the men to release them which we haven't afterwards obviously so i coughed up to open your parents and you say by me where is that how did you get there a bit stang every moment my mother my father is my father took me up to euston station i got this draft report today i suppose it was so patrol police often used then i was sent off when i go from king's king's cross ons military style only allowed to take a suitcase of clothes eleven outfit of civic close and then the usual pyjamas always pyjamas the usual sort of things are we going into hospital only one says civilian clothes and to report to this place in the in the stations it i think it was kings cross and they took me under their wing and sorted me out and got me onto the train my father saw me off of that was really all i ended up i thought wherever i am i going in because quite a few sailors on going up to going back on the and they will come out what was happening the train was crowded i can remember we couldn't sit down anywhere and one of the sales put me up onto the top of the rack at the talk to i could have a sleep remember that we got to carlisle it was an air raid warning and we had to stay in carlisle siding for about an hour which i had missed my train from carlisle to stirling where i had to change again so that was another problem for sterling and corsa trying to open has gone so i was stranded obviously has put me up in a hotel or hostel for the night and i went down to help and report it to oban to the officer in charge of auburn and was told i was going to repair signal station in the morning i'm going to the pier signal station i'm in the meantime i thought i've been kitted out when we were kissing up i didn't have any bell bottoms that is essential for a rib the azran because it's so cold so i was issued with bell bottoms and the next day went on duty you're happy and i thought this is crazy all this or business cabra strict discipline table disappears nobody seems to be bothered open it i don't think you think they realise there was a war on except for the corsa convoys come again i like i like i like scotland stephanie don't like it if you ever read it she just didn't seem to mixing very well with scottish people but i have got a scottish grandfather preps so accept it more and i realise that they're a bit insular and they didn't mean to be off putting but they were when it isn't innocent end up in the highlands i don't know whether you know that and it's very well there are until themselves the little bit about what what the face was like what what your surroundings like where you slept all the station hotel and the signal station on the pier was only a short walk away and i met up with a girl who is going to work with me she's been there about a week we haven't yet started really getting the convoys in so we were told was going to happen but the convoys would come in and i'll be in a bay and we had to all and we weren't allowed to go on any boats that's another story we had to monitor everything coming in and out we also had to look after funny enough raf had this sunderland's and catalinas up there and they had a call sign which change every hour and half of them could never ever read it so we used to have to read tesco signal for them to send the patrol boat out but that was bit unbeknown to our base who never had clue what was going on it a crazy set up really and submarines on patrol duty used to come in along side of here we have to give them their signals and they were patrol that was mostly what we were doing at a signal station but this wasn't adequate enough and gavin signal station which was right round the corner from where we were still manor by the men and they also had a new aztec centre opening up just below radar and i was sick and john barrowman and the men were going from jonathan and they were going over to this more it rains going to be completely alone up there is no no it was no inhabitation or take a few for few sheep farmers so will you allowed out in your small that's where that photograph is taken over twenty body so the caravan signal station was going to help me not and we were going to go there which meant very great difficulty because from the station hotel in it was about three miles to three miles in the middle of the night that's no it's booked till eventually about i was saying about a months before the caravan was oppa gangnam signal station with then opened up for the rounds and we took over from the men lenamore vs france six of us instead of four and we took over caravan from the mend and very very spartan when we're at the pier signal station tables have meals with in a mess proper meals nightwatch my sandwiches remove from a signal station to signal station we were stationed at a place called rossi lodge which was very tough going and they don't like watchkeepers because they couldn't handle nearly all your whole renary was writers or wt operators who works properly wash out they were nine hundred and twenty five not us we had to do it watchkeeping hours same as the navy so we if you are lucky you get hot hot dinner if you didn't you just have a sardine sandwich so your food was pretty spot if you're reading a book people my friends with read the book so why did you stand it but i said that there was a war and we didn't know any different we had to go to it without the men very very sparse signal station we want to describe it to it the signal station itself was the top of a caravan on just by john holly holly house which is the house of the lord and lady i think they were called yes i was on the island and it has been built as a lookout post i think originally for the coast guards it was a very sparse it was it to a place to catch you it was a climb up a cliff almost a sheer cliff the road went belouis and this year clip up which we had to carry the oldest lamp batteries which was very heavy then we had to have a coal fire because we had to be able to burn any confidential books which we had if anything if we had any kind of and we had to put the books and his nose help because they were led lighting it was safe but we as well we had the far we had a bump down below and a signal up the top and it can you around we had a big ten inch at three or discounts and it was really just go just pushed it will depend where she got it right front we can see mole right the radio antrim all over to lose more we had perfect vision of everything it was coming and going because it was very safe they thought they could come in it was if you have a look at the map is a complete bay and tobermory the escort ships destroyers would drop the convoy off and go up to tobermory there we go up to it up the sound and if you can visualise that coastline mullis protects today so there's any ships passing have to go round behind the mall they don't realise is coming in and have a story about the duke of york i think it was a very safe haven and they came in they were escorted off from us probably down to go into the crowd for unloading or they would mass up ready to go out as either and x eta of arrival or unexpected time of dispatch they will either coming or going old harbour whitby full i would say thirty one is thirty and of course you tell her to have a list and unfortunately you know using or might be a straggler but they were never came that was a terrible thing you think when wonder what happened to that one we have quite a lot of losses unfortunately not in a built in the bay but you know coming and going because we have to have a listen to us which was a confidential list and expected time of arrival and you give them about two or three hours and never came in just one what happened and they were all man by louis so there wasn't very good but now and again you get a ship which had a few united states in america came in it was better planned you know the liberty ships came in and they will a little bit overpowering really because it was so shall i say this over clever that used to send more so the rate of knots thinking that we couldn't answer it then we were at the same rate this is what i didn't like the americans very much i'm afraid they tried all sorts of things i try to have another station we couldn't have them in not allowed to have them in the head why not your problem with people coming up one night i could hear footsteps coming up with singing and knock on the door and i thought this race i didn't under who it was a man's voice we already have a metre round murders in terraria vs rennes murdered out inveraray on nightwatch so we were all very welcome we all were taught how to handle a pistol the range which was the raf had a range and we were taken onto the range by an instructor and talk to fire a pistol night very small wrists and i was taught to fire holding my wrist so i could follow we also have arrival of the signal station it wasn't dowager's know i'm in it for the pistols work but this rifle wasn't it was just there as as a warning i heard it's true her this footsteps coming up and i said to my oppo i don't like this very much so this but in the end i got this right and i thought nikon and i don't know what we're going to do the other way and boys came through the thing i've left it up and going to clock in my head was it he said it's alright john it's only me and it the six months from down below stupid who's got a date i had changed watches with a girl is really he always used to come up for a cup of tea and have a cup of tea with her he thought she was on watch and only got himself killed and it would have been quite in my rights because we've got a great big for herbert innosense up with the door but never ever came to anything and i never ever reported it because i have got him into terrible trouble but we were armed but only way the pistol arrival is no admission because we had a rent in inveraray i don't know all that is a need to know you never ever told what happened we were just told to be very aware and i'll take extra precautions and i think i've messaged stephanie mentioned as well we never ever knew what happened are we had a what we thought was a spider a man use to come down it was all prohibited than four civilians well this man you to come down on the rocks awake to the convoys and you have not considered a camera we were not allowed to take photographs of the convoys we could take the photographs around and around the same but not allowed to be reported this man to our headquarters in a cigarette back in the station hotel nothing ever happens about it sweetie just disappeared now whether it was just a local newspaper man or whether he was us or well he was just interested in ship we never heard see what i'm afraid in need to know you never ever told they wanted to come up for signal station look like honey we've got some nylons or honey we've got noise on board it i mean it's so stupid and childish we took a dislike to the what we didn't like was the way they used to treat their offices complete disrespect it would call them by their first names which we thought was terrible and the captain's officers never seem to take any notice we were in oban one day shopping and americans were came on board payment policy shopping as well and with us for a cup of coffee ok fine which they do we talking to the ymca and helical coffee going back some of their offices the other way we were appalled the way they spoke to know saluting hiya hiya cat is terrible i can't describe another world away and they were trying to bribe as with bananas and nylons and we just didn't we thought it was too childish very fast flashing moss different types of communication or sometime by rt nearly always vrt we really only used for the aztecs station lamp mostly the oldest and all the big ten inch which was of course a handle you like to go out on and of course it up there the windsor always at gale force we always had two tones for the width of the weather every day we had two choices icon voice to know what the weather was that your voice is it from greenland south rim very primitive but they gave them some idea of a weird win i mean up and you could tell the way with win with brown just look at the end had to fry the white innocent and we had to buy by the colours of the white ensign put it up at sunrise and down at somerset so the edison was always flying so you could always tell which way going without my account but it was a gale force wind we should put the cone up which sometimes meet the comas up the days with the girls would blow up there very windy and sometimes we would have to be latched onto the ten because it was so windy you keep being thrown away it was very very very very we were always wet situated well the night watch was a long one we go on something like eight and come off at eight the next morning that was a very long one the other watches pretty well for arizona for either of the night watch was with a tough one because of men in essex ocean down below for transport it will work in the same watches orwell yes ok then they decided they would issue was with bicycle which they do we had a rent officer came up to see us and she said this isn't good enough and then they supplied transport for us so we didn't have to walk the night sweats and three or four miles in a pitch dark along the coast road at first of all we have to report a realise it was happening there's a story about the duke of york we never had the very big ships the biggest ship ever really came into us destroyers converts because i always used to go into mulled to wait for the convoy to go back out so we never really had anything what i would call a large i was on watch this particular occasion and it if you can a picture of the islands in the sea and suddenly you see it a great big cross across mouse coming actually you have no idea of what it could possibly be we had no eta for anything we had nothing whatever is it was moving very sorry i got bigger and bigger we can't believe it because it was called it up and no reply because that was worrying no reply to this is a special everyday every hour they changed the call out sign for changed and a codebook you would call them up by the code which it was thursday and no reply so we had a little ship we had chips actually one was called the falcon star mum was called the chalon way they were patrol ships which was too patrol backwards and forwards a mannequin what is all the time they were old i was cool something like a corvette old troll they were man by navy and they were at what if any trouble we call them up immediately and we called at the southern star she was my way out over more and also what it was all about he said i can't see anything from here because they would be great if it's anything trouble i'll put a shop across its bowels got bigger and bigger eventually i managed to call up but obviously that's what visual signals are called dancing classes was asleep i should think he's always around these islands and he came back quickly with d of why instead cannot numbers because all ships have planet numbers by the pennant number of the ship or in a coma beach came back with nothing quickly dry and i said to stephanie of what she look of york battleship i said your base don't know it's very quickly phone dial base they don't believe us because nobody has got an eta anyway captain captain who came rushing down took him about half an hour to get to us by which time she was in full view it just filled up the whole of never seeing if you like it and course of the great big who are about this why didn't we know of course she was on pilgrimage to norway after and she was doing this to we got time to do it i don't know why they did it they were way of course she must have known the way very welcome it's very dangerous but she said she came from another show you exactly where she was more than that she just appeared by the island as if it was on some kind of a film it was incredible and it's sort of seeing you enjoy dream about happy story lovely story but nobody ever really again need to know whenever he found out we realised afterwards what it was all about she run away up to the battle in norway drink of tea d day we had all the ships we couldn't understand it why they look so tread for all sorts of battleships what we are seeing some awful sites for about fifty fifty of them with two destroyers durban and something else urban maybe i've written maybe she mentioned in the book and destroyed it was terrible stay surely and even though there is no idea what they were they came in i suppose it in about a week enough time for stephanie to get to know this and smp ten days we still couldn't understand why they went so why they didn't because they only ever stayed for three days but they seem to be a long time low something's going on then all our which are we not allowed to post any more letters or letters will be cancelled all their postage out with everything going out from the base with to be stopped and we'll all evil stop mistletoe something's in the air that you get that whistle where they going what we're going to do of course over the block ships night before dj they say didn't know what they were doing they had no idea what it's all about also they said the night before they will seem to be getting ready the night before a big ship came along side some of them and took off a lot of stuff we thought i don't usually unload it goes to look but they won't loading allsorts herself and watch them through the telescope chairs and tables and what sort of things are coming out understand this no no next day we could bring we came up on watch it with all busy getting ready to go out we had no spoke to time of departure at all they all just sent it and how to patrol ships had no idea they said what do we do where they're going where will we have them because it's a secret and that's the end of the day that's all the blocks they will ships and nobody wanted the two destroyers have been so battle scar but they were almost unthinkable thinkable so they were the two big drop ships and st john's wort help out we never ever heard until the end of the war but was all about these are obviously there with a block ships did talk about this documentation can you just explain again for me you know how the a dispatch rider with arrived from base station hotel which is their base search bride with arrived with a confidential letter which which contain eta of convoy come here and right so you don't get it out for you in front of you put it up and wait for the first one l to come in with et eighty nine hundred and eleven start to come in till onine three hundred and eight obviously being march i suppose i think from ireland they were there and sort of march across so we'll get the eta of them across that was literally how we got this eta is from of dispatch rider confidential letter with come i suppose about every if i'm coming quite regularly at least once a month coming but they told me how to get the babies always really it was chock a block and of course i got little what i got the raf but it's that was in forwards with the sunderland and then catalina so it was quite a busy little harbour and every single thing has to be longer and longer out identified and put down so you could have to be on watch pretty well aware what was going on all around you in the air with the catalinas this is why we had to have southern wave and southern start have youtube they were also signalling and trying to get them it would really like a great big herd of sheep until shepherds trying to it was it could have been organised chaos but it wasn't very good very good it's always worked it just really shepherding these ships still quite big son that you would renew renew a chat one we had an identification of each one so we could make them off if not we got that everyone's name very long but yes we had identification for our of them you had to concentrate quite hard when they were coming in you couldn't extension one hundred yeah you gotta be so quick festival when it first happened what happened to there is only hope they're alright but this time you've done it for about a year or so you just accept what do you what do you do you don't know what's happened to them you never know what's happening gay you got this need to know we were to try and find out we're never ever told you being struck off somewhere you think i want to how far they got what happens when a man and what happened to all that lovely stuff that was coming in i'm going out i don't you just don't know he just a new and you just had to accept whatever was happening just and leave it put all your sort of personal feelings aside because it would worry about it cause what could you do remember of ve day dj on watch remember much about it as we have been scotland we were invited to a big parade in edinburgh which we did take part in later on but the big we thought we get there is a journey from oban to edinburgh minutes you just don't get on your bike go you got i don't remember no we just had a party that was all we have a party i think we were we will never allowed to have the rum and rum recipe to go on ships who's coming in waves to get a total from the hated it like it very much because after the war the royal naval association for child and i was vice chairman of the new branch of the royal naval association and they always often too hot and too far it for me so we don't really just the top of rum and a knees up in the in the bass the end of the end of the world where was the end of the war i was at tower point in dunoon because i was as the convoys when no longer needed we win a somatic stephanie went to ireland i went to tower point dunoon to hms brontosaurus and the ships coming back down the clyde and that was where i spent bjj there again and just another knees are really you can't be too much more about it and from there i was in the rain is on bbc two from the witcher wednesday more because i was wanting to go on a social services course so i don't really mind up what i wanted you away i regret now not staying in i thinking away but it's happening in work i like that how do you reflect on it all now then enjoyed it it was an experience of course i never have a gain and nobody would ever have a go because it will never happen like that again i enjoyed my time up there i love the highlands
