just in terms of the rescue how does a ship do this rescue what are you using to help this rescue process well you stop first of all and if necessary you lower your own lifeboats and go and help people in the water if like we had another lifeboat was lowered off that ship and was coming toward us and then you put scramble nets over the side these are big huge nets that are normally used for lifting cargo but people can climb up them more easily than up a rope ladder and more people can get on them so you can get more people on board and then you give them whatever you can food clothing whatever the ship we had no doctor on board we just had to do what you could you know but we weren't officially rescue ships we were just designated rescue ships because we didn't have all the facilities of a hospital ship for instance when we were in the area of great intensity the passengers all had to help as well they were on lookout all these twelve people were round the ship looking out for submarines so they didn't get away with it the crew they had work to do all hands on deck one of the rather funny things on the convoys was that normally when we left england in one particular part of the war we were all given a barrage balloon it was from the mast and then it went up a trawler used to come round like the balloon man with all these balloons you see and give you one they were small barrage balloons you see and the idea was to stop dive bombers who would come down they were about five hundred feet up you know but when you got into a strong wind they would blow away or become deflated they weren't a great success then we had all kinds later on in the war we had all kinds of weird and wonderful rocket things which weren't very safe but the ship was armed better against aircraft than against submarines we had oerlikon guns and on one ship had bofors but fortunately we didn't have an aircraft attack on our ship it was always submarines but one particular period when we were sailing on our own off west africa we saw a cruiser coming up so we put on our top speed which was about fourteen knots and manned the gun you know our gun would have been hopeless anyway and this huge ship came up and of course we couldn't get away from it but it was a free french cruiser and it just circled around us waved and went off you know but it could have been a german raider that's what we were worried about but if it had been a raider we couldn't have done anything we had a four seven gun which is an anti submarine gun quite a big shell but it wouldn't have been any good it wouldn't fire very far the cruiser and other naval ships how come you didn't use these four sevens when you had the subs following you well they were mounted on the stern you see not on the bows the americans put some of their merchant ships on the prow as well to be defensive legally it was supposed to be one on the stern so you could defend yourself and not be used for attacking you see because we weren't a war ship war ships had them forward they could use them for attacking but we were not allowed to do that by international law so you had all these subs following you and you weren't allowed to they were out of range for us we couldn't have shot that far if they came up during the daytime astern of us we could have had a pot shot at them but they knew that they couldn't do that and then when they came at night as i mentioned before our gun was no use because we couldn't fire across the lines in case we hit the other ship next door to us you see what they were saying that the royal naval officers were gentlemen but not seamen the merchant navy officers are seamen but not gentlemen what about big seas and stuff big storms and what have you do you remember any horrific ones big swells ah yes i remember one time we were on our own and for three days we couldn't go ahead the waves were so big that we were up down and over them like that and you could see them over the top of the mast as the ship went down this one you looked up and the next wave was coming up that way now what you do in those situations is you go dead slow on your engines you ride them if you go full ahead you go right through them and they swamp you even so you get quite a bit over i mean i know that we used to carry railway engines on deck sometimes for west africa and one of our ships same line was in a storm with one of these on the deck and it broke loose and was running up and down the deck eighty zero ended up in the dining room now it was very difficult sometimes because i remember on one occasion we had a storm not as bad as that one but we were in a storm and we had oil drums on deck and they broke loose they were tied up with wire and they were sliding around the deck and it was very dangerous we had to try to go down and get them into position and the deck was covered with oil as well it was a bit difficult job to do that but we finally secured it but it wasn't very easy did you see the lady in white in durban yes she came out with her choir in durban and sang for us as we entered it was very very nice in those days durban was very colonial you know that was when we were going to india tell me about that trip that trip well it was interesting because when we left south africa to go across the indian ocean the admiralty asked us to take two of their small mine sweepers now they were too big to put on the deck so we had to shepherd them they didn't want to go on their own in case they couldn't make it they were wooden mine sweepers so we went like a shepherd with two sheep right across the indian ocean and i remember in calcutta i was in hospital for three days because i got sort of dengue fever there so that was the highlight of that on another occasion in madras we took on coal indian coal because we were coal burning on that particular ship and when we went out next day at sea it was on fire in the holds combustion so we had to go back to port to get it all taken out one very interesting thing was the fire brigade came down and of course it was in colonial times then and the chief fire officer was a white man and he had a beautiful white uniform and a gold braided cap you see and he went down into the hold with all his firemen to try to sort this fire out you see into the bunkers and he fell down one of the chutes there were coal chutes down to the stoke hold you see he came up his beautiful white uniform was completely black and he had lost his cap when we changed the coal and got new coal in we went off again and then a few days later one of the african we had african stokers on that ship he appeared on deck with this commodore's cap on we had a lot of amusing incidents as well
