and then you are you i mean you you were the last person of but are you working alone or as the other people and you sort have a part of it now you trying to talk to people and say do him all through the sky and and what have you or was it was a little just going from man to man to see what you could do as well i was just go on to man i mean if i saw some er i did say to her some lads how can you get him off while i was treating someone else and at the time i was only a private but some of them listen to me because i had been a lance corporal before so i was still a i still had that i still giving orders even i was a private i was telling people to do things cause some it needs doing you see over see need to get these get these soldiers off as quick as possible really out the way of the danger and at that was the main priorty really and so once you've got on his may flow then and you'll thought away what what happens next a t m i took us to land and i did just you are there a few now's a fevers on board and that he took a few of us back we got on to land and water and i managed i managed to find our unit and that em he'd set up some tentage and had casualties and there and that we had casualties which had been a of see some of them had been up would a bit of sea were flown and dropped off at land so that they were dropped off not far from where we where we were you see cause we were in an inlet and at which was fitzroy beer but they say it was a i'm trying to think now they that i think i was propaganda you see because they were saying that beset was in some other area when it wasn't em saw a bluff cove that's why is bluff cave that the said the ship the ships had been hit in but he was in her i was in fits roy beer and so of see the helicopters had dropped off the cases are on land then gone back to the ship and and there's all these tents the water and to this day i don't know how or why i am i had about two hundred cigarettes on me i had not long beforehand and had bought some duty free cigarettes a box or two hundred and instead of leaving well there we need enough to undreathing and i i base had them in me combat trousers and that and a cause but i didn't have me combat jacket because that was still in the hall and whatever with all my equipment and whatever so i was going on with cigarettes to these casualties and even some of the lads as well and that so to this day and that cause cosesi used to split them up you see some but put some in your web in and put some in your combat jacket put some in your trousers and then put some in the main one that met the rest in bergen a that i could you see the gulags to he was the in san not for not turnout star a flat or not am i and and we were waiting late on a night for a helicopter to pick us up i've seen the survivors in that and am so it became dark and all is up and it was more vivid than you could see the flames coming from the ship and it and em and when i was thinking myself i saw how did i get off that and am and then a sea king picked us up and took us to others i think i was still at falklands sound and the em and though when we we got a re a message from the crew at the front to say that we were either going on the nordic ferry which which i knew anywhere from the crew and everything else or the intrepid anywhere they decide to land us on the intrepid which i thought oh my uncle's here so we're all we're all chaperoned into the galley and i saw my uncle in the corner well i was the chief engineer on the year on the intrepid and he was he was he was in the corner of the galley on the other end so i went i said to me are sam a said or excuse you sir is it all right to say my uncle he said uncle i suggest sir i said my uncle's on board this ship he said well bring him over here the ha ha ha ha to meet me in that so so my arse met my uncle and night after my uncle said what the f you doing here something and i say i've just been just come off the gallad and that so and he helped me a few bits anywhere tried to get some washing shaving stuff for us and that for me to get the lads and all this in and he got me a few read his digest magazines as well so the lads could have something to read however and what were you doing so i mean i think he had some rest so then and then you talked early about the attempt was quite a frightening place to be is that you think that was because you've been in you'd been struck already or was it just because there was more aerial now i think it's cost of the explosions probably from the ship from the galahad the explosion from the galahad i see put us all up and put our nerves up a bit and so how are you in on the intrepid and what was the next thing i think we're on board there for about probably a day and a half and then we got flown to me jacksper to the red and green life machine and and we report there in the red and green life machine and a sort of given a floor space so we could sleep on which was next to some argentinian prisoners of war which the marines were looking after me and we got er we they managed to give us so much a kit back some arctic kit as well to survive and then we were flown to fitzroy to meet the rest of our unit up there in a advanced dressing station and then what we did was i i i was living in a i was living in the shops a shop's attic the fitzroy car settlements there their shop we lived in their settlement in their in their attic for a little while and whatever and then there was a lot of action stations so we had to go in under this pit in under this in into this i trench covered by pete i don't think it would a protector as much and ununtil it was all clear again and em and then we were fairy in patience but we gon as escorts with the casualties are to er the red and green life machine near jackspear i was on the helicopter every now and again with some casualties are looking out to watch looking after them while before they were on the war there a night then be then being flown back to fitzroy then we lived in a small tent after that for a little while and on stretches plus sir that was when it was more less sir we had no casualties then it was more less clear to let us have that accommodation and and then we went in then we settled went into one of the settlements sir houses after that which he had a nice hot bath in there which we all appreciated ha ha ha and that
