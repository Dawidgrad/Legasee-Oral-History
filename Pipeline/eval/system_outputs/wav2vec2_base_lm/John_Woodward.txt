MY NAME IS JOHN DOUGLAS WOODWARD I AM EIGHTY NINE YEARS OLD I WAS BORN ON THE SET OF APRIL NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR WHEN IN THE SERVICE I HAD ORIGINALLY JOINED TO BE A SIGNALLER AND THEY FOUND OUT I WAS COLOUR BLIND SO I WAS AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE STEWARDING BRANCH WHICH I DIDN'T WANT BUT YOU HAD NO CHOICE YOU DID WHAT YOU WERE TOLD AND I GOT TRANSFERRED TO MINE SWEEPERS AND I WAS BASED ON THE ISLAND SHIP HERE AT QUEENS BORG AT QUEENSLAND QUEEN WERE PEER AND WE HAD ABOUT TO TEN MIND THREE BE THERE AND WE WENT OUT EVERY CUP OF DAYS TO SWEEP ANY MIND THAT HAD BEEN DROPPED BY THESE BOATS IN THE HOPE OF SINKING OUR SUPPLY SHIPS NOW WHY DID YOU DO IN THE NAVY BECAUSE I WANTED A GIVEN IN THE FIGHT I DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND AT THE TIME I WAS I WAS THEY CALL IN A RESERVED OCCUPATION I WAS AN APPRENTICE AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER AND MY DAD DIDN'T WANT ME TO THEM TO JOIN UP HE WAS IN THE LAST WAR AND HE WOULD PREFER ME TO LEARN A GOOD STEADY TRADE BUT I WANTED TO GO SO AS SOON AS I WAS EIGHTEEN I WENT OVER FROM MAIDSTONE WHERE OUR HOME WAS I CAME OVER TO CHATHAM TO PEMBROKE BARRACKS AND AND SIGNED UP I SAID I WAS NINETEEN BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE A I JUST ACCEPTED YOU IF YOU COULD BREATHE IN OUT AND MOVE YOUR ARMS YOU WERE PHYSICALLY FIT I'VE TOLD TO GO HOME AND WAIT AND I'D BE CONTACTED AND ABOUT A WEEK LATER THE ON BOOK CAME REPORTS OF CHATHAM BARRACKS OF SATAN SUCH A DAY I WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE WAR WITHOUT ACTUALLY SEEING A GERMAN WE HAD A LONG RAGED FIGHTS WITH THEM BUT THEY ACTUALLY SAW A GERMAN BUT JOHN WHAT WHY DIDN'T YOU KNOW YOU WANTING TO DO YOUR BIT BUT WHY DID YOU NOT DOING THE ARMY OR THE AREA NOT INTERESTED EITHER AT A TRADITIONAL FAMILY MY FATHER WAS IN THE NAVY SO AS MY GRANDFATHER AND AN UNCLE MY GRANDFATHER WAS ON BATES FLAGSHIP THE LION AT THE BATTLE OF JAPAN AND HE DIDN'T COME ON DECK FOR THREE DAYS HE WAS IN THE ENGINEERING BRANCH BUT THAT'S THE SERVICE I WANTED TO JOIN SO I DID WHAT DO YOU MEMBER OF YOUR TRAINING A RATHER IT'S RATHER CONFUSED WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG YOU DON'T AND TAKE THESE IN SO EASILY BUT FROM PEMBROKE HOUSE PEMBROKE BARRACKS WE WERE ALL MARCHED DOWN TO THE EAR FURTHER DOWN THE YARD WOULD BE GOT FITTED OUT AT THAT TIME EVERYONE A LESS OF AN ARTS OF WAR THE SAME FOREIGN ART RIG WITH BELL BOTTOMS THE SCARF AND THE AND THE THE HAT SENT UP TO SKEGNESS WITH ANOTHER BUNCH TO BUTLINS HOLIDAY CAMP AND THAT BECAME ACES ROYAL ARTHUR AND I WAS TO START AND TRAINING THE TELEGRAPHIST SIGNALLER AND I'VE BEEN DOING MORSE CODE JUST STARTED ON THE MORSE CODE FOR ABOUT A FORTNIGHT THEN SOMEBODY SAID ALL THIS THE LOT HAVEN'T HAD A THE COLITIS THE BETTER HAVE IT MOST ON PAST BUT TWO OTHERS AND ME WE'RE ALL STRONGLY COW BLIND SO YOU'RE OUT IF YOU SEND THE WRONG COLOURS WHEN YOU'RE SIGNALING IT COULD BE A DISASTER SO THAT'S WHEN I WAS TRANSFERRED ON TO MINE SWEEPERS ON THE STEWARDING BRANCH WILL YOU GET ACQUAINTED YES NOBODY LIKED BE ON MICE FEVERS WE ALL KEPT PUTTING IN FOR TRANSFER TO SOMETHING MORE GLAMOROUS DESTROYERS SUBMARINES EMPTY BEES ENG BEES BUT ALWAYS GOT TURNED DOWN YOU'RE DOING IMPORTANT JOB YOU WILL STAY PUT AND THAT WAS IT MANY PEOPLE ONE OF THESE NIGHTS WE WHAT WAS THE BOAT LIKE AH FIVE OFFICERS AND ABOUT TWELVE FIFTEEN CREW THAT INCLUDES THE THE ENGINEERS CALLED A STOKE OF BRANCH AS HE CALLED IT SIGNALING AND AND THOSE DOING THE ACTUAL MIND DETECTING WHEN WE FIRST STARTED WENT OUT MINE SWEEPING IT WAS A THREE DAYS ON ONE DAY OFF AND WE HAD TWO SEAMEN STANDING IN THE BOUGHS WITH RIFLES WHEN THEY SAW A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING BY THEY'D SHOOT AT IT HIT THE HORNS AND BLOW IT UP BUT THAT WAS WHEN THEY AND STARTED THE MINE SWEEPING CAMPAIGN AND THEY GERMANS WHEN THEY DROP THEM HAD LONG WAITS ON WIRES SO THEY JUST FLOATED BELOW THE SURFACE TO HIT THE SHIP IF ONE OF THOSE WIRES CAME LOOSE THE MINE WOULD BOB ON THE SURFACE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOKED FOR EACH TIME WE WENT OUT WHEN THE GERMANS OCCUPIED FRANCE OF COURSE GOT RIGHT ON THE COAST LINE AND THEY HAD BIG GUNS AT CAP GRINER AND USED TO POP AWAY THUS EVERY TIME WE CAME OUT BUT FORTUNATELY WE NEVER GOT IT THERE WAS ONE AND A MUSIC ANECDOTE OR COMMODORE HAD BEEN A A SENIOR CAPTAIN BEFORE THE WAR AND HE RETIRED OF COURSE THAT HE WAS BROUGHT BACK IN AND MADE COMMODORE OF THE MIND SAVING FLEET HE HAD HIS TWELVE MINE SWEEPERS AND WE USED TO DO THE SAME THING EVERY DAY A GERMAN'S BEING VERY METICULOUS WOULD COME OUT WILL SAY FRIDAYS AND CHOOSES NOT ONLY THE SAME DAY BUT AT SAME TIME TO LAY THEIR MINDS AND THEN DASHED BACK IN AND WE WENT OUT THE FOLLOWING MORNING EACH TIME TO PICK EM UP AND THE SKIPPER GOT A BIT FED UP WITH THIS AND THEN I TOLD THE CONFERENCE OF HIS CAPTAINS ONE DAY IS THE NEXT TIME WE GO SWEEPING RUN YOUR TROLLS OUT BUT DON'T DROP WILL YOU WIRES WHICH IS OF COURSE CONTRE ALL NAVAL INSTRUCTIONS THAT HE COULD HAVE GOT COURT MARTIAL IF ANY HAPPENED BUT WE WENT THROUGH THE GERMAN MINE FIELD AS THEY LAID IT AND WE GOT AWAY WITH IT SO THE GERMANS CAME OUT AGAIN TO REPLACE THE MINES THEY THOUGHT WE'D PICKED UP AND THEY LOST FOUR OF THEIR OWN BOATS ON THEIR OWN MINDS AND I DON'T THINK THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY SPORTY THAT DOCUMENT IT COMMENTED SOMEWHERE IN THE ADMIRALTY ARCHIVES OR THEY THINK THAT I DID HE COULD HAVE GOT INTO A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR THAT WHAT WAS YOUR WELL WHAT WOULD YOU DO WHEN WE WENT OUT I WAS A DUE TO REPORT WITH SIX OTHER STEWARDS WE REPORTED TO THE FIRST LIEUTENANT WERE DAMAGE CONTROL PARTY IF THE SHIP GOT HIT WE HAD TO CLEAR THE DAMAGE WAY PUT OUT AN E FIRES AND PULL THE WOUNDED INTO THE WAR ROOM WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS WAITING TO DO WHAT HE COULD BUT FORTUNATELY IT NEVER HAPPENED BUT THAT WAS MY OFFICIAL STATION AND WHAT ABOUT BAD WEATHER STORMS AND STUFF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY DANGERS WHEN YOU HAD WHAT ANY STORMS OUT WHERE THE BIG SEAS OR WE HAD SOME YEARS BUT WE STILL WENT OUT OU JUST PUT ON YOUR SOUTH WESTERN AND THAT WAS IT WE HAD SAFETY LINES RIG FOREIGN OUT SO YOU YOU HOLD ON TO THOSE YOU WOULDN'T GET WASHED OVERBOARD WHAT ABOUT WHAT DID YOU WAS IT WAS IT WHAT WAS IT LIKE WATCHING THE PLANES TAKING GOING OVER YOU IN THAT DID YOU SEE MUCH ACTIVITY IN THE AIR WE WENT TO FORT IN WE NEVER GOT ATTACK FROM THE AIR I DON'T THE GERMANS SOUGHT OUR LITTLE BOATS WERE WORTH WASTING A BARMAN THEY WANTED HIM FOR OF THE CAPITAL CITIES ALL THE AIR FIELDS WE INVOLVED INDEED AT YES NOW A WEEK BEFORE D DAY THE BASE WAS SHUT DOWN LIKE AN OYSTER NOWHERE YOU COULD GO OFF YOU NO ONE WAS ALLOWED IN BUT SECURITY REASONS OBVIOUSLY YOU COULDN'T GET ANY POST YOU COULDN'T MAKE ANY FOE CALLS BECAUSE IT WAS COMING UP ALTHOUGH OFFICIALLY WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT UNDER FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS BEFORE DE THEY ON APPLETON TRUCKERS BRIDGE STARTED NIGHT SWEEPING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DAY SHIFT SO THE GERMANS WOULD GET USED TO THE IDEA AS POPPING ALONG THE COAST DURING THE HOURS OF DOUBTLESS THEY WOULD BE ANY OF IT SO THE EARLY MORNING D DAY WE WENT OUT AT MIDNIGHT AND WE WERE SWEEPING RIGHT UP TO THE LINE WHERE THE BATTLESHIPS WERE WAITING TO BOMBARD THE COAST WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE STATIONED AND WE SWEPT THAT MOST CAREFULLY AND THEN WE AS THEY STARTED COMING ABOUT OF THE DARKNESS FROM TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WAITING AND WE RETIRED BEHIND THEM THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE FOR US TO DO WE GOT SENT BACK HERE TO THE ISLE OF CHEVY WHEN THE TROOPS WENT ASHORE WE WERE A BIT ANNOY CAUSE WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING AND THEN AND ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE DAYS LATER AS GIVER GOT THE ORDERS TO AND PATROLLED THE DUTCH COAST ON THE SHELF AND PICK UP ALL THE MIND WHICH THE GERMANS HAD SOWN LIBERALLY ROUND ALL THE COAST THERE SO THAT KEPT AS BUSY FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS AND WE WERE STATIONED AT A LITTLE TOWN CALLED TERNUSEN A VERY SMALL PORT BUT THERE WAS AND LONG JETTY SO WE COULD MORE ALONGSIDE THERE AND IN THE EVENINGS LATE AFTERNOON YOU GOT SHORE LEAVE UNTIL YOU WERE GOING OFF AGAIN NEXT MORNING AND I NEVER FORGOTTEN THE THINGS WE SAW WE WENT ASHORE THE GERMANS HAVE GOT OUT IN A HURRY AND THAT THEIR SIGNS WERE EVERYWHERE ON THAT HOTEL LOUNGE THAT WERE BEING AN OFFICER'S MISS AND THE SIGNS WERE STILL UP AND THEY BLEW SOME OF THE BRIDGES OVER THE CANALS AS THEY LEFT AND THE DUTCH FLOODED SOME OF THE DICE TO STOP THEIR HEAVY TRAFFIC GETTING AWAY AND I REMEMBER ONCE WE WENT ASHORE WE ALL CARRY THE NAVY RAINCOAT DRAPED OVER YOUR ARM FOLDED IN A CERTAIN WAY AND THE OBESE WATCH KNEW VERY WELL WE HAD THINGS IN THE POCKETS CIGARETTES PACKET OF BISCUITS A TILE GEM OR WHATEVER WHICH WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN OFF THE SHIP AND WE WERE GIVING IT TO THE DUTCH CIVILIANS CAUSE THEY WERE AS STARVED AS HELL AND LOOKED VERY ILL AND ON THIS OCCASION WE GOT ASHORE AND I SAW A VERY THIN AS LOOKING WOMAN COMING UP THE STREET PUSHING HER ABOUT A PRAM AND SHE GOT TWO LITTLE KIDS IN THERE ABOUT THREE OR A BIT LESS I SUPPOSE AND ONE BLANKET COVER THEM AND I DOFF MY HAD A GOOD DAY AND SHE GAVE ME A SMILE SHE COULDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH AND I COULDN'T SPEAK DUTCH BUT I TOOK OUT WHAT I HAD AND I PUT IT IN HER PRAM YOU SHOULD SEE THE LOOK ON HER FACE SHE MOST THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS COME TWICE AS WHAT THEY DIDN'T EAT THEY CAN ALWAYS TRADED FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO HAVE GONE BACK WITH MORE BUT IT WASN'T TO BE AFTER WE GOT RID OF MOST OF THE MINES OF THE DUTCH COAST WE HAD AN A WEEK'S LEAVE YOU WELL SO WE WON'T COMING BACK HERE FOR IT IT WOULD BE ON THE DUTCH COAST AND IN ANOTHER FELLOW WE GOT ON TO THE MAIN ROAD WHICH WAS THE BRUSSELS ROAD LEADING INTO A BELGIUM AND THUMB LIPS FROM ARMY LAYS WHICH ARE ALWAYS GOING UP AND DOWN AND WE GOT INTO ABOUT THREE THREE HOURS NOW A BIT LESS INTO BRUGES WHICH IS ONE THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SAID THAT I'VE SEEN GOT A TWO CATHEDRALS AND OPERA HOUSE AND THE TOWN HALL ROUND THE FOUR SIDES OF THE MAIN SQUARE AND A ONE OF THE HOTELS HAVE BEEN TAKEN OVER AS THE NAPPY FOR THE TROOPS BED BREAKFAST SO WE STAYED THERE AND WE ENJOYED OURSELVES THEN WHEN WE CAME BACK WE GOT OLDER BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AND WERE STILL LOOKING FOR MINES WHICH MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED DETECTION GOING UP AND DOWN BUT IT WASN'T A MUCH URGENCY ANY ANY MORE AND A I DID PUT IN APPLICATION TO SIT FOR LEADING STEWARD BUT BEFORE THAT COULD TAKE PLACE MY DISCHARGE PAPERS CAME THROUGH AND THAT WAS IN THE EARLY EARLY NINETEEN SIX FORTY NINETEEN FORTY SIX NINETY NINETY FORTY SIX YEARS AFTER THE WAR YEAR BUT UNLIKE THE ARMY OR THE AMPLE WE GOT PLENTY OF NOTICE WHEN IT WAS COMING I KNOW PEOPLE IN THE APPLES AND THEY WERE GIVEN THREE DAYS NOTICE THAT THEY WERE OUT BUT IN THE NAVY WE HAD TIME YOU TOLD YOU GOT TO BE DEMOBBED IN THREE MONTHS WHERE THEY GIVE YOU TIME TO START LOOKING ROUND FOR A CIVILIAN JOB OR SOMEWHERE TO LIVE IF YOU'RE MARRIED WITH KIDS SO I THINK WE HAD A BETTER DEAL CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS MINE SWEEPING JUST EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WERE DOING AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MINDS WELL LOOK LIKE A YARD FROM THE MAIN MAST STRETCHED OUT EITHER SIDE ABOUT FIFTY FEET AND FROM THESE ARE DEPENDING VERY SHARP CUTTING WIRES WITH WEIGHTS ON THE END AS YOU GO TO THE WATER THE IDEA IS TO YOUR CUTTING WIRES TO CATCH THE MORNING WISE FOR A MINE AND CUT IT THE MIND COMES TO THE SERVICE AND YOU DISPOSE OF IT HOW MANY MINDS WOULD YOU FIND ON AN AVERAGE DAY ON EVERY DAY AND POSSIBLY A DOZEN POSSIBLY ONLY TWO IT VARIED AND THE DISPOSAL WOULD BE A SHOT DEAL THAT'S WHAT I STARTED YES THEN THE GERMANS ADVENTURES HERE AND A COASTING MIND WHICH AN WASN'T MORE I WAS JUST DROPPED IN THE CHANNEL HOPEFULLY IN THE PATH OF ONCOMING SHIPS AND IT EMITTED A MAGNETIC FIELD FROM AND BATTERIES THAT WERE INSIDE AND EVERY SHIP AS IT GOES ALSO MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD AND WHEN THE TWO COLLIDE THE MIND GOES UP SO WE HAD TO HAVE WAS CALLED DEGALSING EQUIPMENT A SPECIAL COIL FITTED RIGHT ROUND THE SHIP AND A CURRENT IS PATH THROUGH THAT ANTI CLOCKWISE AND THAT NULLIFIES THE EFFECT OF THE ELECTRONIC FIELD AND YOU CAN GO OVER MINES AND YOU'D BE RIGHT DID YOU FIND THOSE NINE WE FOUND HIM YES SOMETIMES THE JOURNEYS GOT CRAFT AND THEY DROPPED SOME OF THESE MINES AT NIGHT FROM LOW FLYING PLANES AND WE GOT BACK I WASN'T THAT I WAS ON THE CUP OF DAYS LEAVE AND I WENT HOME TO MAIDSTONE BUT AND I WAS TOLD AS AS CORDEN CAME BACK FROM PATROL AND THE LAST AT THE SHIP IN SLID INTO ITS PLACE ON THE JETTY AND PROMPTLY BLEW UP THERE WAS A MINE UNDERNEATH BEING DROPPED BY A PLAIN AND THE SKIPPER OF THIS LAST BOAT AS HE WAS ONLY SIX FEET FROM THE JETTY AGONISED THE GAS THE EQUIPMENT SWITCHED OFF ASKED IN THERE WAS TWO SURVIVORS BUT WHO THEY WERE I DON'T KNOW BUT HOW WOULD YOU FIND I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD FIND A MIND THAT WAS FLOATING IN THE WATER YOU CUT IT AND IT FLOATS SO HOW DID YOU FIND THESE MAGNETIC MINDS WITH A ON THE BOTTOM OR THERE ON THE BOTTOM YES HOW WOULD YOU FIND THAT WERE WITH A LOT YOUR SOLAR DEVICE IT PICKS UP THE THE RADIATION FROM THE MIND AND YOU COULD SEE EXACTLY WHERE IT IS THE DROP A OF CHARGE ON IT YOU SET THE DEATH CHARGE FOR TWENTY FEET OR THIRTY WHATEVER IT IS AND JUST SOME POT THEM OVERS A SIDE ON THE WIRE GUN IN HOLLAND WHEN YOU GOT TO HOLLAND YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMORIES OF JUST THE DEVASTATION WHEN THE GERMANS GOT OUT NOW THEY TOOK EVERYONE WITH HIM ALIVE OR DEAD AND BLEW A COUPLE OF BRIDGES AND THEN RETREATED TOWARDS BELGIUM DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE WINNING THE WAR AT THAT STAGE YES THE GREAT DAY HAD COME THE INVASION HAD STARTED AND WE WERE PUSHING IN TEN FROM THE BEACHES WE HADN'T BEEN SHOT BACK OFF AGAIN AND THEY WERE STARTING TO TO TO BITE WHEN YOU WERE PULLED OUT OF THE DAY DID YOU WE WERE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WAS GOING ON IN DEDE AFTER THE BATTLESHIP TO THE RIDE YOU COME BACK TO BITE YOU KNOW WE WERE AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR THE BUT THE GUNS GOING ON THERE WHEN THE REMAINED BROADSIDE SIDE YES I THINK IT WAS A QUARTER TO SIX AND EIGHT MILES OF SHIPS ALL OPENED UP AT THE SAME TIME AND WE ALREADY GOT INFORMATION FROM THE UNDERGROUND OF RESISTANCE WORKERS WHERE THE GERMAN STRONG POINTS WERE ALL ALONG THE CLIFF TOPS HEAVY GUN IN PLACEMENTS BUNKERS FOR TROOPS AND SO ON AND THEY GOT CONTINUOUS PLASTERING AND THEY HADN'T QUITE FINISHED IT WAS A TO OUR BOMBARBAD AND ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WE STOPPED THE BOATS WERE GOING ASHORE WITH THE TROOPS DID YOU HEAR WE WERE ON THE MAN WAS BEHIND AND WE HEARD IT ALL RIGHT IT WAS SUCH A DEAFENING CRUCENDO OF NOISE THERE'S NOT NOTHING LIKE IT WOULDN'T EVEN HEAR IT NO YET WHAT DO YOU LIVE DAY OH THAT WAS AGAIN MARVELLOUS I WAS AWAITING DE MOB AND OF COURSE WE GOT RATHER MORE LEAVE ONE PIECE WAS DECLARED AND I'D GOT AND I THINK IT WAS A FOUR DAY PASS TO GO HOME TO MAIDSTONE AND IT CAME UP ON THE TRAINS TO VICTORIA AND THE PLACE WAS JUST ONE SEE THE MASS OF PEOPLE EVERY COLOUR EVERY UNIFORM MAYBE THING YOU WOULD THINK OF EVERYONE WAS SINGING DANCING LAUGHING AND WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS BECAUSE I LET THE HAIR DOWN AND IN FRONT OF BACK IN A PALACE YOU COULDN'T GOT A SHOE OWNING THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS STRETCHING BACK DOWN THE MALL WAITING FOR A KING AND QUEEN AND WINSTON TO COME ON THE BALCONY AND THE ROAR THAT WENT UP MUST HAVE GONE ON FOR ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES NON STOP AND REFLECT ON YOUR OLD NAVY SERVES NOW I AM I 'M GLAD I WENT MEANS I AND FOUND OTHERS DON'T HAVE TO READ ABOUT HISTORY WE WERE MAKING IT WE WERE PART OF THAT HISTORY AND I THINK IT SOME MEN TO BE PROUD OF ARE THERE ANY OTHER STORIES YOU WANT A YEAR I DON'T THINK ANY NOW AS I SAY MIND FEELING IS A VERY DULL OCCUPATION WITH OCCASIONAL SHORT PERIODS OF ACTIVITY BUT UNLIKE DESTROYERS OR BATTLESHIPS YOU YOU'RE NOT ENGAGED PERMANENT WAY WITH WITH THE OPPOSITE NUMBER WITH THERE ANY OCCASIONS WHERE YOU ENGAGED NO WE WERE NEVER ATTACKED BY PLAYS AS I SAID AND WE DIDN'T SEE THE GERMAN TROOPS THE ONLY CONTACT WE HAD WAS WHEN THEIR LONG RANGE GUNS ON THE FRENCH COAST TRIED TO GET US WHILE WE WERE MINE SWEEPING BUT THEY DIDN'T
