ERM MY NAME IS IREENE BELOMY I WRANG JUST ERM WHERE ERE YOU FROM I WAS FROM BRISTOL FROM THE FISHBONDS AREA ER WHERE I WAS BORN AND I WENT TO SCHOOL IN BRISTOL AND STARTED MY WORK AFTER SCHOOL IN BRISTOL HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN WAR BROKE OUT EM WELL I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN NINETEEN SO I WAS TWENTY WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE ARE YOU IN BRISTOL I KNEAW WHAT WHAT HAPPENE JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YOUR SCHOOLLING AN AND JUST LIFE IN BRISTAL SO I UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE YEAH ERM I ORIGINALLY WENT TO A SMALL PRIVATE SCHOOL ERM AND THEN WENT TO COLSTON FROM THERE AND ERM BRISTOL ITSELF I FOUND RATHER DULL YOU KNOW IT WAS ALL PUBS AND CHURCHES THAT'S HOW IT SEEMED TO ME YOU KNOW THERE WEREN'T THE FUN THINGS THAT THERE ARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY ERM SPENT MOST OF OUR TIME EITHER GOING TO THE OUR FREE TIME GOING TO THE CINEMA RM OR PLAYING SOME KIND OF GAMES YOU KNOW I BELONGED TO YOU KNOW VARIOUS HOCKEY TEAMS AND TENNIS CLUBS ERM AND ERM G DURING THE WAR ERM OF COURSE WE WORKED VERY LONG HOURS ERM AT YEIHT SO THAT YOU WEREN'T LOOKING FOR MUCH LEISURE FUN AND I MOVED BECAUSE OF THE BRISTOL BLITS DURING THAT TIME ERM I WAS PUT BY THE FIRM THEY DIDN'T WANT US IN THE DANGER OF CENTRALO BRISTOL AND SO ON AND SO THEY TOOK OVER A COTTAGE IN SHIPPS IN SOLDBURRY AND I LIVED IN SHIPS IN SOLDBURRY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS ERM AND THAT WAS QUITE GOOD FUN ACTUALLY THE SORT OF VILLAGE LIFE LOTS GOING ON BUT I'D ALWAYS HAD A END TO GO INTO THE NAVY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT MAINLY BECAUSE I HAD FRIENDS WHO HAD JOINED THE SERVICES ERM WAS IT WAS IT WRENS OVER ANY OTHER SERVICE YEAH I DIDN'T WANT TO JOIN DO YOU MEAN ER INA FOR AT SOR NO NO NO TH MY PARTICULAR FRIEND WENT INTO THE WAR AND SHE HAD A VERY INTERESTING TIME AS OUT IN WASHINGTON ER WORKING FOR THE NOT NABEL THE AIRFORCE THE WREN WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE YES YEH LIKE THE UNIFORM TO YEH JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YEHT AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE AND AN THE WORK AND STUFF ERM WELL ERM AS SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF DESIGNER IN THE BEGINNING EM IT WAS A QUESTION OF DOING ERM TYPING HE WOULD DICTATE HIS DESIGN ERM REPORTS BECAUSE IT ALL HAD TO GO UP TO THE AIR MINISTRY FOR APPROVAL ER BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR ERM AN ORDER FOR THESE PLANES OF COURSE AND IT WAS TYPING ALL THESE SHEETS OF DESCRIPTION OF THESE PLANES ERM AND THAT MEANT SAY HE WAS A VERY UNDISCIPLINED MAN IN HAT HE LEFT EVERYTHING TO THE LAST MINUTE SO ONE WAS WORKING QUITE LATE AT NIGHT VERY OFTEN TO GET IT DONE TO THE DEADLINE THAT THE MINISTRY HAD SET WHAT'S HIS NAME BASILL HENDERSON AND HE DESIGNED A SMALL PLANE CALLED THE ERM WHAT DOD THEY CALL IT ERM THE HENDY IT WAS A BREAKDOWN OF HIS NAME IT WAS BASILLHEN ERM IT'LL COME TO ME BUT IT WAS ERM ROUND ABOUT THE TIME THAT THERE WAS ERM ANOTHER CHAP DESIGNING THOSE SMALL PLANES ERM I CAN'T THINK OF HIS NAME NOW BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THAT WAR WAS COMING ERM NOT REALLY NO I MEAN TO SAY THE BOYS TAT WE USED TO MEET AND MIX WITH BUT WERE MOSTLY ERM AIR FORCE TYPES OR GEIN INTERESTED IN THE AIRFORCE AND WE KNEW THE IT WAS THE FIVE O ONE SQUADRON THE AT FILTHON ERM THAT MOST OF THEM FLEW WITH ERM AND WE KNEW AT TIMES THATFROM THEIR CONVERSATION THAT THINGS WERE GETTING VERY NEAR BUT ERM NOT REALLY NO NOT YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T PUTTING UP THE BARRICADES OR ANYTHING WHAT ABOUT THE OUTBREAK OF WAR DO YOU RMEMBER THAT I DO I N WE WERE ACTUALLY ON FILTON AIRADROME WEN THEN THAT SUNDAY WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED IT WATCHING THESE LADS IN THEIR PLANES TAKING OFF PURELY FOR EXERCISE SO I MEAN DID THINGS CHANGE IN BRISTOL WHEN WAR BROKE OUT WHAT WAS THE CHANGE DO YOU REMEMBER I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY BECAUSE MOST OF MY LIFE WAS SPENT BETWEEN FISH PONDS AND YT YOU KNOW I VERY RARELY WENT THE OTHER WAY TOWARDS TOWN AND DIDN'T REALLY GET ANY FEELING OF WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE ERM EVEN YOU KNOW I READ NOW ABOUT SOME OF THE GHASTLY THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBING YOU KNOW THE LOS OF LIFE ERM BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME DIRECTLY ERM MY PARENTS HAD A SHOP IN FISH BONS AND THEY STILL KEPT GOING YOU KNOW IN A QUIET SORT OF WAY DID YOU SEE THE BLITZ COUD YOU SEE WERE YOU IN WERE YOU IN YAHTE WHEN IT HA YES I WAS IN ER AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FIRM MOVED US TO LIVE IN YT SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BUSINESS OF TRAVELLING EM BUT WE DID HAVE A DAYLIGHT RAID IN YAHT AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC ERM THE WE THEY THEY SENT A SINGLE PLANE AND YOU SAE WE WERE ALL WORKING AWAY QUITE HAPPILY IN THE AIR RAY SIREN WENT AND ER I WAS BEING TAUGHT HOW TO PLAY BRIDGE BY THE FRIEND WHO WENT INTO THE AIR FORCE AND ERM WE DIDN'T TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE ARAY TIRIN BECAUSE WE NEVER HAD ANYTHING AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS THE MOST AUMIGHTY EXPLOSION AND THE WHOLE BUILDING SHOOK AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED A SINGLE PLANE HAD COME IN APPARENTLY IT CAME IN FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTHERN FRANCE AREA WHERE THE GERMANS HAD ERM AIRPORT AND HAD FLOWN UP THE BRISTOL CHANNEL TO SOMEWHERE NORTH OF GLOUCESTER PICKED UP THE RAILWAY LINE AND YEGHT RUNS ALONG THE RAILWAY LINE IF YOU KNOW THE BUILDING AND FLEW DOWN AND DROPPED THIS STRIP OF BOMBS ALONG THE FACTORY FORTUNATELY A COUPLE OF THEM DID GO OFF I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SEEING A DEAD BODY BECAUSE I KNEW MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FACTORY BECAUSE OF WHO I WAS WORKING FOR AND ONE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOUSE IN SHIPPING SOBERRY WAS A WOMAN CALLED SISTER HOBBS WHO BECAME QUITE WELL KNOWN FOR THE WORK SHE DID IN THAT BLITZ AND SHE JUST COUGHT HOLD OF ME AND SHE SAID COME ON WE'VE GOT TO GO UP TO THE BRICK FACTORY SHE SAID TO IDENTIFY THESE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN KILLED AND YOU KNOW I WAS TAKEN WHAT AS I IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE SORT IT TWENTY TWO AT TWENTY TWO TO SEE ALL THESE DISINTEGRATED BODIES AN I HADN'T SEEN A DEAD BODY BEFORE AND THAT WAS VERY TRAMATIC YEH WAS THAT DO YOU THINK A CATALIST FOR THINKING I WANT TO JOIN BECOME A WRENER NO I DON'T THINK SO NO NO THAT WAS QUIETLY SIMMERING AWAY AND I THINK THE CATALIST IN THE END WAS WHEN MY BOSS MOVED HE WENT TO A FIRM WHICH AGAIN YOU MAY KNOW OF BOOSY AND HAWKS THEY ERM HE WASN'T A MUSICIAN OR HE HADN'T MADE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE JOB THEY DID ORIGINALLY THEY WERE MAKING SPARE PARTS FOR SOME OF OUR GUN TURRETS AND THEY ERM FOUND THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD DESIGN WHAT THEY WANTED AND ERM THEY GOT HIM EM THEY HAD HUNTED HIM AND WHEN HE LEFT I WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH E PERSON WHO GOT THE JOB AND I THOUGHT I WANT TO MOVE BUT I HAD TO WORK QUITE HARD TO GET INTO THE WRENS BECAUSE OF COURSE I WAS IN A RESERVED OCCUPATION I WAS GOING TO ASK WAS ITI ASSUMED IT WAS A RESERVED OCCUPATION SO YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCEDURE TO GET OUT YES AND THEY WEREN'T THE WRENS WEREN'T OPEN FOR RECRUITMENTS ANYHOW AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE BEING ERM ER DRAWN I SUPPOSE ITS THE WORD FOR THE BIWAR ARTIST A MAN CALLED LEOPOLD FREEDMAN I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RUN TO EARTH SINCE I'VE TRIED BECAUSE HE DID A LIKE A MURAL OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THE FACTORY AND IT WENT TO THE ERM NATIONAL A WHAT'S THE ONE IN TRIFALGAR NI NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN TRIFALGAR SQUARE ERM AND ERM I WAS SITTING YOU KNOW WELL HE WAS DRAWING ME AND TALKING TO HIM AND I SAID I WANTED TO JOIN THE WRENS AND THE PROBLEM WAS THERE WERE NO VACANCIES AND I WAS IN A RESERVED ARCUPI SO HE GAVE ME THE NAME OF A WOMAN AGAIN I FORGOTTEN HER NAME BUT SHE WAS THE HEAD OF THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR IN LONDON SO I'D GO OFF TO LONDON TO SEE THIS WOMAN AND SHE TO SHE TOLD ME THE SORT OF INSIDE SECRET THAT I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN FAIRLY SOON BECAUSE THE WRENS WERE EXPANDING AND THEY EXPANDED VERY RAPIDLY AND I GOT IN VERY EASILY THEN BUT I HAD TO WAIT UNTILL THE DOORS OPEN CAUSE THE LORDS OF THE ADMIRALTY DIDN'T WANT WOMEN OUKNOW THEY RELUCTANTLY TOOK THEM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR BUT RYOU KNOW IT WAS A MAN'S SERVICE IT WASN'T FOR WOMEN BRILLIANT SO WHAT WAS THE PROCESS THEN FROM TRANSITIONING FROM BEING A SECRETARY IN YA TO BECOMING A WREN WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF IT YEAH I REMEMBER YOU KNOW HAVING MY PAPERS ON BEING SENT TO LEEDS BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY SUDDENLY EXPANDED E THEY HAD TO OPEN NEW TRAINING DEPOTS I WAS IN MY EARLY TWENTIES AND ERM I

YOU FELT WHEN YOU FOUND OUT YOU BEGAN FOLLOWING THE EXPEDITION OAT I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I FELT THAT MY II AM STILL THAT MY NAVAL LIFE WAS ANYTHING BUT NAVY YOU KNOW THOTWA CAUSE I HAD GREAT GREAT IDEAS OF BEING BOATS CREW AS I SAID NGOING TO SEA WITH A MAIL ERM SO I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE INLAND AS IT WERE ERM BUT ONCE I GOT USED TO IT ERM AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN ADVENTURE AS WELL IN GOING OVER DID YOU SAIL TO FRANCE WE WENT O YOU KNOW THERAS ERM BOTS THEY TOOK THE TROOPS OVER IN TEHE WE WENT OVE BECAUSE ACTUALLY ERM WHEN IT CAME TO IT THE WAR WAS THAT THE ARMY WAS ALMOST IN BERLIN BY THEN SO THEY FELT IT WAS SAFE TO PUT THE GIRLS OVER ERM AND WE WENT ACROSS TO A LITTLE TOWN IN NORMANDY CALLED GRONVIL ON THE RMWER DUCKS WE CALLED THEM YOU KNOW D U K

FACT THAT IWASL ERM I SUPPOSE I THINK THEY WERE PROBABLY NEARLY BETWEEN FIFTY AND HUNDRED OF US GOING NOT ONLY WRENS BUT OTE ERM TRYIG TO THINK WE WENT FROM ERM ONEONE OF THE EM LITTLE PORTS THEY WEREN'T REALLY PORTS THAT WERE AROUND THE BULEY RIVER THAT THAT WAY ERM WE WERE EXCITED WE DIDN'T YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAD ALL SORTS OF IMAGINATIONS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN CROSSING THE CHANNEL T MIGHT SINK YOU KNOW YOUD BE ABLE TO SWIM FAR ENOUGH AND ER EM E YOU KNOW THEY WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WATER WHEN WE GOT THE OTHER SIDE LIKE YOU SEE THE MEN YOU KNOW TRAILING OUT WITH ALL THEIR STUFF THROUGH WATER THEY MANAGED TO BEACH US SO WE WERE QUITE DRY WHEN WE GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU KNOW THE FRENCH ACTUALLY IN NORMANDY WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING THEY WERE VERY PLEASED TO SEE US THEY WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN MY VIEW TO THE ONES WE MET IN PARIS WHAT WAS IT OBVIOUSLY WATORN OH YES YEAH YOU KNOW THE ERM COS IT WOULD BE AFTER D DAY OF COURSE WE WEREN'T ACROSS SO THINGS WERE STILL PRETTY ERMBROKEN YOU KNOW ALL THE EM ERSORT OF FRONT LINE HOUSES AND THINGS WERE ALL BASHED ABOUT COUS THEY'D BEEN BOMBARDED OF COURSE FROM THE SEA AN AND AND GRANTVILLE WHAT WAS THE SET UP THERE AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE STILL IN A WARWAR ZONE BASICALLY AREN'T YOU YEAHIT WAS A WAR ZONE ER WELL IT IT WAS JUST A SORT OF GETTING OFF POINT FOR MOVING PEOPLE ON BEHIND THE ARMY I THINK IT WAS FELT TO BE A REASONABLE PLACE TO START MOVING CAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF EQUIPMENT AS WELL WE DIDN'T BUT THE ARMY AND THE AIR FORCE AND THE NAVY FOR THAT MATTER ALL HAD EQUIPMENT TO MOVE UP WITH US ERM AND I THINK RVIL PROBABLY A AT A LITTLE TOWN WAS CONSIDERED YOU KNOW THEY HAD ERM GOOD ROAD NOT GOOD BUT THE TRANSPORT SITUATION MOVING STUFF WAS REASONABLE BUT VERY BASIC LIVING CONDITIONS YOU KNOW WE HAD NO WA RUNNING WATER OR ERM ER WE HAD SORT OF THINGS LIKE YOUR TRYPOD WITH CANVAS BAGS IN THEM WHICH WE USED THIS WASHING ERM MACHINE ER WELL ERM FOR WASHING WHAT AWAS THERE ERM IT WAS LIKE THE CABIG REALLY FROM TE LIVING POINT OF VIEW AND VERY LITTLE WORK WE HAD AT THAT TIME AND WHAT WERE YOU JUST WRITING OR DID YOU HAVE TELEPRINTERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WAS THERE ANY TECHNOLOGY OH YES THERE WAS A LOT OF BUT NOT IN THE GROUP I WAS WITH DI YOU KNOW TH ACTUALLY THE FIRT PEOPLE TO GO OVER WITH THE COMMUNICATORS ERM THE TELEPHONE OPERATORS AND SO ON AND OF COURSE THEY WERE STILL THE ENGINEERS WERE STILL FITTING UP FIELD ERM EQUIPMENT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND THERE WERE A LOT OF ERWRENS IN THAT GROUP TREMENDOUS LUMBER AND ERM FROM GRANVIELD ERM YOU KNOW THEY FOUND THAT THE WORK THEY WANTED ME TO DO WAS MORE CENTRED BACK IN LONDON SO I WAS SHIPPED BACK TO T LONDON ER TO WAIT UNTIL THEY'D ER PREPARED WHAT WE NEEDED ERM OR I HAD TO HELP DO THAT RM AND WE WENT THEN ER TO PARIS ER BUT I WENT FROM LONDON FROM ENGLANDS LANE

BEEN DONE AN LIFE BECAME RATHER SORT OF E THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY POINTS IN WHAT WE WERE DOING WED DONE IT ALL YOU KNOW SO IT WAS A BIT OF A PLAYGROUND WAS THIS AT THE END OFIS THIS AFTER THE WAR YEAH A ME SAY THE THE ERM TROOPS THAT HAD ENTERED BERLIN ERM AND WE WERE BACK IN PARIS SO IT WAS SORT OF JUST AS THE WAR WAS ENDING E THE FIRST TA YES IT HAD ENDED BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
