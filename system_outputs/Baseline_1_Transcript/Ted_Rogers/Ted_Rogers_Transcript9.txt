i mean how long were you in the navy and the merchant navy after that after the war now i stayed on the merchant navy till i left the merchant navy i couldn't leave i couldn't leave i had to get demoemobilized you couldn't leave immediately after the end of the war we had to wait another year then you had to be demobilized by the government minister transport i got my demobilization tificate there and and then i'd decided already i must train for the priesthood you see so then i went into a cemetery am when when did you have a moment did that you want it to join the priesthood well there were several moments if you like one was a moment just after being torpid and i was in the sea and i thought you know what can i do for my life and then others were in the tropics you see when you're an especially when you're an officer of the watch for hours at night in the tropics near the ships steaming along a beautiful stars and so on and you're looking out you can't see anything there upon but from the wondrous stars you know it's conducive to praying you know the glory of the lord in the stars and we had to do a bit of navigation so we knew a bit about stars and things like that you know and then that was a sort of other area that you know had a big impact on me and then i had a girlfriend a in the anteroom and then a when i was sort of moles my last year at sea i had to make up my mind whether i sort of cold here on what happened you know and eventually i decided that i wanted to become a priest sir i wrote and told her my decision you know am so that was another rather dramatic moment if you like
