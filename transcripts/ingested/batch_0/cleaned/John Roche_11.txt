how long were you in trincomalee i was there for about twelve months were you there for v day then no i was back here we arrived there around christmas nineteen forty three and i left there in christmas nineteen forty four and i came here then before i knew it i was shipped back out to sydney which ship i went on the cruiser devonshire the devonshire steamed out and we took over the ships company and then another crowd took over and steamed her back it was like a troop ship really when i got to sydney i stayed out there for two and a half years then around to the far east by that time it was the end of the war i went out there in august september just after v day all the boys who had been retained in the navy at the end of the war some of them should have gone to pension from nineteen thrity nine nineteen forty they all had group numbers and we demobbed so we kept getting shipped around onto various ships ships were coming home with the boys ready for discharge so us regulars had to stay and go from one ship to another ships were coming home and you went on another and stayed there i was away for about two and a half years and ended up on seventeen ships what was your favorite port of call sydney was pretty good i mean during the war except from going to rothside and going down to edinburgh there weren't a lot of other places we went to we had to run ashore in quebec you couldn't get a drink when you were out there you had to go to a licensed place to get a ticket in order to get a drink we ran ashore in alexander but by large we didn't get a good lot of runs ashore where the fleet anchorages were they were miles away from anywhere you know up in iceland scapa flow or loch ewe or greenock wasn't bad i suppose we had a couple of runs into there you could go up to glasgow we only came into devonport once all during the war was there a time where you were ever terrified no i would say there was never a time where i was scared because you always had such good people around you we were all young around twenty years of age you weren't afraid of anything in those days your mates made a joke out of most things it was a case of what will be would be i suppose i don't remember being scared at all really tell me about these kittens most ships had a cat on board or a mascot we had a lot of rats on board renown and there was a chap called marlow who was an abled seaman and he was a country boy he told the commander that he would catch the rats so he was appointed the rat catcher so he used to go around and put fuse wire snares all around the cable runs and he reported to the commander every morning to say how many rats he caught he'd get six pence for every rat he caught and then one morning he'd found baby rats and the commander said to him i'm not paying you for those they haven't got any hair on he took them away and kept them in the box for a week until they grew hair and he bought them back again you could be walking along the ship at night there wasn't any light anywhere and all of a sudden a rat would hit you in the face because they would be hanging off of his snares the cats didn't catch too many i think he caught most of them the cat was just a ships pet they probably went ashore one time the cat went off and come back and then had kittens but most ships i was on had a cat a dog a parrot or a monkey most ships i knew had a mascot the planes that were on board tell me a bit about what they were were they catapults yes the planes we had the walrus c planes and we launched them by catapult and then the plane could fly around for as long as it could before it ran out of fuel and they would land along side and then you would get a crane and hoist back on board with all the aircraft carriers carrying most of the planes those planes sort of became redundant half way through the war our planes were taking up quite a lot of space on board there were two hangers one became a mess deck and the catapult deck could be made into the boat deck i think it was nineteen forty two when the planes became redundant to our needs and they were taken off what was it like watching them go oh it was pretty good you know we used to hear a bang and the next thing they'd be gone they were all walrus c planes they struggled away to gain a bit of height pretty brave boys flew them you could get a petty officer that was a pilot and they weren't all officers in the fleet it was pretty dicey to land those in rough weather conditions trying to get the crane to hoist these planes back on board was a pretty dicey job it wasn't very easy they were a bit cumbersome but i guess they served a purpose would it have been much fun using them in the arctic no we didn't use them up there but by in large there were aircraft carriers up there they wouldn't have been much use the weather would have been so rough you wouldn't have been able to recover them how do you reflect on your time in the navy now i enjoyed i enjoyed all the friends i met you meet some good guys and i put up with a lot of things it didn't do me much harm in the long run i'm over ninety now and i'm still going along i'm able to drink my rum still so there we are
