This file implements methods for calculating a number of similarity error
measures between a ground-truth sentence and a hypothesis sentence, which are
commonly used to measure the performance for an automatic speech recognition
(ASR) system.

The following measures are implemented:

- Word Error Rate (WER), which is where this library got its name from. This
  has has long been (and arguably still is) the de facto standard for computing
  ASR performance.
- Match Error Rate (MER)
- Word Information Lost (WIL)
- Word Information Preserved (WIP)

    Calculate error measures between a set of ground-truth sentences and a set of

    The set of sentences can be given as a string or a list of strings. A string
    input is assumed to be a single sentence. A list of strings is assumed to be
    multiple sentences. Each word in a sentence is separated by one or more spaces.
    A sentence is not expected to end with a specific token (such as a `.`). If
    the ASR does delimit sentences it is expected that these tokens are filtered out.
    
    Optional `weights` argument should be a dictionary of words and their corresponding
    (integer or float) weights. A word with weight x is treated as if it (and the 
    corresponding word in the aligned hypothesis string) were repeated x times in 
    the calculation of hits, substitutions and deletions. 
    Insertions always carry weight `insertion_weight` (by default this is equal to `default_weight`).
  
    Note that the weights are assigned AFTER preprocessing (see below).
    
    Words not present in the `weights` dictionary are given weight `default_weight`.
    This is set to 1 by default, but using a value of 0 would enable calculation
    of metrics like (W)KER which focus exclusively on specified keywords.

    The optional `transforms` arguments can be used to apply pre-processing to
    respectively the ground truth and hypotheses input. Note that the transform
    should ALWAYS include `SentencesToListOfWords`, as that is the expected input.
