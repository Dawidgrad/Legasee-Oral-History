what were you at this well the war finished and we came down lock stock and battle from hatton to haylesworth cause they closed hats on them and halesworth had been an arif station so we had to mess with the men i don't mean i mean mess with the men you know have your meals of things with the men and the rents were very lucky really because we always had teapots big teapots the old enamel ones but always in a teapot whereas when we got down there i suppose they'd left a lot of the stuff there and they had arms so you never know whether you're having tea coffee or co cut or tasted the same instead of keeping one for tea only and one for coffee only and so for oh no i didn't like that at all you never be a yes i do i do indeed but there wasn't that much i think london was probably the place to be and v day really because we still would be on duty was being in communications i bore the cross flags on my sleeve rather than the or whatever and i think come you are always on duty to consider and watch keeping if you have mornings or you have afternoons you have evening shifts and night shifts and i preferred that notary than a nine to five job senate return of the convoys lines of oh well now i was on loan to lines for three weeks somebody had been off two weeks or three weeks i can't remember but am somebody was off six so i had to go to lines to cover and during that time the nabob came in right and i could see there the switch hops and things were underground a bit if not on the top slightly underground and i remember my tea break i went up to ground level and you could i watched these sold sailors come off the ship and they were all looking about sixteen to eighteen very young looking you know and as drunk as lords really they were but you can't blame them can you cause they they were they could have been the bottom of the ocean by then you know and especially deciding to limp back to the lines you know well the funny thing is that years after when i am married alfred it wasn't till two years or so after i married him and i was talking about we're talking about the renter or the owners or something and i said something about the nabob and he said what did you say the neighbor deer and his brother in law was on that ship tom must have seen him come off that day and all these years later has to be sixty years later or so we find this out isn't it a small world don't you reflect on the war now that that the war itself and your work in the war a well i'm glad i joined up i must admit i think come i had a better time in the services than i would have had if i had just been working in whatever am and war time well i i think am my first not wouldn't be my first year my second job after i was demobbed about its stance kitchen equipment in victoria street and there was a woman there she was older than i was and she had a son peter who was in i think he was the army and he was in germany she never had a good word to say for instance about germans ever you know well would you believe peter was stationed there for a while and he only married a german girl so she had to eat a word die but am i've made good friends i have no crams about there's good and bad in everybody you know in an every written a race and nation so but i can what i can't understand nowadays is this conflict going on em in cure for instance how can people kill their own i just don't understand it well i i can see the point because as i say i'm in when we were in diplomatic service for instance one of our first postings was to our lagos in nigeria well again there are loads of tribes there provided me a little bit of the scottish clans frankly you know and then of course they we had left just before the e bows and the robots were there you know the east and the west because of the oil again am well a tribe's okay but i can't see this in syria i really can't and i can't see why scotland wants to separate either alex simon wants his head sorted and what about being a re how you feel about that red being a ran proud of it proud of it very proud of it now i when i was at the globe in laurel i bought another hat when i was transferred back to the fleet air arm of course i had to wear the m s so i kept my marine hunt and every time i went on leave i would swap it over because nobody knew what i was then you see i was so proud of my marine and go well because i was attached to marine the home base leg or office in ilfracombe it's really i suppose the pay office and that sort of thing that's why everything had to go through there when people were injured and died and so forth am yes so i do know i used to notice people looking at me you see the wondering what i was and i like that
