okay kevin first of all i say we can you just introduce yourself the same name at your rating and age please i'm kevin martin fenton i'm fifty six and i was in the royal a medical care in her army em as a corporal okay kevin well just tell me where where are you from and and why did you find yourself going for the services i come from middlesbor originally up the north east of england i always wanted to join the forces but it was the royal navy made me brothers in the sea cadets and we had an uncle who was in the navy who i met in the falklands and he did twenty six years and we always used to come down to portsmouth to go on to ships so we're all navy mad but unfortunately i couldn't get in case i got a bad right eye i also tried to for the merchant navy as well so i was a bit stuck with jobs anyway i went to see my a sort of a employable employment officer and he said oh cavenuw could art said war bacon as a printer i never thought of it before so i became an apprentice printer in a small firm and i ain't have gone on block release to erm to in our college tsi college of art in middlesborough and where my grandparents lived or stayed there cause we lived in bellingham and what happened was i used to as pass the army and a f careers office on me push bike going to the college saw one dear i just went in cause i joined the territorial army beforehand when i when i reached eighteen and it went from there so so i spent quite some time in the army then and how did you find that transition from being a sort of a prince or apprentice to an army boy it wasn't too bad because i had done a lot of discipline when i was in the sea cadets and in some boy organizations beforehand like the cubs and scouts he saw erm i wouldn't say it was easy though i mean obvisly were fitness and whatever it was quite tough really where was it nineteen seventy seven i did me a training and not so was a lot of running a lot of a classroom work and whatever this was before doing because as a medic so we did eleven weeks basic training with drill and everything else weapon weapon training and then we did a passing out parade and after passing out parade we came back to do our tree training depending what people were doing in the medical care itself i went as a combat medical technician or was a med it was a medical assistant when i first joined and now it's known as a combat medical technician others were laboratory technicians and nurses et cetera et cetera so why did you do why did you think i'd like to get into the many side em well i'd i'd always i was always into helping people i wanted to help people in whatever and i'd done some first did when i was in the sea cadets and i i wanted to join the medics in the navy originally but one of my aunties said oh you don't want to join them because the sun so sort of thing and that put me off in the first place so i was going to go in as a sheff which which which was my second choice because sir i did a lot of katrin when i was at school and that in the last two years so i i loved to do cooking and out so and what were you doing then what would just talk a bit about some of the early training you did as a medic well em we did tom we we did the same as infantry in my recruits or in and i mean we did a lot of bersley were being attacked and whatever and we had to the sort of do we bersley a sort of rapid sort of reaction to to these attacks and bercy get down into some cover and whatever he had to learn all about working out in the field and whatever now we did a lot of field craft am digging trenches living in them a living in a bivouac camouflage concealment all sorts all what the a a normal soldier does because as they say you're a soldier first and the trade second and that so so bessy you were infantry but you re medico as well so could you could survive out in the field like any soldier really am so did all that then we did a when when i went to be first unit which was germany you do in a lot of exercise there with vehicles armored vehicles cause we had arm armored personal carriers am we were am doing guard duties at times and we ever on the camp in the camp when when we were not not not on exercise am i did some skiing with the military from the sky course in bavaria am and then i was then i did me me from class three medic i was added class two medic while i was in germany so you do in exams and not which upgrade you to another band and for paper as well i mean increased your peer by passing your class to medic and am now now two were light air sort of primer stoves and hitch p p lamps high pressure pump lamps a hurricane lamps we also had to me out a bic lighter bears a number one burner which were on these petrel ones which had to pump to the right pressure which usually the cooks used but i mean because i was in a section you were self contend you didn't have you didn't have any any shifts or cooks with you so you were self contained in your area and the the sergeant use usually was classed as the doctor because sometimes you won't guarantee of a doctor so we had to know the signs and symptoms of things and busy deal with them and treat them give tablets if need be as well penicillin intravenous infusions and that and then and then on you then you went after it used to go every year whatever used to do train and even em for you medicine but used to have refreshes and stuff like that as well am i had to come back to england who were just outside all the shots on our depot to do me class one course and that was more responsibility and more over then and that and then he then there was office chance of promotion then and things like at as well where are we in times of what year is this and in up to lean to level one i was taught about the must be in the end of seventy nine i did me class one so that was probably about two and half years after i did my class three and did you did you get lied yeah did lit added ireland on two to the first time i i was in germany at the time as a class to medic and one of one of my mates here had cooked just come up from norman island and it was a volunteer post really for a four month too but he was working in the operating theatres in musgrave park hospital so he said others the vitter of ex he gone from here so i knew about it before anyone else so i applied for it not telling my parents of course i told them i was going to alan but i didn't say i'd volunteered but i was i volunteered busy for the experience cause i would have learnt a lot which i did do when i worked in the operating theatre with the normal operations and then with the bomb blasts and gunshot wounds they know that stuff like that so i did learn quite a bit it must have been fascinit was cuse it might sound a bit morbid but i vastly er it made me hungry if we used to work over over the dinner time period the chefs used to leave a lord of sandwiches in our restroom so once it all finished i stood there i use to percy wolf these sandwiches down and a that it just is just as fussing to me and a
