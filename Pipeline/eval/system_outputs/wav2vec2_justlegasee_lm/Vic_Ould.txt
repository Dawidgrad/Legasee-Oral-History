BORN IN LONDON A CITY ROAD HOSPITAL NINETEEN TWENTY SIX MY MOTHER TOLD ME THE SNOW WAS UP TO THE WINDOW SILL I HOPED SHE MEANT THAT THIS WAS ON THE GROUND FLOOR WITHIN A FEW DAYS I WAS A POOR BABY I WENT DOWN WITH DOUBLE NUMONIA WHICH IS ONE OF THE CHILD KILLERS OF THOSE YEARS AND THEREFORE WAS ON OPEN ORDER MEANT THAT EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY CHECKED YOU JUST TO SEE IF YOU WERE STILL ALIVE AND ANY OF YOUR RELATIONS COULD COME IN AT ANY TIME TO MYSELF AND MY MOTHER OF COURSE IN THE BED BY THE SIDE OF ME WAS STILL GOING ALRIGHT I WAS BAPTIZED IN THE HOSPITAL CHAPEL AND FORTUNATELY I MANAGED TO OVERCOME THAT PROBLEM WHY DID YOU WANT TO JOIN THE NAVY AND WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND THAT I THINK REALLY IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FOR PEOPLE TO ENVISAGES NOW THE WAR WAS WITH PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF YOU WANTED TO FIGHT BACK IS LIKE A BURGLAR TRYING TO BREAK INTO YOUR DOOR NORMALLY YOU'LL TRY AND STOP HIM I WAS DOING A CERTAIN AMOUNT WITH THE P I REALLY WANTED TO GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER SO I THOUGHT ABOUT IT I THOUGHT WELL I'LL TRY AND GET MORE INVOLVED SO I WENT TO THE LOCAL DRILL HALL WHERE HE USUALLY TAKE VOLUNTEERS FOR ANY OF THE THREE SERVICES THIS WAS THE ONE IN EDGWARE DEENSBROOK ROAD AND VOLUNTEERED FOR THE NAVY CAME ALONG TO PASS ALL THE TESTS THERE A LITTLE A FEW WEEKS LATER AND THEY ACCEPTED ME AND SAID A LETTER WOULD FOLLOW BUT THEY COULDN'T TAKE ME AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WAS ONLY SEVENTEEN THEY SAID THEY TAKE ME AT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF PROVIDING THE JOB I WAS GOING TO DO IN THE NAVY TOOK ABOUT SIX MONTHS SO I'D BE EIGHTEEN AT THE TIME WHEN I COULD GO ON BOARD A SHIP SO WHEN I HAD STARTED WORK ON THE MONDAY AFTER THAT I SAID TO THE FORMAN WELL I'VE JOINED THE NAVY I'M GOING OH NO NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT WE WANT YOU HERE WE'RE DOING MORE WORK HERE WE CAN STOP YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO JOIN THE NAVY IT'S I'VE MADE UP MY MIND I JOIN THE NAVY FORGET IT AND IT'S ANOTHER BIT OF LUCK BECAUSE THAT FIRM WAS WORKING A HUNDRED PERCENT WITH ASBESTOS AND AT THE TIME WAS NO PROBLEM FIND OUT LATER ON NEARLY EVERYBODY IN THAT FIRM THAT I KNEW DIED OF ASBESTOSIS SO THERE MUST HAVE BEEN ANOTHER ONE OF MY LUCKY LUCKY TIMES SO ANYWAY FROM THERE ON MY AGE OF SEVENTEEN AND A HALF A LETTER ARRIVED REPORT TO THE DRILL HALL WHERE YOU JOINED AND YOU'LL BE TAKEN ON FROM THERE TO HMS ROLE ARTHUR S JULY I TURNED UP THERE WERE A LITTLE CROWD OF US GOT IN A TRUCK I THINK IT WAS TO THE LONDON STATION AND LONDON STATION A GROUP OF US WENT UP TO SKEGNESS AND THERE WE ARE HIS ROYAL ARTHUR THERE WE DID JOINING ROUTINE GET A UNIFORM AND BE TOLD LOTS OF THINGS ABOUT THE NAVY LOTS OF HORROR STORIES I'M AFRAID ESPECIALLY WITH WHAT IS KNOWN NOWADAYS AS WELL I THINK IT'S VENEREAL DISEASE IN THAT DAY WHICH IT WAS RIFE I WENT ON FROM THERE AFTER I PASSED ALL MY USUAL TESTS UP TO SCOTIA WHERE I WENT THROUGH THE EXAM FOR A TELEGRAPHIST IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR I WENT DOWN FROM THERE TO RELATE AGAIN AND AT THAT TIME D DAY WAS COMING UP AND THEY'D HAD QUITE ENOUGH TELEGRAPHIST WHAT THEY WANTED THEY SAID WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHANGE OVER TO SOMETHING ELSE I SAID WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED SOMETHING ELSE AND IT'S A YES WELL YOU CAN BECOME AN ABLE SEAMAN AND FROM THERE THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS YOU'RE GOING FOR SO I THOUGHT I LIKED THE SOUND OF THAT ALTHOUGH I WAS A TELEGRAPHIC PART EXAMS WENT DOWN FROM THERE TO MS GANGES GANGES WAS TOUGH YOU CAN'T SAY THAT HARD ENOUGH IT WAS TOUGH AFTER BEING IN SOMEWHERE LIKE MISCOTIA WHICH IS QUITE EASY YOU LOVED IT WELL BECAUSE YOU HAD TO BE A NAVAL SEAMAN AND A NAVAL SEAMAN AS IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A TOUGH JOB FOR ONE THING BECAUSE D DAY WAS COMING UP YOU DID TRAINING TO FIGHT ON THE LAND AS WELL AS FIGHT ON THE SEA SO WE WERE GOING IN FOR BEING IT PRACTICE THROWN HAND GRENADES AMONGST THE ORDINARY SEAMAN SHIP JOBS AND D DAY HAPPENED WHILE I WAS STILL THERE AND WE COULD HEAR THE FIGHTING GOING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HARRY FROM FROM THE LANDING AND WE WERE GIVING BLOOD WE CAN FOR THE INJURED AND WE WERE TOLD SEVERAL TIMES THAT IF THE FIGHTING GETS ANY WORSE AND IT'S HORRIFIC NOW YOU WILL BE OVER THERE JOINING THEM WHETHER YOU'RE FULLY TRAINED OR NOT SO FORTUNATELY THE FIGHTING ALTHOUGH IT INJURIES TOUGHER THAN THEY WERE PASSED OUT AS A ORDINARY SEAMAN AND THEN AFTER THAT WAS ASKED IF I WANTED TO DO WHAT WAS CALLED A SUB RATE TO SURE YOU COULD BE AN ATTIC OPERATOR A GUNNER YOU COULD BE A TORPEDO MAN WELL AS I WAS ALREADY CARRIED OUT TRAINING AS A TELEGRAPHIT BEING A RADIO OPERATOR SEEMED ABOUT THE NEXT STEP THAT WAS ANOTHER SHORT COURSE OVER THE ISLE OF MAN IT WAS ALL STONE FRIGATES THAT YOU'VE BEEN THERE WERE ALL STONE FRIGATES ALL THE LAND BASED STONE FRIGATES SO FAR I'D NEVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP ONLY A LITTLE WHALERS AND THIS TYPE OF THING WHERE WE DID SAILING LEARNT TO SAIL LEARN TO DO ALL THE KNOTS AND EVERYTHING IN THE GANGES ANYWAY BETWEEN THAT WHEN I HAD FINISHED MY TELEGRAPHIC COURSE AND TO ME WELL WE'RE NOT SURE WHETHER WE WANT ENOUGH TELEGRAPHIERE 'S LOTS OF OPTIONS SO I SAID WELL CAN I HAVE THE OPTIONS HE SAID WELL ONE NICE JOB THAT'S COMING UP NOWADAYS IS A SIGNALMAN ON LANDING CRAFT AND I SAID THEY SAID WELL YOU'VE DONE ALL THE TRAINING YOU ONLY HAVE TO LEARN TO BE A SIGNALMAN THE FLAGS AND SO FORTH BUT I CAME INTO MY HEAD WITH A VISION OF LANDING CRAFT AND ME STANDING UP AT THE FRONT THERE FLAG WAVING AND THE GERMANS SHOOTING AT THE LAND WAVE I SAID NO I'M NO HERO I COME HERE TO DO A JOB HERE OR ANYWAY SO I FINISHED UP AS A RADAR OPERATOR THERE WAS TWO TYPES OF RADAR OPERATORS THERE WAS A RADAR PLOT AND THERE WAS RADAR GUNNERY CONTROL WELL AS I CARRIED OUT GUNNERY IN GANGES ON BIG GUNS THEY HAD SIX INCH HEAVY GUNS THERE THAT YOU TRAINED ON I OPTED FOR THE RADAR CONTROL GUNNERY I DID THAT COURSE AND FROM THERE I WENT DOWN TO CHATHAM WHICH WASN'T MY BASE ANYWAY I WAS A CHATHAM RATING AND WAITED THERE FOR A SHIP WHAT YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE SHIP ALL YOU DO IS WALK ABOUT THE BARRACKS HAVE JOBS LIKE PAINTING COAL WHITE OR SWEEPING UP ALL DIFFERENT PLACES AND YOU GO DOWN EVERY EVENING IN YOUR OWN TIME TO WHAT I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED THE OLD BIG BARN AND HAVE LISTS OF PEOPLE TO GO ON DRAFT FOR A SHIP THE FIRST ONE I CAME ACROSS GOING DOWN THERE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS I HAD MY NAME ON THERE WAS QUITE A LOT IN THIS DRAFT SO WE HAD TO GO FOR SOME REASON TO HAVE A MEDICAL EVERYBODY HAD TO PASS THROUGH MEDICAL THAT WAS ON THAT DRAFT WHERE IT WAS WHAT IT WAS FOR THEY NEVER TELL YOU THEY NEVER TELL YOU IN THE NAVY IT'S KNOWN AS THE SILENT SERVICE THEY NEVER TOLD ME ANYTHING SO ANYWAY I WENT THROUGH THIS MEDICAL EXAMINATION AS IT CAME TO MY TURN TO SEE THE MEDICAL OFFICER HE SAID OUT OUT I STAND OUT ON ONE SIDE AND WAIT FOR SOME TIME CROSS AND I SAID WHAT'S WRONG HE SAID YOU'VE GOT GERMAN MEASLES WELL MY GOODNESS GERMAN MEASLES AND YOU'RE FIGHTING THE GERMANS I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE NEAR GERMANY HE SAID DON'T BE FUNNY I SPENT A FEW WEEKS IN SIG BAY I'VE GOT NO MEMORY AT ALL OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE I DON'T THINK ANYTHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF YOU'RE GOING ON THE DRAFT AND GOING ON THE SHIP OBVIOUSLY TWO HUNDRED MEN UPWARDS ON THE SHIP COULD PASS IT ON A FEW WEEKS TIME MY NAME WAS ANOTHER DRAFT AND THIS WAS FOR MS KARAN WE WERE NOT TOLD WE JUST WE'RE GOING ON A DRAFT AND YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF DRAFT SO WHEN THE TIME CAME THERE WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED OF US FROM CHATHAM WE WERE PUT ON NAVY TRUCKS OPEN BACK WELL OVER OPEN BACK AND IT COVERED TRUCK TAKEN DOWN TO THE LONDON ON I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IT WAS NOW BUT ALL OF US ON ONE TRAIN I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY OTHER ANY OTHER PEOPLE ON THAT TRAIN IF WE RUN UNDER THE DOOR LOCKED WE WERE LOCKED IN A YOUNG LADS BY THE SIDE OF ME SAID NO THAT'S FOR I SAID YEAH STOP US GETTING OUT NAVISTOP THE GIRLS GETTING TO US WHEN YOU GET TO A STATION THAT STARTED THE CHAT WE GOT FRIENDLY NONE OF US EVER KNEW EACH OTHER COME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE ANYWAY THAT WAS A LONG TRIP UP TO GLASGOW GLASGOW QUITE A FEW TIMES I THINK FOR AIR RAIDS FOR NO REASON I BELIEVE WE STOPPED AT CARLYLE AND THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED THE CARRIAGES LOVELY CUPS OF TEA AND SANDWICHES PASSED ACROSS FROM THE S OR WHOEVER NOW ANYWAY AFTER A LITTLE REST STARTED TO TRAIN AGAIN AS WE DREW OUT OF THE STATION I REMEMBER THERE WAS FACTORY BY THE SIDE OF THE STATION RIGHT ON THE TRACK AN OLD MILL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND OUT OF THE WINDOWS THERE WAS BALLOONS AND GIRLS WAVING THE BALLOONS WERE NOT SOME OF THE BALLOONS I CAN REMEMBER THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OF ANOTHER TYPE WHICH I WON'T MENTION BUT ANYWAY THAT WAS NICE WE LOVED THAT THE FACT OF BEING CHEERED ON OUR WAY WE EVENTUALLY ARRIVED IN GLASGOW AND THE TRAIN CHANGED STRAIGHT AWAY OVER TO BEEN A LOCAL TRAIN THAT TRAIN TOOK US TO GREENOCK GREAT WAS OUR DESTINATION AND WE WERE THEN PUT INTO IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE C A BIG BUILDING AND WE WERE THEN TOLD THAT WE WERE DUE TO A SHIP'S COMPANY OF A BRAND NEW SHIP BUILT IN THE SHIPYARD WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO HIM IS FAVORITE WAS REALLY NOW IT WASN'T READY WE COULD GO AND LOOK OVER THE SHIP ANY TIME WE LIKED AND MASS OF WIRES AND PEOPLE WELLED IN AND I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT WE DID WE MUST HAVE WALKED ABOUT GREENOCK ANYWAY IN A FEW WEEKS THE SHIP WAS READY ALL THE OLD WIRES AND BITS AND PIECES HAD BEEN REMOVED AND WE WERE PLACES I WAS ON THE FOREHEAD MESS DECK WE WERE POINTED OUT WHERE WE HAD OUR LOCKER WHERE YOUR CLOTHES WE WERE IN UNIFORM NOW OF ALL OUR CIVILIAN CLOTHES HAD GONE SO WE JUST HAD A NAVAL CLOTHES THE FIRST THINGS WE HAD TO DO GO THROUGH AS THE TRIALS WERE TAKEN UP THE CLYDE YOU HAD TO DO THE SPEED WHATEVER DETERMINED AND A FEW GUNNERY TRIALS ANYWAY WHEN WE FINISHED THE TRIALS AND THE SHIP WAS COMMISSIONED THEN INTO THE ROYAL NAVY THAT WAS THE TIME WAS GOING TO BE OFF NONE OF US WAS TOLD THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO ON A CERTAIN DAY SO IF WE HAPPENED TO BE HAVING SHORE LEAVE WE COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY BUT THEN ONE DARK NIGHT AFTER WE FINISHED OUR TRIALS WE SLIPPED FROM THE DOCK DOCKSIDE OF THE YARD THE OTHER YARD AND EDGED OUR WAY UP THROUGH THE CLYDE NO LIGHTS OF COURSE WE CLOSED ALL THE WATER TIGHT DOORS ALL THE SCUTTLES ALL THE DEAD LIGHTS AND WE WERE GIVEN OUR IONS THAT WE WERE ON WATCH THEN WE WERE REAL SAILORS THEN SO I WAS STARBOARD WATCH SO THERE FOR I WOULD BE UP ON THE HALF AN HOUR ON THE STARBOARD LOOKOUT WE WE NEVER HAD ANY ACTUAL TRAINING FOR THIS WE JUST WERE TOLD TO DO WHAT WE WERE TOLD SO ANYWAY WE EASED OUT OF THE CLYDE YOU HAVE TO GO PAST THE BOOM WHICH LET YOU OUT OF THE TIDE DE I REMEMBER I CAME OFF WATCH OR HADN'T GONE ON WATCH I CAN'T REMEMBER AT THIS STAGE BUT I HAD REASON TO GO TO THE HEADS WHICH ARE THE TOILETS I'D SIT DOWN JUST SITTING DOWN THERE 'S AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION BANG THE OARS RATTLED PULL MY TROUSERS UP QUICKLY RUSHED OUT OF THE DOOR INTO THE WHAT THEY CALLED THE CANTEEN FLAT THAT'S JUST PASSAGEWAY AND BUMPED INTO ONE OF THE OTHER SAILORS WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERIENCE IN ME I SAID WE'VE BEEN TORPEDOED AND OUR NIGHT IT'S ONLY TORPEDO AND TRYING TO CHARGE IT OUT BUT SHAME FACED I DIDN'T GO BACK HE SAID WELL YOU WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE THERE ANYWAY SO WE HAD A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT THAT ANYWAY FROM THERE AS I SAY IT WAS A DARK NIGHT IT ALL SO CLANDESTINE WHEN YOU LEFT WELL THIS IS ONE THE PROBLEMS THE ENEMY KNEW THAT THERE WAS SHIPS BEING BUILT NEARLY ALL THE TIME AND THEY WOULD COME OUT OF THE CLYDE OR COME OUT OF THE TIME OR PERHAPS COME OUT OF IRELAND AND YOU CAN VISUALIZE IRELAND AND SCOTLAND IT NARROWS IT'S REALLY WIDE LONG DISTANCE BUT IT NARROWS AS A CONTINENT AND THEREFORE SHIPS HAVE TO COME IN AND OUT OF THAT AREA WELL THIS WAS ALWAYS THE PLACES WHERE YOU'D HAVE TWO OR THREE U BOATS JUST LURKING HOPING FOR A GOOD KILL AND WHETHER THEY EVER FOUND OUT THAT A SHIP FROM ANY SPIES OR ANYTHING WAS COMING OUT AT THAT TIME I'VE NO IDEA BUT THAT WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS PART BECAUSE NONE OF US HAD WORKED TOGETHER WE'D ALL COME OUT OF TRAINING AND WE'D HAD GOOD TRAINING IN OUR OWN JOBS BUT OF COURSE NOT AS A TRAINING WERE NOT WITH THE SAME PEOPLE WE WERE TRAINING WITH FROM THERE ONWARDS YOU UP FOR HEBRIDES IT WAS REALLY THE FEW SAILORS EXPERIENCED AND THE OFFICERS OF COURSE YOU WERE EXPERIENCED HAD TO HAVE ALL THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO DO WHAT YOU WERE DOING BECAUSE YOU'D GET NO ESCORT OR SHIP COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN WITH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CREW THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TO SEA BEFORE EVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP BEFORE VERY OFTEN IF WE'D BEEN ATTACKED AT THAT TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SITTING DUCK ARRIVED AT SCAPA FLOW WHICH IS RELATIVELY SAFE WE GO THROUGH THE BOOM AGAIN TO GET INTO THE FLOW AND FROM THEN ONWARDS TO DO OUR TRAINING THE TRAINING THAT SCAPA FLOW REALLY IS TO GET YOUR WORKING AS A TEAM THE WHOLE SHIP HAS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING A GUN CREW FOUR OR FIVE HAS TO KNOW HOW TO WORK TOGETHER IF YOU WERE IN THE TRANSMITTING STATION WHICH IS ONE OF THE NURSE CENTRES LIKE WE WERE AS GUNNERY CONTROL YOU HAVE ABOUT TEN PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM IT WAS ONLY THE SIZE OF AN ORDINARY SITTING ROOM AND EACH ONE OF THOSE HAD A JOB TO DO BECAUSE ON A DESTROYER WHICH WE WERE WAS A DESTROYER A BRAND NEW RUN AS WELL SO NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO WE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE FIRE CONTROL TABLE AS IT WAS WHERE YOU GOT EIGHT PEOPLE ON IT ALL THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THEY'RE TRAINED ON SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THE TRAINING THEY STILL HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT IF THE SHIPS ATTACKED OR IF WE SHOULD ATTACK ANOTHER SHIP THAT WAS WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF US IN THE FLOW TIME WE WERE SO SHORT OF DESTROYERS IN PARTICULAR AND OTHER ESCORT SHIPS SO NOT ONLY WERE WE STAYING IN A SAFE AREA TO DO OUR TRAINING WE WERE SENT OUT IN HARNESS AS IT WAS CALLED WITH ANOTHER SHIP THAT MIGHT BE MORE EXPERIENCE BUT THEN OF COURSE THERE IS ONLY ONE OF YOU THAT EXPERIENCE AND ONE WHICH IS TRAINING WHICH IS US WE LEARNT IT THE HARD WAY ALL OUR REAL FIGHTING WAS AROUND THAT TIME AT THE END OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH WAS OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER WAS AROUND THAT AREA SO THEY WOULD SEND US OUT WITH ANOTHER SHIP AND THIS IN ONE CASE WE WERE THE ONLY SHIPS THAT WERE IN THE FLOW DESTROYERS AND WE WERE OF COURSE DUTY DESTROYER MS BULLEN WHICH WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AT THAT TIME WAS A SHIP SUNK SO WE WERE SENT OUT AND THE BASIC TRAINING ON THIS WE HAD A CALL TO GO TO A SHIP OFF CAPE WRATH THAT HAD BEEN SUNK NOW WHAT HAD BEEN TORPEDOED DIDN'T ACTUALLY OUR MESSAGE WAS NOT THAT IT HAD BEEN SUNK A SHIP HAD BEEN TORPEDOED AND TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO GO OUT TO TRY AND HELP TO CATCH THE U BOAT THAT HAD SUNK TO PICK UP SURVIVORS IF THERE WERE ANY THERE THERE WAS TWO OF US AND IT SEEMED FROM THE RECORDS I LOOKED UP THE OTHER SHIP THAT WENT OUT WITH US WAS ANOTHER SHIP THAT WAS ALSO WORKING OUT TWO DESTROYERS WITH ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL I HAD TO GO OUT TO THIS SHIP I FOUND OUT LATER IN LIFE IT WAS HMS BULLEN WHICH WAS A ESCORT VESSEL AND THEY'D BEEN LOOKING FOR A U BOAT THE VERY U BOAT THEY'D BEEN LOOKING FOR HIT ONE OF OUR SHIPS FIRST SO MS BULLEN THAT HAD BEEN SUNK AND OTHER SHIPS THAT WERE WITH US WERE STILL LOOKING FOR THE U BOAT WELL THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS I WAS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE VERY EXPERIENCED AND HE WENT TO THE POSITION WHERE WHERE THE U BOAT HAD SUNK S EDGE OF HIS BULLEN NOBODY WAS TOLD ANYTHING HE KNEW IT'S A MISSILE AND NONE OF US WERE TOLD THE FIRST THING YOU DO YOU GO AROUND DEPTH CHARGE IN THE WHOLE OF THE AREA IN CASE THE U BOAT IS STILL THERE WELL WE PICKED UP AN ECHO TOLD OUR ASIA OPERATOR THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DOWN THERE WHICH COULDN'T BE THE U BOAT SO WE DEPTH CHARGE THAT AREA AND APPARENTLY THE ECHO WE DIDN'T MOVE IT STAYED THERE SO WE ASSUMED THAT THAT WAS A U BOAT AND NEVER CAME UP NEVER GOT ANY I NEVER GOT ANYTHING SO AT THAT TIME OF THE WAR THE SNAKE HAD ONLY JUST STARTED SO THEM OUT ALL IN THE WAR NOW THIS U BOAT IF IT DIDN'T COME UP WITHIN TWELVE HOURS THEN IT WAS A DEAD DUCK WE WAITED AROUND THERE ALL NIGHT WITH A BOARDING PARTY READY TO GO ON TO THE U BOAT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME UP FOR HER IF IT HAD BEEN AND THEN IT SEEMS WE HAD TO GO ON ANOTHER JOB I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE BUT WE HAD TO GO ON AN ESCORT JOB WE STOOD DOWN THE WHOLE TEAM I WAS LOOKING THIS IS THE NEXT MORNING WE STOOD ON THE TEAM OF THE BOARDING PARTY AND I WAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE OF THE SHIP I HAD NO WORK TO DO I WAS OFF WATCH AND I COULD SEE IN THE NEAR DISTANCE A MAGNETIC MINE FLOAT PAST NOBODY SHOT AT IT WHICH THEY MIGHT ONE USUALLY JUST IN CASE THERE WAS A NEW BOAT DOWN HE WOULD KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL THERE WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE ALL NIGHT STARTED YOUR ENGINES BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT U BOAT IF IT WERE STILL ALIVE THERE DOWN THERE TO KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL UP THERE WAITING SO IN THE END WE WENT BACK TO SCAPA FLOW AND CARRIED ON WITH OUR LEARNING TO FIGHT THE WAR TELL ME ABOUT CHRISTMAS IN SCAPA WELL THIS WAS THIS THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT WAS THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER SMALL JOBS WE MIGHT HAVE DONE THERE I'M NOT SURE BUT THE NEXT IMPORTANT THING I CAN REMEMBER IS WE WERE NOT REQUIRED FOR WORK AROUND THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD SO WE WERE BACK IN SCAPA FLOW AND IT WAS QUIET AND WE WERE SAFE BUT NONE OF US HAD A CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME BEFORE THIS AND THERE WE ALL WERE IN A DEAD PLACE SCAPA FLOW SCAPA FLOW IS A TERRIBLE PLACE DEAD AS ANYTHING WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS THERE'S TWO HUNDRED ON THE SHIP ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED SHIPS COMPLEMENT AND LUCKILY WE HAVE A FEW AMONGST US THAT WERE EXPERIENCED AND THERE WE WERE THE MESS WERE MAKING CHRISTMAS CAKES WITH WHATEVER STUFF WE COULD GET HOLD OF YOU ALSO MANAGED TO GET SURE WHERE FROM A CHRISTMAS TREE FOR SOMEWHERE AND THAT IS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE MAST ON THE TOP OF EVERY SHIP AT CHRISTMAS TIME THEY'RE IN HARBOUR THEY HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE WHICH IS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE SHIP AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED I THINK BY THE OFFICERS BEING CHRISTMAS BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER WE WERE OR NOT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE DRINK ON BOARD IT'S A DRY SHIP AT SOME OF THE OLD STAGES THAT HAD SAVED SOME OF THEIR RUM RATION WHICH YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO VERY VERY HIGH CHARGE AS YOU WERE CAUGHT BUT THE OFFICERS NORMALLY ON A SMALL SHIP LIKE A DESTROYER CLOSE YOUR EYES TO LOTS OF THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO IF THEY WERE ON A BIG SHIP THAT YOU CALL A PASSER SHIP SO MANY OF THE LADS THAT WERE ALLOWED RUM I WASN'T BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO RUM UNTIL YOU'RE TWENTY AND I WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN BUT OUT CAME THE RUM RATION HORRIBLE I HATE IT AND MADE UP THINGS OUT OF PAPER I THINK PACKAGING PAPER RED GREEN AND BLUE CAME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES OUT OF HIDE HOLES AND MADE INTO DECORATIONS AND WE WERE MOORED AT A BOY THERE AT THE TIME AND SINGING CHRISTMAS SONGS SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAD INSTRUMENTS WE HAD A SMALL BAND ON BOARD SOME OF THE PEOPLE I SUPPOSE SOME OF OUR LADS WHO COME FROM HOMES THAT NEVER BAD IT WAS VERY TEARFUL FOR THEM I CAME FROM HOME THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY SO CHRISTMAS WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FOR ME SO ANYWAY WE ALL ENJOYED OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME AND YOU KNOW SCAPA FLOW THAT WAS QUITE A COMMANDER WILKINSON WAS CAPTAIN EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A LIFE FOR HIM REALLY AFTER WE'D BEEN WITH HIM FOR A TIME BECAUSE ALTHOUGH HE WAS VERY STRICT HE WAS QUITE HAPPY TO TURN HE WAS A LAD THE SAME AS US LATER ON IN THE STORY WHEN WE GOT A FAR EAST I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT WE HAD MULTI POLO TEAMS AND HE WAS ON THE TEAM WITH THE LADS AGAINST THE OFFICERS AND THAT WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON HE WOULD BE AND HE WAS BOXING CHAMPION OF THE FLEET OR PART OF THE FLEET AND HE WAS SUCH A NICE PERSON YOU KNOW AND THERE IS ANOTHER CASE I'LL TELL TELL YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE WHEN I GO ASHORE BUT THE NEXT THING WE WENT ON AFTER CHRISTMAS AFTER CHRISTMAS WAS WHEN WE REALLY STARTED LEARNING THAT THERE WAS A WAR ON WE WOULD STILL GO OUT WOULD STILL GO OUT AS A SHIP WORKING UP TOGETHER BUT THE FIRST ONE WE WENT OUT WITH I BELIEVE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND THIS WAS TO BE A STRIKE AGAINST NORWAY WE DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE AT SEA DOING THIS BUT THERE WAS THE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS SOME MORE DESTROYERS AND OTHER SHIPS AIR JOB WAS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT ONE OF THE CARRIERS BUT IT WAS ALSO TO ACT AS A LIFEBOAT REALLY WHEN THE AIRCRAFT TOOK OFF AND A COUPLE OF THESE WERE OLD TYPE AIRCRAFT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THEY WERE BIPLANES NOW THIS WAS A REALLY ROUGH DAY AND THEY TOOK OFF I WATCHED THEM I WASN'T ON WATCH ALL THE TIME AND I WATCHED THEM FROM THE DECK AND THE CARRIER WAS BOUNCING UP AND DOWN BUT THEY TOOK OFF AND THEY CARRIED OUT OR TRIED TO CARRY OUT THEIR TASK BUT THE TWO SHARE COME BACK DIDN'T MAKE IT AS THE SHIP WAS DANCING UP AND DOWN THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER DANCING UP AND DOWN AND I BELIEVE ONE OF THEM HIT THE DECK PUSHED OVERBOARD THAT'S WITH THE PEOPLE IN IT THEY CAN'T TAKE THEM OUT PUSHED THEM OVER TO MAKE WAY FOR ANOTHER ONE LANDING AND THE OTHER ONE DISAPPEARED I THINK HE WAS GIVEN ORDERS TO TRY AND FLY BACK TO HIS BASE OR A BASE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH TO LAND ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER WE BEING CRASH BOAT WAS CALLED WE WENT TO TRY AND FIND THE AIRCRAFT THAT WAS DITCHED SAD OR NO AIRCRAFT SO ANYWAY I THINK THEY HAD TO CALL OFF CAUSE IT WAS JUST TOO TOO DANGEROUS TO DO ANY MORE FLYING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT WAS REALLY A BAD BEGINNING MY WAR WE WENT BACK TO SCARPA TALK ABOUT IT BEING ROUGH HOW WERE YOUR SEA LEGS TERRIBLE I WAS SEASICK MOST TIMES I WENT TO SEA BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU WERE ON THE LOOKOUT OR WHEN YOU'RE IN THE TS WHICH IS A THE TS IS DOWN BELOW AND THAT IS THE TRANSMITTING STATION THAT TAKES THE A RELAY FROM THE DIRECTOR TOWER WHICH IS RIGHT UP AT THE TOP OF THE SHIP THROUGH ITS TO THE MAIN ARMAMENT WHICH IS FOUR FOUR INCH GUNS SO I WAS A COMMUNICATION NUMBER SO THE DIRECTOR WOULD SPEAK TO ME THE OFFICER TWO OFFICERS IN THE DIRECTOR WOULD BE SPEAKING TO ME AND I WOULD BE SPEAKING TO THE GUNS BUT APART FROM THAT THE DIRECTOR WOULD HAD INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD SEND SIGNALS DOWN TO OUR BIG TO THE ORIGINAL MECHANICAL COMPUTER AND THE MECHANICAL COMPUTER WE'D SEND THAT INFORMATION MECHANICALLY TO THE GUNS BUT ONCE I GOT INTO A POSITION WHERE THERE WAS EXCITEMENT I FORGOT ALL ABOUT SEA SICKNESS THAT WAS A GOOD THING BUT NORMALLY IF I WASN'T ON ONE WATCH I WAS STANDING I'D BE STANDING ON THE UPPER DECK WATCHING THE SEA HEAVING UP AND DOWN AND BE SICK THE ONLY TIME YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS IS WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING ACTION YOU KNOW LATER ON TALK ABOUT THE MINE LAYING WE WERE AT ACTION STATIONS ALL THE TIME BUT IF YOU'RE DOING A JOB JUST ESCORTING YOU'RE AT CRUISING STATIONS UNTIL SOME TROUBLE POPS UP AGING U BOATS IS NOT A CASE OF GOING TO ACTION STATIONS IT'S ONLY IF THE U BOAT FIGHTS BACK THEN YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS SO ANYWAY WE WENT FROM THERE BACK TO SCAPA FLOW I THINK WE DID ONE OR TWO JOURNEYS LIKE THIS OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN FORTY FIVE EVENTUALLY WE SUPPOSEDLY FINISHED OUR TRAINING OF WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM MIND YOU ALL THIS TIME I'M TALKING TO YOU ABOUT NOW WE WERE STILL LEARNING BECAUSE WE WERE STILL TEAMING UP WITH PEOPLE THAT WE NEVER WORKED WITH BEFORE IF WE'D RUN INTO ANY REAL TROUBLE AT THAT TIME WE WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD A LOT OF CHANCE IT WAS LATER ON WHEN WE HAD LEARNT THESE THINGS SO THE NEXT ONE I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT ONE IS IN ABOUT FEBRUARY I BELIEVE WE JUST TOLD WE WERE GOING OUT THAT NIGHT WE WERE NOT GIVING ANY REAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE WE WERE GOING OR WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO BUT IT WAS A VERY BIG DO THERE WAS A VERY LARGE FORCE WE LEFT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT I BELIEVE IS THAT THE FIRST SCAPA THIS IS OUT OF SCAPA AND THIS THIS IS WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE MINE LAYING OPERATION IT WAS A VERY ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO MOON IT WAS ALL STARLIGHT IT WAS A VERY GOOD VISIBILITY AND IT WAS A VERY CALM NIGHT STRANGE ENOUGH HARDLY ANY ROUGH SEA OR ANYTHING WE SET OUT AND YOU SELDOM KNOW WHO'S WITH YOU IT'S THE SILENCE SERVICE YOU'RE NOT TOLD ANYTHING WE'D BEEN ABOUT OUT AN HOUR I BELIEVE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AND THE SKIPPER THEN SAID OVER TO TURN WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO HE OPENED HIS ORDERS AND HE TOLD US WE WERE A BIG FORCE ONE OF THE LARGE FORCE WERE GOING DOWN THE SOUTHERN PART OF NORWAY TO EGESUND AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY WE WERE JUST ONE OF TWO SHIPS THE OTHER ONE WAS EZELIUS THE SAME SIZE OF THE SAME DESTROYER AS WE WERE AND OUR MAIN TASK WE HAD TO ESCORT THIS MINE LAYER APOLLO FIRST OF ALL BOTH FORCES WORKING TOGETHER HAD TO PASS THROUGH A BIG MINE FIELD THERE WAS A BIG MINE FIELD THAT WAS LAID BY US AND WE HAD TO GO THROUGH ONE PATH FOR IT WHICH WAS THE ONLY PATH THROUGH IT BUT WE KNEW WHERE THE OPENING WAS SO IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE ENOUGH BUT YOU DO GET LOOSE MINES SO OUR AS DEC OPERATOR HAD TO PICK OUT THE MINES THE AND I WAS ON WATCH AT ONE TIME AND I COULD HEAR HIM SAY THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE PORT SIDE AND THE CAPTAIN WOULD MOVE THE SHIP OVER A BIT SO ANYWAY WE THE MINE FIELD ALL OF US WERE NO REAL PROBLEM AND THEN WE SPLIT UP WE WERE TO WAIT UNTIL TWELVE O'CLOCK AT THAT TIME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE OTHER BIG FORCE WE WERE BY THE WAY DAVE AT THAT POINT AND THE OTHER BIG FORCE WAS TWO CRUISERS I THINK NO AIRCRAFT CARRIER AT THAT POINT AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY CONVOY THAT WAS GOING TO LEAVE EGELAND WAS GOING TO THE COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO SAVANNA WHERE WE WERE THE OTHER FORCES TO STOP AND GETTING THERE SO DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK THE OTHER FORCE WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE CONVOY AND THEY WERE HOPING IN THAT WHEN THAT STARTED THERE WOULD BE LOTS OF FIREWORKS DOWN FURTHER ALONG THE COAST IT WAS QUITE A FEW HUNDRED MILES BUT THAT WOULD TAKE THE HEAT OFF WHAT WE WERE DOING A CLANDESTINE OPERATION WE WERE ESCORT THE APOLLO TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WAS GOING TO START LAYING MINES DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK AND WE WERE TO BE BETWEEN HER AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND IF SHE WAS SIGHTED ON BY THE GERMANS OR PICKED UP BY RADAR BY THE GERMANS AND THEY WERE TO START FIRING WE WERE TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS WE COULD UP AND DOWN THE BIT OF SEA BETWEEN US AND BETWEEN THE APOLLO AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND USE ALL THE GUNS AND FLARES AND EVERYTHING YOU COULD TO TAKE THE HEAT OFF HER SO THEY WOULD ATTACK US THE APOLLO WOULD HAVE EITHER FLUSHED US OR INDICATED TO US OR NOT ON THE SHORE BECAUSE YOU COULD GIVE HAD TO KEEP RADIO SILENCE AND WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO SMOKE SHOW ANYTHING YOU WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO BANG BECAUSE THE NOISE WE WERE NOT FAR AWAY FROM THE COAST TO AND BUT THE SHIPS BOTH US AND THE OTHER ESCORT DESTROYERS LES HAD TO KEEP UP AS MUCH STEAM AS WE COULD BECAUSE IF THE FIREWORKS STARTED WE WERE TO HAVE TO SPEED RUSH UP AND DOWN THIS BIT OF COAST FIRING WHATEVER WE COULD TO PREVENT THE APOLLO WELL I COULD HEAR FROM THE GUNS BECAUSE I WAS IN THE TS AND FROM THE DIRECTOR STARTED DOING ANYTHING AND I COULD HEAR THE PEOPLE OF THE GUN SAYING WELL I SEE THE HEADLIGHTS THERE THEY'RE JUST JUST OVER THERE A LITTLE BIT THE CAR COMING DOWN GOING FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT AND I COULD HEAR ALL THIS THEY SAY THEY CAN'T SEE US FROM WHERE THEY ARE AND THEN HE SAID RIGHT THEY'VE STARTED DOWN THE OTHER END AND THEY STARTED FIRING DOWN AT THE OTHER END THEY ATTACKED THIS CONVOY AND THEY WERE YOU COULDN'T SEE THE WE COULDN'T I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING ANYWAY BECAUSE I WAS DOWN IN THE TS BUT I WAS GETTING ALL THE MESSAGES FROM NOT THE TWO OFFICERS UP IN THE TOWER BUT FROM MY MATES ON A GUN GUN X GUN AND GUN THEY WERE FUNNELING ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE SAID LOOK I THINK THAT BLOWS SMOKING OVER THERE YOU KNOW ON THAT THEY CAN'T SEE US ANYWAY APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO MUCH SO WE WERE SLOWLY CRUISING UP AND DOWN THE APOLLO STARTED LAYING OUR MINES ON TIME DAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK THE MINE LAYER IS A BIG MINE LAYER OF MINES BIG CRUISER THEY ARE AND ONCE THEY START LAYING THE MINE AND THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME IN THEY CAN'T STOP THEY'VE GOT TO DO THE WHOLE OF THEIR MINE LAYING BECAUSE THE MINE FOR IS BEING LAID SO THEY CAN'T TURN BACK THEY CAN ONLY GO ON AND CARRY ON LAYING THEIR MINDS SO ANYWAY WE'RE JUST GOING SLOWLY UP AND DOWN BECAUSE OUR SHIP WAS KEEPING STEAM UP READY FOR A QUICK DASH UP AND DOWN THE VALVE BLEW GOT A NORMAL IS A WELL KNOWN DESTROYER WHO WHO WHO WHO WHICH WE DO EVERY TIME YOU COME IN AND OUT OF HARBOUR JUST TO SIGNAL AND APPARENTLY EVERYBODY WENT MAD THE CRUISER WEREN'T MAD I WAS IN SILENT ROUTINE YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT WE WERE NEVER USED OUT NOT TO THE VERY END AND I THINK IT MIGHT EVEN BE IF ANYBODY HAD HEARD THAT WHOOP WHICH HAS A WELL KNOWN BRITISH DESTROYER SIGNALLED TO SAY YOU KNOW I'M COMING INTO HARBOUR OR SOMEWHERE YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T BE A BRITISH DESTROYER NOT BEING IS DAFT ENOUGH TO DO A THING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW SO ANYWAY THEY LAID THEY LAID THE MINES AND THEN WE KNEW I DON'T KNOW BY SIGNAL OR WHAT SHE SAID ALL DONE WE CARRIED OUT OUR MISSION SEE YOU BACK IN PORT AND I WAS AT THAT TIME LISTENING TO SOME OF THE MINE AND THEY WERE SAYING LOOK AT HER MOVE AND SHE WAS DOING FORTY KNOTS SHE WAS ONE OF THE FASTEST SHIPS THERE WERE AND THEY COULD SEE WAVE IS NIGHT BUT IT WAS STARLIGHT AND YOU COULD SEE YOU COULD SEE THE SHORE YOU COULD SEE THE PLACE WHERE THE GUNS WERE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A CRACK AT US AS THEY'D KNOWN AND AWAY WENT THE APOLLO AND AT SPEED AND WE TURNED AROUND BUT WE WENT AS FAR AS YOU COULD BUT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO A GOOD SPEED BECAUSE WE GOT A SIGNAL THAT THE GERMANS SET OUT THAT THEY WERE BEING ATTACKED ESPECIALLY FROM EGASUND WITH THE BATTLE WE HAD ON DOWN THERE AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE AFTERWARDS ON THE APOLLO WHEN I TOUCH OF THEM THEY SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD AND THEY WERE IN THE WHILE IT'S A TELEGRAPH OFFICE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT WE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED ALTHOUGH FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BECAUSE THEY HAD PICKED US UP ON RADAR THE FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED AND HE THINKS THAT THE APOLLO WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF COURSE HAD GIVEN THE RIGHT CHALLENGE ANSWER BUT THEN THEY CHALLENGED AGAIN LATER ON AND DIDN'T BECAUSE THE APOLLO HAD STARTED DISAPPEARING SO THEY SENT TORPEDO BOMBERS AFTER US AND THEY NEVER FOUND US SO WE GOT BACK SO THE MIND BE SUCCESSFUL OR FORCE DOWN FURTHER IN CASES HAD STOPPED THE CONVOY GOING UP THE GERMAN CONVOY THEY HAD SUNK ONE OR TWO OF THE SHIPS AND ONE OR TWO OF OUR SHIPS HAD INJURED PEOPLE BUT THE WHOLE MISSION WAS SUCCESSFUL IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU WERE EXPENDABLE WHEN YOU ARE OUT THERE WITH THE POLE I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE DESTROYER WAS A VALUABLE BIT OF KIT TALK A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF DESTROYER AND IT'S COMFORTABLE BECAUSE WHAT I SHALL BRING IN IS BECAUSE LATER ON WHEN THE END OF THE WAR WHICH IT WON'T BE THAT ONE WHEN WE WERE A BIG FORCE ESCORTING SOME OF THE CRUISERS OUT TO THE FAR EAST WE ONLY TOOK THEM AS FAR AS GIBRALTAR YOU SEE AND THEN ANOTHER FORCE TAKES OVER BUT WE WERE ESCORTING A BATTLESHIP THE RENOWN AND WE WERE THE CLOSE ESCORT ONE DESTROYER EACH SIDE FAIRLY CLOSE WHEREAS OTHERS WERE FURTHER OUT AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY LIKE THIS AND I WASN'T ON MY JOB JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE BUT WE WERE CLOSE BECAUSE OF A CLOSE ESCORT YOU SEE AND I'M JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE AND OVER THE TANNOY COMES A VOICE FROM THE CAPTAIN WE'RE NOW REACHING A DANGEROUS AREA AND THERE MIGHT BE U BOATS AROUND IF A U BOAT HAS FIRED A TORPEDO AND THAT IS AND WHAT IS IT WE SEE THE TRACK OF THAT TORPEDO HEADING TOWARD BIG SISTER WHICH THEY CALLED THE RENOWN THEN WE STOP IT YOU KNOW WHAT WE MEAN IT AND THERE'S ME LOOKING OVER THE SIDE LOOKING AT THE TORPEDO BULGE ON THE RENOWN AND THINKING TO YOURSELF YES YOU'RE GONG TO LOSE TWO HUNDRED MEN JUST AS A TORPEDO BENDING LITTLE TORPEDO BULGE YOU KNOW JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF A DESTROYER ROLE OF MOST DESTROYERS IS THERE FAST MANEUVERABLE AND THEY'RE LIKE A SMALLER VERSION OF A CRUISER THEY HAVE ALL THE GUNNERY BUT SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'VE GOT FOUR BIG GUNS FOUR POINT FIVE GUNS OTHER SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'VE GOT ALL THOSE THE ONE THING THEY'VE GOT EXTRA APART FROM THE SMALLER SIZE SCALE DOWN THE BIG SHIPS HAVE NOT GOT ANTI SUBMARINE EQUIPMENT THEY'VE GOT TORPEDOES AND THINGS BUT UNLESS THEY'RE SUBMARINES ON THE SURFACE THEY'VE GOT NO DEPTH CHARGES A DESTROYER HAS DEPTH CHARGES SO WE'RE THERE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIFFERENCE THE REASON WHY YOU GOT THE DESTROYER AS WELL IS JUST AS I SAID IF THE CAPITAL SHIP OR WHAT IS YOU'RE GUARDING IS TORPEDOED THE LAST RESULT IS YOU GETTING IN THE WAY OF THE TORPEDO LOSE A SHIP THAT ONLY GOT TWO TWO HUNDRED MEN ON BOARD THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MEN ON THE BATTLESHIP REMOTE AS IT MIGHT BE IF IT GOT A TORPEDO BULGE AND THIS IS WHY WE SORT OF SORT OF DESTROYERS BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM GET LOST BECAUSE THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN A TORPEDO IS SIGHTED IS TO GO TO ATTACK THE SUBMARINE THAT FIRED IT BE NEAR ENOUGH TO GET IN THE WAY OF A TORPEDO IF IT HAPPENS TO BE HEADING YOUR WAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALK A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WERE TEN YOU WERE VERY YOUNG CREW WAS THERE A MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE ON BOARD WHEN YOU THOUGHT WERE WORKING BRILLIANTLY KNOWN WELL NOT REALLY YOU JUST SORT OF FIT IN PART OF LIFE YOU MANAGED TO FIT INTO EVERY SITUATION IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH AND I NEVER WORRIED BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD SWIMMER YOU MUST BE A EVEN IF THE SHIP SINKS THEN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU SPEAK TO OTHER PEOPLE YOU'VE GOT SEA BOOTS ON AT THE TIME YOU HAVE A BELT WHICH SHOULD SAVE YOU WHICH YOU WEAR ALL THE TIME AT SEA BUT YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT BELT BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT GETS IN THE WAY OF YOUR ARMS AND EVERYTHING SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU HAVE TO JUMP INTO THE HOGGING AS THEY CALL IT THE SEA MUSTN'T BE BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT MIGHT BREAK YOUR ARMS SO YOU'RE EXPECTED TO BLOW THAT UP WHEN YOU HIT THE SEA AND I CAN'T SEE HOW YOU GET LUCKY I NEVER HAD TO BUT I HAVE SURVIVORS THAT HAVE TOLD ME YES I HAD TO BLOW IT UP AS SOON AS I HIT THE WATER AND I HAD NO BREATH AT ALL LEFT SO I COULDN'T BLOW IT UP BOATS DRAG IT OUT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE WEARING IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG EVENT THAT YOU RECALL THEM WELL IT WAS REALLY MUNDANE MOST OF THE THINGS EVEN AS ESCORT TO THE MONSTERS THAT WE DID YOUR ENEMY IN MOST CASES WAS SEA BATTERED LEFT RIGHT AND CENTRE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH QUEEN MARY AND QUEEN ELIZABETH BECAUSE AS WE TOOK THEM OUT OF THE CLYDE WE ZIGZAGGED ALL THE WAY WITH THEM AND WE KEPT UP WITH THEM UNTIL THEY REACHED THEIR TOP SPEED WHICH WAS THE DISTANT FURTHER ON THE WAY ACROSS AND THEN WE LEFT THEM AND WE EITHER WAITED AROUND FOR THE NEXT ONE COMING IN WE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN THE QUEEN MARY OUT AND MIGHT HAVE HAD TO WAIT JUST A FEW HOURS FOR QUEEN ELIZABETH TO COME IN AND ALL THE TIME ONE OF YOU MIGHT PICK UP ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU AS THE QUEEN MARY WOULD HAVE ITS OWN ASDIC BESIDES ITS OWN RADAR AND OF COURSE WERE AT THE ASDIC AND THE RADAR AND OUR COHORT PERHAPS THE CAVALIER WOULD BE THE SAME WELL WHEN WE'D STEAM OUT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE APART AT THE EXTREMES OF YOUASDIC CIRCLE RADAR CIRCLE SO YOU DIDN'T INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHER'S RESET THE WAVE AND IF WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUBMARINE YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN A WRECK WELL IMMEDIATELY WE'D RUN UP A BLACK FLAG ON OUR FLAG DECK SO THE QUEEN MARY WOULD KNOW AND THEY'LL THE CAVALIER WOULD KNOW THAT WE PICKED UP AN ECHO IMMEDIATELY WE'D HIVE OFF TO ATTACK THE ECHO THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE IN TROUBLE IT IS IF THAT'S A U BOAT IT MIGHT HAVE ALREADY FIRED ITS TORPEDO IS WHERE YOU TURN OFF SWIFTLY AT FULL SPEED IF YOU CAN IF YOU GOT A BEAM SEA YOU CAN TURN OFF LEFT OR RIGHT HIT WITH A BEAM S THE DESTROYER YOU GOT HARDLY ANY DRAFT YOU'D TURN OVER STRAIGHT AWAY SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY VERY CRATE YOU NEVER DID WHENEVER IT'S LUCK OR BY JUDGMENT I DON'T KNOW BUT ANYWAY THEN IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HIT BY A TORPEDO THEN YOU'D FIND YOUR WAY TO WHEREVER THAT ECHO WAS AND YOU WOULD ATTACK THE ECHO SO YOU'D LOOSE OFF ABOUT DEPTH CHARGES FROM ONE SIDE FROM THE OTHER AND ROLL OF THE TWO WRECKS FROM THE REAR SO PATTEN HIM ABOUT TEN CHARGES WELL IF THE U BOAT IS A VERY EXPERIENCED ONE AND HE WAS WATCHING YOU ON THE PERISCOPE HE WOULDN'T BE THERE WHEN YOU ARRIVED HE WOULD EITHER HAVE GONE DOWN LOW OR HE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BUT AT LEAST YOU KEPT HIM DOWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HITTING YOUR CHARGE AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO TRY TO CATCH IT UP HALF A DAY BECAUSE THEY'RE KEEPING THE SAME SPEED EVEN IF THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO LEAVE THE QUEEN MARY OR THE QUEEN ELIZABETH QUEEN MARY WOULD CARRY ON IT WOULDN'T STOP AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY'D ACTUALLY TORPEDOED TO QUEEN MARY THEN THEY WOULD HAVE LOST A LOT OF LIVES BECAUSE WHILE QUEEN MARY'S IF IT'S COMING BACK IN YOU'LL HAVE A FULL COMPLIMENT OF AMERICAN GIS AND THAT WOULD BE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND CARRYING NOW THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TIGHTEN UP THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING FROM THE DIFFERENT DECKS ALL THE TIME IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF WE GO INTO ACTION STATIONS THEN WE CLOSE OUR WATER TIGHT DOORS WHICH MEANS IF YOU'RE TORPEDOED YOUR MIND IT WILL ONLY DAMAGE THE COMPARTMENT WHERE WITHIN SO THE SHIP MOST LIKELY WON'T SINK IT'S ON THE QUEEN MARY THERE THEY'VE GOT NO CHANCE OF ANY OF THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BEING CLOSED BECAUSE THEY'RE TRAVELLING BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT DECKS THEY'RE PERHAPS SLEEPING ON ONE DECK TRAVELLING UP THE NEXT DECK TO EAT FOOD ANOTHER DECK FOR EXERCISE AND THE DECK IS ALWAYS EXERCISE SO THEY COULDN'T HAVE CLOSED THE CREW WATER FIGHT DOORS ANY OF THOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISASTERS YOU WOULD FIND WHAT WAS IT LIKE SEEING A QUEEN MARY QUEEN ELIZABETH THE SAILING ONE DID YOU HAVE ANY PRIDE WERE THE SHIPS THAT YOU KNEW OF AND WERE PROUD OF ANYWHERE ALL WE REALLY KNEW WAS THAT WE WERE GOING TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS OR BRING ONE OF THE MONSTERS IN IF IT WAS THE QUEEN MARY AND WE WERE IN GREENOCK THEN WE WOULD KNOW IT'S THE COME IN WHERE WE WERE TAKEN OUT AND THAT'S ALWAYS GOT THREE FUNNELS ANYWAY IF WE PICKED UP IF IT'S GOT THREE FUNNELS IT'S QUEEN MARY IT'S GOT TWO FUNNELS IT'S QUEEN ELIZABETH AND SO ON YOU GOT FOUR FUNNELS WITH THE AQUITANIA AND SO IT WENT ON BUT YOU WERE NEVER TOLD YOU WERE JUST OUT AND GO TO A RNDEVOT WHERE YOU WOULD WAIT AROUND OR YOU'VE ALREADY CONTACTED THAT SHIP TO SAY YOU'RE THERE AND YOU'D BRING IT IN VERY OFTEN EVEN WE TWO WERE ESCORTS ONE WOULD BE GREENOCK AT THE CLYDE AND THE OTHER WOULD BE DOWN AT LIVERPOOL AND WE WOULD REACH A POINT OF RENDEZVOUS GOING OUT OF THE CLYDE THE OTHER ONE THE CAVALIER PERHAPS COME OUT OF LIVERPOOL THEN WE'D STEAM UP TOGETHER TO RONDEVOOT POINT THE MONSTER THIS HAPPENED ALMOST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK OR ONE OR OTHER OF US WE NEVER HAD THE SAME COHORT BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T ALWAYS BE IN THE SAME AREA THEY'D BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE AND BETWEEN THAT IF YOU'RE A DUTY SHIP THERE WAS AIRCRAFT CARRIER WHICH HAPPENED IN ONE CASE HAD BEEN TORPEDOED WE'D JUST COME DOWN FROM SCAPA TO TO GREENOCK WE'D JUST ARRIVED AT THE HARBOUR ENTRANCE WE WENT STRAIGHT TO AN OILER BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO FILL UP WITH OIL BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO OUT AND JUST AS WE WERE AT THE OILER WE GOT AN EMERGENCY CALL TO SAY THAT AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER HAD BEEN TORPEDOED JUST IN CLYDE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CLYDE SO WE JUST THE OILER AND WE WENT STRAIGHT OUT TO THE THING IT WAS AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND STRANGELY ENOUGH SHE WAS ON HER OWN SHE HAD COME FROM DERRY SHE HAD NO ESCORT LUCKILY SHE DIDN'T HAVE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF SEAMAN AND SO FORTH AND SHE WAS COME INTO THE CLYDE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY TORPEDOED AT THE TORPEDOED A MERCHANT SHIP AT THE SAME TIME AND THE U BOAT GOT AWAY ALTHOUGH WE WENT TO ATTACK IT AND IT WAS DARK AND OTHERS I THINK LOOKING FOR THE U BOAT AFTERWARDS WHERE WE GOING BACK INTO HARBOUR HOW LONG ARE YOU AT SEA WHEN YOU WERE OUT IN THE ATLANTIC HOW OFTEN ARE YOU GOING BACK TO BASE AND GETTING LAND LOTS A DESTROYER NOT VERY LONG BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT MUCH FUEL AND THERE'S ALWAYS TOP SPEED ALWAYS MANEUVERING YOUR ONLY WAY OF GETTING FUEL IF YOU'RE OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS FROM ONE OF THE BIGGER SHIPS EITHER FROM AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER OR SOMETHING AS BIG AS A BELFAST A CRUISER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ALSO FOOD YOUR FOOD RUNS OUT AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE ONLY TIME WE WERE REALLY OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS WHEN WE WERE UP AT SCAPA WHEN YOU'RE WORKING UP WHEN WE ARE GOING OUT ON FOR AIDS TO HELP TO SINK THE TIP TURPITS OR DOING OTHER JOBS MOST OF THE OTHERS IT WAS A CASE OF GOING OUT JUST FOR A DAY OR TWO TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS AND THEN COME BACK WITH THE MONSTER OR TAKE ONE OUT AND LEAVE IT IN WHICH CASE WE'D HAVE TO GO TO LONDON DERRY PERHAPS AND THEN COME OUT OF LONDON DERRY AGAIN AND GO OUT ON THAT WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT RESPECT THAT WE WERE NOT OUT FOR VERY LONG THERE WAS ONLY ONE OCCASION WHEN WAS OUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME IT MUST HAVE BEEN OVER THE FIVE DAYS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE OCCASION WAS WE HAD RUN OUT OF FOOD WE WAS FURTHER UP IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC OUR CAPTAIN WAS A FISHERY FLEET MAN HE HAD HIS OWN FISHERY FLEET THEN WHAT HE DECIDED TO DO AS WE RUN OUT OF FOOD HE SAID I KNOW WHERE THE FISH ARE HE GUIDED THE SHIP UP TO WHERE HE KNEW THEY WERE PICKED UP A SHOVEL ON THE RADAR ON THE ASDECDROPPED AT A DEPTH CHARGE LOWERED THE BOAT PICKED UP THE FISH THAT CAME UP IT WAS STUNNED HE STOOD ON THE FOX WE SAW HIM SET ON THE FOX AND SAID PICK UP MY MIND PICKED THE ONE WE LIVED ON FISH FOR A FEW MORE DAYS AFTER THAT ONE BIG OUR RUNS WERE MOSTLY JUST ABOUT FIVE DAYS AT A TIME BUT THAT MEANT EVERY TIME WE CAME INTO EITHER SCAPA IF WE WERE IN LIVERPOOL OR TO THE CLYDE WE HAD TO ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF FUEL ON BOARD BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A DUTY DESTROYER AND THEN IF SOMETHING COMES UP WHERE THE SHIP'S BEEN SUNK YOU HAVE TO GO OUT STRAIGHT AWAY AND YOU MIGHT BE OUT FOR A LONG TIME A SUBMARINE OR MORE THAN ONE SUBMARINE WE WERE LUCKY IN THE FACT THAT WE NEVER WENT OUT FOR A LONG TIME OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OIL IN AT SEA WHICH IS A DANGEROUS PRACTICE ANYWAY PICKING UP FOOD AND EVERYTHING FROM IT CAN YOU DESCRIBE RADAR YES THIS IS A GOOD JOB YOU WERE DOING RADAR YES RADAR WELL FIRST OF ALL WHEN I WAS ON THE RADAR SET IT WAS ONLY A SMALL SET AND IT TYPES THE TWO NINE THREE IS HIGH UP ON THE MASK SPECIALLY FOR PICKING UP AIRCRAFT OR SURFACE SHIPS A DISTANCE I CAN'T THINK OF A RANGE OF IT BUT IT SENDS OUT A SIGNAL FROM THERE WHICH OF COURSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT ANYTHING YOU DON'T GET IT BACK IF IT HITS ANYTHING EVEN CLIFFS OR AN AIRCRAFT OR A SURFACE SHIP IT BALANCES BACK ON THE SCREEN WHICH IS AROUND SCREEN AND THE CURSOR IS GOING AROUND ALL THE TIME THAT WILL SHOW A BLIP AND THAT BLIP YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S A CLOUD WHICH IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE DEPENDS ON YOUR RADAR WHAT IT'S DOING VERTICAL OR ANGULAR AND YOU WILL THEN READ OFF THE DISTANCE AND THE ANGLE OF EVERYTHING THIS IS MOSTLY ON A LEVEL BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER SCREAM WHICH GIVES YOU THE HEIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT YOU USE ONE WITH THE OTHER WHEN THAT SIGNAL ELECTRONIC SIGNAL HITS ANYTHING THEN IT RETURNS AND THEN YOU READ OFF THE DISTANCE OF IT BUT IS IT EASY TO USE IT 'S EASIER TO USE WHERE YOU FIND A DIFFICULTY IS BY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT EITHER LAND BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF IT ON THERE OR IF IT'S A SMALL BLIP IT'S AN AIRCRAFT A SHIP OR WHATEVER IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE USING ONE TYPE OF RADAR IT'S ONLY ONLY HORIZONTAL IF YOU'RE USING ANOTHER ONE IT CAN BE HORIZONTAL OR AN AIRCRAFT AND YOU A GOOD DISTANCE THE TIME IT TAKES OF COURSE IT'S BASED ON IF IT TAKES TEN SECONDS TO GET FROM THERE TO THERE THEN IT'S READ IT OFF FROM THE SCREEN LUCKILY AT OUR POINT IN THE WAR WE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH AIRCRAFT THE ONLY TIME WE WOULD HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THAT IS IF THE TORPEDO BOMBERS HAD BEEN SENT AFTER US OFF NORWAY THEN YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO USE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD KNOW THE WE'D HAVE TO USE THE TWO RADAR SETS THEN THE ONE THAT GIVES YOU A SIGNAL IN THE HEIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT AND THE OTHER ONE WHICH GIVES YOU A DISTANCE OF IT THEN YOU'RE TRAINED TO KNOW WHICH THE DIFFERENCE AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT I CAN REMEMBER IF IT WAS ONE OF OUR OWN AIRCRAFT IT WOULD HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION SIGNAL WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW ON YOUR RADAR SET BEFORE IT GOT TO YOU YOU'D HAVE TO BE PRETTY WELL EXPERIENCED BUT MY TIME WAS NOT ALWAYS ON A RADAR SET YOU WERE SOMETIMES ON A LOOKOUT AS A SEAMAN WHERE YOU'RE SITTING UP IN A LOOKOUT BOX ON THE STARBOARD SIDE WAS MINE AND YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR AIRCRAFT WHICH WAS NOT VERY OFTEN SURFACE SHIPS OR MORE THAN LIKELY YOU ARE LOOKING OUT FOR A LITTLE TINY PERISCOPE WHICH IS VERY HARD TO SEE IN A ROUGHER ATLANTIC OR YOU MIGHT BE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE THE TRACK OF A TORPEDO COMING TOWARD YOU IN WHICH CASE YOU GET INTO A PANIC AND CALL OUT QUICKLY TO THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE THE CAPTAIN OR OFFICER OF THE WATCH AT THE TIME IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE IT'S ENCLOSED BUT IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE SO THE BRIDGE IS HERE YOU'VE GOT A LOOKOUT IN JUST HERE TO JUST CALL OUT TO THAT PERSON ON THE BRIDGE THE OFFICER SHIP BEARING RED FIVE GREEN FIVE YOUR POSITION IS ANGLE OF SIGHT IF IT'S AN AIRCRAFT AND YOU'D IMMEDIATELY LOOK AT IT AND DECIDE WHAT ACTION TO TAKE BUT IF YOU'RE ON THAT LOOKOUT POSITION WHICH WAS ON QUITE A LOT AS A SEAMAN IT'S ROUGH BECAUSE AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN ALL THE TIME A DESTROYER YOU'RE ALMOST A SUBMARINE AT TIMES THE WHOLE OF THE SEA COMES UP OVER YOU AND YOU GET KNOCKED BACK AGAINST THE SEARCHLIGHT AND IT'S VERY DAMP THAT IS VERY ROUGH UNCOMFORTABLE AND THIS IS WHAT YOU GET USED TO YOU USED TO WEAR A SPECIAL SUIT WHICH COVERED YOU COMPLETELY WATERPROOF SUIT WITH CAPE UP LINING BUT EVEN EVEN THAT THE WATER ALL THE WAY DOWN AND YOU GOT SOAKING WET I REMEMBER COMING OFF WATCH OCCASION LIKE THIS BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO CLIMB BACK DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE LADDERS OF THE SHIP BECAUSE THE DOORS THAT YOU WOULD GO IN AND OUT IN PORT WERE OPEN WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA THOSE DOORS WILL BE CLOSED BECAUSE THE WATER COMES IN THOSE SO YOU HAVE TO CLIMB DOWN LADDERS DOWN THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP NOT OUTSIDE IN THE SEA BUT CLIMB DOWN FROM THE TOP DECK TO THE LOWER DECK AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL THE WAVE IN IT HITS YOU YOU CAN GET WASHED AWAY HOLD ON VERY TIGHT WELL THIS WAS THE MIDDLE WATCH I CAN RECALL WHICH FROM TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING FOR TWELVE O'CLOCK AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BUT YOU'RE NOT ON WATCH LOOK OUT ALL THAT TIME OF THE FOUR HOUR WATCH YOU DO DIFFERENT JOBS HALF HOUR LOOKOUT HALF HOUR PERHAPS ON THE RADAR SET OF HALF HOUR BEHIND A GUN WHERE THERE'S A YOU BECOME PART OF THE GUN CREW SO IF YOU DID HAVE TO GO INTO ACTION DO THE SHOOTING WHILE THE REAL GUN CREW IS CALLED UP TO TAKE OVER FROM YOU WELL ON THIS OCCASION IT HAD BEEN VERY WET OUTSIDE I'D GOT SOAK IN AND TIRED I SAY MIDDLE WATCH PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK I'D COME DOWN SO I WENT DOWN TO MY MESS DECK WHICH IS IN THE FOCAL IT WAS A ROUGH PART OF THE SHIP I HADN'T SLUNG MY HAMMOCK I SLEPT ON THE AND THIS TIME I DIDN'T FANCY SLEEPING ON THE CUSHIONS BECAUSE THE SHIP WAS GOING SO MUCH THIS WAY AND I KNEW I'D COME OFF THE CUSHIONS SO I GOT DOWN UNDER THE MESS TABLE THERE WAS ABOUT THAT MUCH WATER ON THE FLOOR THE DECK NOT THE FLOOR ON THE DECK ABOUT THAT MUCH SO I GOT ALL MY CLOTHES ON THIS SUIT SUIT AS YOU CALLED IT AND EVERYTHING AND I'M LAYING DOWN TO SLEEP STRAIGHT AWAY THE NEXT THING I KNOW A FOOT HAD TOUCHED ME AND OPENED MY BLEARY EYES AND THERE WAS THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH LEADING SEAMAN OF THE MESS AND HE WAS SAYING TO ME I'M TOLD THIS IN THE MORNING BY THE LEADING HAND OF THE MESS HE SAID THE OFFICER SAID YOU COME ON SEAMAN YOU CAN'T SLEEP UNDER THERE IT'S TOO WET AND I SAID AND HE LOOKED AT THE LEADING HAND AND SAID WHAT DID HE SAY AND THE I DON'T KNOW I DON'T READ THAT LANGUAGE AND WELL WE'D BETTER LET HIM SLEEP THERE AND HE LEFT YOU THERE NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT IT WELL YOU'RE LYING IN THAT MUCH WATER THE DECKS OF THE SHIPS WERE INSIDE YOU INSIDE YOUR MESS DECK THE WATER JUST IT'S ONE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE AND A LITTLE BIT WARMER INSIDE SO YOU GET ALL HUMIDITY THE WATER RUNS DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE DECKS ANY TIME YOU'RE ON THE CAVALIER YOU HAVE A LOOK AND INSIDE BECAUSE YOUR METAL WORK AT THE SHIP'S SIDE IT'S ONLY ABOUT EIGHT OF AN INCH NO THICKER THAN THAT AND SO THERE THEY ARE WAY YOU'VE GOT WATER MOST OF THE TIME ON YOUR MESS DECKS WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA IN HARBOUR YOU'RE NOT TOO BAD IT GETS A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE THERE WAS ANOTHER TIME WHEN WE WORKED WITH QUEEN MARY AND WE HAD TO PICK HER UP TO BRING HER IN WE WENT OUT AND IT WAS ONE OF THE ROUGHEST STORMS WE HAD ABOUT THREE REALLY ROUGH STORMS IN THE PERIOD THAT WE WERE LOOKING IN THE ATLANTIC AND WE HAD TO AT THIS TIME I'D BE ABOUT MARCH NINETEEN FORTY FIVE WE HAD TO GO AND PICK UP QUEEN MARY THE STORM HAD BEEN RAGING ALL THE WAY FROM AMERICA IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BIG STORM THAT HAD COME ACROSS OUR WAY AND THE QUEEN MARY BROUGHT IT WITH A SORT OF THING AND WE PICKED HER UP AND I THINK WE WERE A DAY OR MORE WAITING TO PICK HER UP BECAUSE EVEN SHE HAD BEEN HELD UP BY THE BAD STORMS WELL AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAS THE SISTER SHIP AT THAT TIME BUT WE GOT REALLY BENT UP WE LOST A MOTORBOAT WE LOST ONE OF WHALERS WE GOT REALLY KNOCKED ABOUT WHEN WE GOT TOWARDS THE CLYDE THE QUEEN MARY KNOWING IT WAS IN THE AREA THERE WOULD BE U BOATS HAD TO RELY ON HER SPEED SO AS AS WE GOT WITHIN HAILING DISTANCE I SUPPOSE IF YOU SAY THE CLYDE THE QUEEN MARY DECIDED SHE COULDN'T SLOW DOWN TO KEEP UP WITH US BECAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH FOR US WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER SO SHE JUST FLASHED A MESSAGE SEE YOU IN THE CLYDE AND SHE KEPT UP HER SPEED AND GOT INTO THE CLYDE SHE HAD THE WHOLE OF THE FRONT OF HER BRIDGE STOVE IN AND IT WAS A BIG SHIP WELL UP IN THE AIR THEY HAD A LOT OF CASUALTIES BECAUSE THEY WERE CARRIED ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND TROOPS AND THIS WAS NOW LATE AT NIGHT I THINK ABOUT O'CLOCK OR TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT BUT ANYWAY SHE GOT INTO THE CLYDE WITHOUT ANYTHING BUT DAMAGE FROM THE SEA WE LIMPED IN LATER ON NOW IN THE CLYDE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ANCHOR AND WE COULDN'T GO FURTHER INTO GREENOCK TO GREENOCK BECAUSE AFTER THAT YOU GO THROUGH THE BOOM AND THE BOOM IS CLOSED AT NIGHT UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY SARY TO OPEN THE BOOM WHICH PREVENTS OR ELSE TO PREVENT BOATS GETTING AT THAT POINT SO AT THE OTHER SIDE WHERE WE HAD TO TIE UP TO A BOY WE HAVE TWO JUMPERS TO TIE UP TO A BOY YOU HAVE TO STOP AND YOU HAVE TO LOWER YOUR WHALER WITH THE BOY JUMPER AND THE ROWERS IN IT TO TAKE YOU TO THE BOY WITH THE CHAIN TO CLIP IT TO THE BOY WELL IF I'VE GIVEN YOU A PICTURE OF HOW ROUGH THE STORM WAS IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT FIRST WHALER WE DOWN ONTO THE WATER MANAGED TO GET DOWN SAFELY BUT GOT WASHED AWAY WITH THE CREW IN IT FURTHER DOWN THE CLYDE THAT WAS A WAY FOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO LOWER ANOTHER WHALER ALL OF US WAS UP ON THE FOLKS ALL THE SEAMAN THAT COULD HELP WAS UP ON THE FOLKS AND BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE YOUR ANCHOR YOU'RE JUST USING AN ANCHOR CHAIN WHICH GOES WITH A WIRE ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE ANCHOR CHAIN THE WHALER HAS TO TAKE THIS WIRE TO THE BOY TO CLAMP IT ONTO THE BOY AND THEN THE BOY IS PULLED BY THE ANCHOR CHAIN NEARER THE SHIP THE CLIP IT ON SO ANYWAY THEY LOWERED THE SECOND WHALER THE BOY JUMPER MANAGED TO GET ONTO THE BOY AND IN DOING SO BROKE HIS WRIST AND IN THE END IT WAS ABOUT FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO CLIP UP TO THE BOY AND THE CAPTAIN HAD TOPS ALL AROUND I HATED THE SMELL OF RUM ANYWAY AND NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD MY TOT BECAUSE IT'S HORRIBLE BUT I HAD IT THAT NIGHT BECAUSE WE WERE FROZEN FROZEN STIFF AND WE HAD TO GET AWAY WITH IT BUT NOTHING WAS EVER SAID ABOUT THIS TYPE OF THING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH PEOPLE AT THE PORTS KNEW THESE BIG SHIPS COME IN IT WAS A THING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THE GERMANS ALSO KNEW THEY WERE BRINGING ALL THESE LARGE NUMBERS BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS THAT COULD CARRY ANY OF THE U BOAT CAPTAINS I UNDERSTAND AND THIS IS NORMAL KNOWLEDGE WERE OFFERED A LARGE SUM OF MONEY THOUSANDS OF WHAT THE TONE MARKS DOSE MARK THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE HIGHEST OF THE HONOURS TO HAVE KNOCKED DOWN ANY ONE OF THESE MONSTERS WE NEVER LOST ONE FORTUNATELY IT TO SAY BUT THE QUEEN MARY WAS REALLY BATTERED VERY BADLY BATTERED HOW WE DIDN'T GET TURNED OVER I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BIG SEAS WHAT SORT OF SIDE ARE YOU TOOK WELL THE SEAS ITSELF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL IT'S GENERALLY KNOWN THAT SOME OF THE WAVES WERE SIXTY FOOT HIGH YOU THINK OF SIXTY GOING UP THAT WAY WHEN YOU GO UP TO THE WAVE AND YOU COME DOWN TO THE TROUGH YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOOT AND THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN CUT THROUGH THOSE WAVES THE BIG SHIPS OR THE SMALL SHIPS YOU ACTUALLY GO UP ON THAT WAVE AND THEN YOU FEEL IT AS YOU COME DOWN WITH A CRUNCH LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU UP TO THE NEXT ONE AND ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CORK SCREWING YOU'RE NOT STILL AND USED TO THIS AFTER THE FIRST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT ROOTED ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE YOU GO THROUGH NORMAL CORRECT FLATS THEY'RE CALLED A DESTROYER THE NORMAL CORRIDOR ON THE FLOOR ON A DESTROYER IS ABOUT THAT WIDE WELL WHEN YOU FIRST GO ABOARD ONE LIKE THAT AND IT WAS FAIRLY CALM WHEN YOU SET OUT SCAPA FROM GREENOCK BUT AS YOU WALK ALONG THE DECK COMES UP TO MEET YOU AS IT GOES UP AND YOU HIT YOUR FEET AS YOU GO DOWN ON THE DECK YOU KNOW IT THAT DECK HAS GONE AWAY AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN AND THIS HITS YOU FROM THE TOP AND THEN WELL THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE DOING THIS THIS BULK HE HITS AND ACTUALLY KNOW THAT BULK IT HITS YOU SO IN TIME YOU LEARNED TO WORK LIKE A SAILOR AND AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN YOU GO DOWN WITH IT AND COME UP WITH IT AND THAT'S YOU'LL FIND SAILORS WHEN YOU GET ASHORE THEY WORK WITH A ROLE WALK WITH A ROLE THAT IS JUST THAT WALKING ON THE SHIP SO AFTER THE END OF THE WAR RIGHT DAY RIGHT YOU'RE NOT FINISHED AND VIDA ITSELF WE WERE AS THE NINTH OF MAY WE WERE BRINGING IN THE OLDER FRANKS AND WE GOT NOTICED THAT THE PEACE HAD BEEN DECLARED FOR THE NEXT DAY WE WERE GOING INTO GREENOCK SO WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN THE LAST OF THE ONE SHIP CONVOYS BEFORE THE WAR ENDED IN GREENOCK I BELIEVE IT'S EITHER WEDNESDAY OR SUNDAY HALF THE SHIP'S COMPANY WAS ALLOWED LEAVE WHICH WASN'T ME I'M AFRAID I WASN'T ONE OF THE SHIPS COMPANY BUT THEY WENT ASHORE TO GREENOCK AND WE HAD A GOOD TIME SO THEN WE STILL CARRIED ON WITH SOME OF THESE CONVOYS AFTER THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS QUITE A FEW OF THE U BOATS THAT APPARENTLY MISSING THEM ONE OR TWO WENT TO BRAZIL OR WHATEVER THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE THAT IF THERE WAS A U BOAT AROUND THEY COULD HAVE KNOCKED DOWN SOME OF THE MONSTERS WERE STILL BRING HIM BACK IN BUT WE HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL BUT TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT ANYWAY WERE THEN DESTINED TO GO ACROSS TO THE TRY TO END THE JAPANESE WAR TWO BY TWO OUR FLOTILLA WENT IN FOR REFITS WE WENT IN FOR A REFIT LATE IN MAY JUNE BECAUSE WE WERE GOING OUT THERE ANYWAY BUT FORTUNATELY WHILE I WAS ON LEAVE TO GO OUT THERE THE SHIP WAS DOWN AT DEVONPORT BEING REFITTED THE WAR ENDED I STILL GOT A TELEGRAM TO SAY LEAVE EXTRA DAYS LEAVE EXNER WHEN WE CAME BACK TO THE SHIP WE STILL HAD TO GO OUT THERE BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING TO CLEAR UP AFTER THE WAR WELL THE WHOLE OF OUR FLOTILLA WE WERE OUT THERE THEN WE WERE THE LAST TWO AS WE WENT OUT GIBRALTAR MALTA ADEN AND PLACES LIKE THAT WE THOUGHT WE WERE IN FOR A LOVELY SUMAC CRUISE WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE WHEN WE GOT TO TRIAL THAT WAS OUR NAVAL BASE WE BASED AT TRIAL AND WERE ALSO BASED AT SINGAPORE OR WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE THIS WAS JUST ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THE WAR AND WE WERE CARRYING OUT AN EXERCISE WITH HMS SUSSEX AND ANOTHER SHIP AND THE CAPTAIN THE FLOTILLA LEADER WHO WAS ON HMS CESAR AND OURSELVES IN CAVALIER WERE ORDERED TO GO WITH THE SUSSEX TO A PROBLEM SO WE IMMEDIATELY WENT AT FULL SPEED WE WERE SENT TO JAVA WE STOPPED ON A COUPLE OF TROOP SHIPS ON THE WAY REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT BUT WE TOOK ON BOARD FULL DECK WAS COVERED WITH INDIAN TROOPS ARMED INDIAN TROOPS AND THE CAVALIER WAS THE SAME AND THE CAESAR WAS ALSO AND THE SUSSEX ANCHORED OUTSIDE SURABAYA BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GET IN WE COULD HARDLY GET IN BECAUSE THERE WAS A SUNKEN JAPANESE CRUISER IN THERE IN THE WAY SO CAESAR WENT IN FIRST BECAUSE SHE WAS A FLOTILLA LEADER TROOPS WE WERE IN SECONDS WE WERE SECOND AND THEN THE CAVALIER AFTERWARDS WE WENT IN IT WAS DAYLIGHT WE HAD ALL THESE TROOPS ON BOARD IF WE HAD ANY TROUBLE WE COULDN'T HAVE USED OUR GUNS BECAUSE LUCKILY WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE FROM THE SHORE WE CAME INTO SURABAYA WAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE AND THERE WAS BODIES DOZENS OF THEM IN WHITE NAVAL UNIFORM I THINK THEY WERE PROBABLY DUTCH I DON'T THINK THEY WAS OURS BUT MOVING AVOIDING THIS WRECKAGE AND AVOIDING THE BODIES AND YOU GOT TO THE STAGE NOW WE WERE IN THE WAR BODIES IN THE WATER MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT THEY WERE BODIES AND DEAD YOU KNOW ANYWAY WE SLOWLY MOVED IN WE ANCHORED IN THE DOCK THERE AND ONE BY ONE THE CRUISER DISGORGED HER TROOPS FIRST AND WE CAME IN NEXT SO THE THREE OF US ALL OUR TROOPS WENT ASHORE HAD BEEN ALREADY TAKEN OVER BY THE U K ARMY I HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN AHEAD IT WAS THE INDONESIAN REBELS THAT WERE FIGHTING THEY HAD ALREADY KILLED BRIGADIER MALLABY THAT WAS THE ARMY BOSS AND THESE TROOPS WENT ASHORE AND WE STAYED THERE READY FOR A LOT OF SURVIVORS OF THE DUTCH PEOPLE BE BROUGHT ACROSS FROM A CAMP RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF CUBA AND THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT UNDER AN ESCORT ANOTHER TRUCE BRIGADE MALAY HAD BEEN KILLED UNDER A TRUCE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DUTCH PEOPLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN MOSTLY IN A CAMP ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS BY ANOTHER TRUCE ARMY TRUCKS GUARDED BY INDIAN TROOPS THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS TO US AND WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THEM ON BOARD AND WE WERE TO TAKE THEM OUT TO THE TROOPERS WHICH COULDN'T GET INTO THE HARBOUR WELL WE WERE THEN TOLD WHILE WE WAITED FOR THESE PEOPLE TO COME ACROSS WE WERE TO GO INTO THE WATER BECAUSE WE MIGHT BE USED WHICH WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AS IT HAPPENED WHEN THIS CONVOY OF ARMY TRUCKS GUIDED BY INDIAN TROOPS GOT AS FAR AS SURABAYA THAT THEY WERE STOPPED ALTHOUGH THEY HAD A WHITE FLAG THEY WERE STOPPED BY THE POST OFFICE WHICH WAS FULL OF INDIAN INDONESIAN REBELS THE INDIAN REBELS SET UP TRENCH MORTARS AND MACHINE GUNS AND AS SOON AS THE CONVOY GOT THERE THEY SHOT THE TROOPS THAT WERE GUARDING THE CONVOY AND THE CONVOY COME TO THE HALT SO WE WERE CALLED IN TO USE OUR FOUR FOUR FIVE GUNS SO WE HAD TO FIRE ON THE TOWN AND WE TOOK OUT THE POST OFFICE INDONESIAN TROOPS IN IT AND THEN THE CONVOY COME THROUGH WE WENT BACK INTO HARBOUR AND WE HAD ALL THE DUTCH PEOPLE ON BOARD AND WE TOOK THEM OUT TO SEE WE WE DIDN'T PERSONALLY HAVE TO GO ASHORE I HAD TO GO ASHORE LATER ON TO GUARD SOME OF THE WAREHOUSES AND SO ON BUT WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO ANY FIGHTING THE ONLY FIGHTING WE HAD TO DO WAS FIRING A GUN BECAUSE I WAS ON THE UPPER DECK AT THE TIME WHEN WE WERE CALLED IN TO FIRE AND I WAS CALLED OFF THE UPPER DECK FIRE GUN AND I SAID I'M NOT GOING THEY SAID YOU'RE TODAY THEY PUT ME ON THE ON THE GUN GUNNERY WAS ANOTHER ONE AND WE HAD TO FIRE TO DO DIRECTIONS A SPOTTER PLANE THAT WAS SENT UP BY THE ARMY SET AND SPOTTER PLANE AND APPARENTLY WE TOOK OUT THE POST OFFICE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF DOING THE DAY WE DID HAVE THEM ON BOARD OVERNIGHT A LOT OF DUTCH PEOPLE WE LOCATED ALL THE FOREIGN MESS DECKS AND HAD TO SLEEP AFT ON THE UPPER DECK IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND THE DUTCH PEOPLE WOMEN IN THE FRONT THERE TIL WE TOOK THEM OUT TO THE OTHER SHIPS THAT AND THEN WE GOT OUR PLACE BACK I LOST A PAIR OF SAND OR AS THEY DISAPPEARED HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU'RE SAILING INTO A HARBOUR DECK AND YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF NAVAL PEOPLE WELL YOU'RE APPREYOU'RE APPREHENSIVE TO START WITH BUT THE RE YOU'RE VERY SELDOM FRIGHTENED I SUPPOSE YOU WERE IN A DRILL RULE COMES BACK LATER ON AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF WELL I COULD VE BEEN KILLED THERE YOU KNOW BUT I WASN'T AND THAT'S HOW YOU TOOK IT YOU COULDN'T YOU THOUGHT OF ALL THESE THINGS AT THE TIME YOU'D BE A NERVOUS WRECK BUT YOU'RE EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AND I WERE NINETEEN YEARS OLD AND ANYTHING HAPPENS AND FORTUNATELY YOU ACCEPT IT IT'S NOT FEAR SOMETIMES I THINK BACK NOW AND SAY WELL I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED HER BUT I'M NOT I'M HERE SO WE ACCEPT IT AS JUST A FACTOR OF LIFE IT WAS EXCITING IT'S QUITE A QUITE A BIG WAY TO END THE WAR TO END YOUR NAVAL SERVICE REALLY ISN'T IT TO BE INVOLVED IN CONTACT LIKE THAT IT'S NICE TO BE AT THIS STAGE AND KNOW THAT YOU'VE DONE CERTAIN JOBS WHERE INSTEAD OF WELL WE MUST HAVE KILLED PEOPLE BY THE THE POST OFFICE BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM AND YOU KNOW BY DOING THAT YOU HELPED TO SAVE HELPED TO SAVE THE LOSS OF PERHAPS EVEN UNTIL THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE HAD THE SAME FEELING ABOUT WHEN WE WERE ESCORTING THE TROOPERS THE FACT THAT WE NEVER KNEW WHETHER WE HAD SUNK A SUBMARINE A U BOAT BECAUSE WE NEVER STAYED LONG ENOUGH ALL WE COULD DO WAS DEPTH CHARGE A TARGET IF THAT TARGET WAS A U BOAT WE MIGHT HAVE SUNK IT OR IT MIGHT HAVE GOT AWAY BUT OUR JOB WAS TO LOOK AFTER A SHIP COMING IN WITH FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS AND AS LONG AS WE SAVED THAT I'M HAPPY BUT YOU NEVER KNOW I JUST HOPE WE DIDN'T I JUST HOPE THAT THERE WASN'T A U BOAT THERE AND THAT THOSE PEOPLE WEREN'T KILLED THEY WERE ONLY DOING THE SORT OF THING THAT WE WERE DOING AND THAT WAS A JOB
