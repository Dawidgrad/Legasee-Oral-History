what was your skipper like we had four or five skippers on board they lasted for about one or two years on board the first skipper was called simian and the other was called daniels they all became admirals after that then we had mcgregor and then a fella called brook brook took us out to the far east in nineteen forty three to the far east fleet did different skippers bring different attitudes different ideas to renown not really they seem to nowadays but we had a fully efficient working ships you couldn't really change any of that the ship was pretty good and gunnery good at getting the ship to sea and everything like that good at maintenance there wasn't much else that the captain could change and of course he was under instructions to where he went and what operations he took so no not to my knowledge that i can remember that the captains done a lot of alterations some of the officers might have been more aware of him must of watched him to see what he liked or didn't we still had to get the ship ready and get it out to sea whoever the captain was in charge they were all highly experienced men you couldn't become a captain of sa battlecruiser without sufficient experience a case of if its not broken down don't fix it that's right nothing really changed from one captain to another if it was a good ship and a lucky ship they were all very proud to captain a ship like that it was proved because every one of them were made admiral afterwards so they must have done a good job what was it like going down south to the indian ocean it was very different we went in through the med and down the suez canal then into colombo then round to the other side and we were based in trincomalee we went on a few trips there done a few bombardments we had an american carrier there and i think that was the wasp again that went with us so there was quite a big fleet there the fleet was starting to build up from australia mostly for the pacific war so we stayed around in trincomalee and crossed the indian ocean i think the japanese started to get put on the run a bit by then then the main fleet went down to sydney and we stayed in trincomalee and then in actual fact the renown went down to durban and had a re fit all of the fellas that had been on the ship for five years decided it were time for us to be sent home so we were all thrown off the ship so we didn't even get a chance to see durban the ship then came back from durban and so they decided there weren't enough heavy ships in the uk renown was called back to the uk incase the tirpitz came out the renown was recalled to the uk they changed another lot of the crew they picked up about five hundred people who spent most of their time in the war in the far east and brought them back home the renown came back and was based in scapa flow and then that took us into nineteen forty five and then she came down to rothside i think the german admirals came on board the peace deal and the signing over to the german navy was signed on board renown you weren't out there no i was left out there i ended up in colombo and came back on a troop ship what was it like for a young man like you to be based in a place like trincomalee it was a bit of a dump really we went ashore and we had to make our own football pitch area there was a canteen area there and we were rationed down to two bottles of beer each and that's all you got so apart from swimming over the side and a bit of sailing there wasn't much else to do really we had a good chaplin on board and every week we had chaplin hour and then get all the talent on board you know to have a bit of a concert we all slept on the upper deck we pulled our hammocks onto the upper deck because it was so hot you couldn't sleep down below we had no air conditioning you see it was very warm down below in those ships all the ships that go out now all have air conditioning we didn't even have cold water no refrigerator or anything like that pretty basic living really you couldn't use too much water when you were bathing because you needed all the water you got for steaming and that was the situation for all the ships in the war they didn't make enough water for human consumption if you like how long could you be at sea before you had to replenish it i suppose you could stay at sea for a couple of months we had big freezers and plenty of tinned food on board it all depended on how much steaming you done you know how much fuel and what speed you were doing of course if you were going at a fast speed you would use your oil fuel quicker and you would have to go into harbour and replenish i mean if we had destroyers with us we used to use the fuel from them but wasn't like now they have all these replenishments at sea royal fleet auxiliary ships we never fuelled at sea or anything we fuelled other ships so it all depends how much fuel you had which determined how long you could stay at sea
