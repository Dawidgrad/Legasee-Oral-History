with the guards patrolling around the top all the time and there were there were two incidents there first of all i managed to get into the carpenter's shop now the japs in charge of the railway repair workshop which we were there were six hundred of us two hundred british two hundred australian two hundred dutch mainly indonesian dutch and and i managed to get into the carpenter's shop the wood shop and the wood shop was controlled by civilian japanese in fact all the workshops this was a repair workshop they moved it because it was being bombed by or by the allies in the other place where it was and we had three three civilian japanese in in the workshop there was pop who was a wizened old jap and he never understood or never could speak english all he knew was pop was complimentary and he treated us well he used to buy bananas and things and that there was moon face who come from osaka a description of his face leaves nothing to be desired and there was sunny boy when he walked his feet were at ninety degrees i mean and that and they were civilian japs and they used to treat us well when we when we were working in the in the work in the sawmill so that was all right so it wasn't so bad can you remember what you know what how how you knew that the war was coming to an end ah the japanese comma lieutenant i think he was it i can't remember now had a radio now the radio had been fixed by japanese technical people and he could only get japanese but after a short time it started to go wrong and the call went out by the japs anybody new radio we had an australian who was i mean if you had a technical australian he was a good one but i say anything more about the australians but a call went out to see if anybody would could repair this radar this this chap went a volunteer to do it and he found that there was a been altered by the japs and a piece was missing and he put a call out amongst the british and the australians for certain bits of pieces bits of wire and things like that and he constructed the piece that was missing and went back fitted this piece in chewed it in chewed it into the allies radio whichever it was i think it was coming from india i'm not sure and cause turned it up and listened to it and then said to this jap office this okay oh no no no damning damming no good no good because it was speaking in english so of course with that he switched the radio down took this piece out that he'd made put it in his pocket or in his whatever he was wearing and fixed it back to japanese in such a way that about a week later or ten days later it broke down again he used to regularly break down once a week once a fortnight how he did it i just cannot tell you and of course he was called back used to do the same thing again get a bit more news and we knew that the war was coming to an end we knew the atomic bombs and of course the japs knew this and cause they were a bit frightened and what do you know about the atomic bomb through through this chap with the radio you see i mean it broken down and the the prettish radio for the forces in a in a india were broadcasting that they dropped the this atomic bomb and then that atomic bomb you know and so he was getting the information back having tuned the radio into british what's name then used to tug his little piece out chewed it back into japanese and a week or a fortnight later it broke down again and he was called back again to do it again so we were kept and we knew we knew the war was over and now i can't i've got a bit of a blank mare i can't exactly don't remember now all i all i can remember and you would never see it but to see a lancaster bomber or a liberator sorry they were liberators in in the far east liberate a bomber flying along and seeing white puffs come out of out of the plane i knew that would appreciate of thinking that it was engine back firing engine trouble but then to see these white puffs slowly disintegate and flutter and flutter down and knew that they were it was paper well i had a young boy in the workshop with me who lived close by a young tie boy and i said i i can remember saying to boon look that paper you you know you bring to me and so we knew when the allies were dropping these these papers they were destined for us they knew where the prison camps were and they were dropping these bundles of papers around prison camps hoping that we'd get them and so we knew when the war was over and the course of the attitude of the japs completely changed and i was moved back moved back to the the whole camp was moved back to a main base camp which was about four miles away and a i fatfortunately the captain and marines off the repose was was in that camp so of course i been the wrong marine i mean i got i got detailed to be with him and so we knew various things were going on and that can you remember what it was like when you saw that piece of paper did it when boon brought it back due to you oh yes and now what happened to that i can't remember now i can't remember now exactly what happened he very likely very likely went for a smoking because a being close to a civilization we could get a so called a japanese not japanese tie tie tobacco and some of the chaps just they would rather smoke than eat where as me i mean the er we were in paid when we were in the workshop we paid ten cents a day well a bunch of bananas would cost you two dollars from the outside you know ties bringing in and so well and we used to keep things going like that so you've been liberated what was it like returning to england after all that time and so and seen a family well we were flown we when we when we were told to we were taken down to ban cock and by again by the japanese because the japanese now under allied control we were taken down to bangkok and billeted in the er in the hanger hangs ageing is to i've not thought i lost when i first went out it was still there the hanger and and the following morning we were detailed of twenty men right your number one group twenty men your number two group twenty men number three group and at a certain time in the morning there were nothing in half an hour there were twenty and i i i it's funny talking to you i can remember these details and yet i can't remember other details and there were ten to twenty decodes lie landed and you were told right your number signs to get on that plane and we were flown back to rangoon rangoon to am i can't remember what it was now he was turned into a british hospital in the rangoon and then after a time we were detailed off a on to a a transport ship and it was a woostershire that the name of the ship was wastershere and there was about to twenty of us marines including the captain of marines and one of our lieutenants who had been gathered together we were and we were taken down to rangoon and put into this army place and we we learnt there was a row marine detachment who had come up come up the rangoon river and a were billeted in the in rangoon and as soon as we knew this we got with the number of marines that i can't tell you how many there was now we we come up command the lorry went down to a rangoon and we welcome into the romare mess and we lived with the raw marines they you know they'd never heard anything about us they were they would command is coming on and we lived with them for about a week until we were detailed off to the wooster shire to come home that must have been amazing to see you know fit young raw marines against yourself where in seven miles stands oh yes men they they absolutely adored us and now we were but now that was good that we had our own mistake on the on the wooster share came back to liverpool and we raw marines were taken down to down to plymouth given ration cards and money and that and given given two months leave go home and don't report back for so and so can you remember what it was like going up to your home knocking on the door ah yes i do actually a sepia got it and my father when i am when the war came he'd he'd been in the royal engineers in the fourteen eighteen war and had a bit of a rough time and warm me when i went home and told him i joined the wrong range he said good luck boy when i came home after being i prise war he'd got a a big big sheet or something and tied it across the end of the road welcome home i can always remember that but then things happened and i left that's your life's military life story yep well i i went back after old series hagger i went back to the raw marines and you do my war service or that i was destined for and what was a oh i was just in in those days a curse all romarines were trained as parachutes oi was told to report to the office one day you will be going to so and cover parachute training and i said in no way you will that is an order i said i won't and i had already learnt that as i joined up in nineteen forty there were no warts war service marines then of course after i joined they started recruiting war service marines and i learnt that i could transfer so i told the recruiting sergeant what i thought of him went into the office applied for transfer to war service went back to to him and threw through me application on his desk he said the are now you know what you can do and i came out i nearly went back but a commando work was not my oh i was not fit in a net to do commander work so having gone back to my old company no i didn't i thought as a as a as tall in that as i am once i got fairly fit i i wanted to be a policeman so i joined the city of london police that was a body sight worse than the romans ever was so after a year he dove a directing traffic and that at the bank of england in in those days there were seven policemen at the bank of england in london you very likely know the the crossroads there there's traffic lights there now there used to be one in the middle and he was ever direct the other other policemen around him to stopping and starting traffic on the different roads to after a year i thought it was a damn sight worse than the romaine so i packed it in and went back into industry do you have any you know overriding what would be your overriding sort of reflection on your world war to experience a just one of those things i showed my country a to the best of my ability i survived as a prison of war which is a let me to look at life somewhat differently and how can i just carry on i survived
