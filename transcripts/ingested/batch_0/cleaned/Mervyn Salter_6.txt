forty four presented some differently challenges where you at normandy yes yes indeed after being repaired at newcastle we did another russian convoy and then we were detailed to normandy for d day we joined in the bombardment the dawn bombardment which again something that is hard describe the noise and the effect all the ships firing their guns it really was something you know we remained there for about two months patrolling juno sword beaches in the channel again protecting the landing craft and the building mulberry harbour one or two minor incidents and this took us up until september i think it was what were the minor incidents can you remember couple of german vessels were entering the channel going to jersey and we exchanged shots with them but they got away we might well of hit one or two but as i say nothing really serious did you go out to ouistreham as well yes yes indeed did you think there was did you see feel that there was a different experience to normandy does it scale or well arromanchewas a the beach a fantastic beach it really was it was different a holiday type of effect you know ok so in september then is that when you were then moved to the pacific no we then went back and did another two russian convoys and this then took us up to the end of nineteen forty four anything exciting on those convoys one of them there was a lot of air activity i forget which one one of them was a very fast patrol we escorted a ship it was taking whether it was prisoners of war i'm too sure about that but anyway it was a fast run for us did you have any feeling about the fact that you'd seen normandy and then you had to do more russian convoys does it did you sap your moral or did you just accept it again it was all part of your duties you just had to get on with it cause' as i say the end of nineteen forty four the next thing was that we were appointed captain d of the this was in january nineteen forty five appointed captain d of the twenty sixth destroyer flotilla and what did that mean to you and what did that mean to the ship in general well we had a captain on board who was intent on becoming an admiral and did and did become an admiral later on and as captain d of these ships the venus virago vigilant volage so that we we were sort of in charge we set an example i suppose and with the captain aboard he was making sure that this was so doing exercises all of the time to make sure that we were efficient as i say did you enjoy it was it enjoyable having somebody that sort of getting you active and up and about i wouldn't say enjoy but we it's certainly you know put on your metal and you know this was not a bad thing that we sailed through the mediterranean we oiled at malta alexandria through the suez canal stopping at port aden and then finally birthed at trincomalee which had become our main base for attacking the japanese
