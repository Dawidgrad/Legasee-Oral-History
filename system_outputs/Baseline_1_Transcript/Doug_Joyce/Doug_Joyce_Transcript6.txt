you touched on there just on chatter just tell me a bit about chattom what was it like there for you chatham well is it was all right there i mean we use to come out to chat and barracks and go into town got the silliman or something we're goin have a drink somewhere you know it or so it's just like in any naval dockyard are you know because a because that long road that leads down to the barracks cause the barracks not being used now is it and we used to you now go down there and sometimes if we walked it you had to walk on the pavement cause i got vehicles nipping up and down there were off moving like a knock your flying i would but sir but we've got the bus that we always got the bus down if we could get it were you ever there for an air rage no no never been there for an air water what was the feeling like when you'd sail out of chatter and be going off on another operation did it was there any sense on board of how it felt in fact you know we we used to get fed up sitting still in in either chatham or scary flows glad only to please to get out and see something you know to cause we could we could oil destroyers from our ship cause we carried ali three thousand tons of oil aboard us how we could all a destroyer or smaller boat save that bringing out the royal fleet auxiliary and that's the no there was two of em but a week we could that we could accommodate that hardly am that but that was a risky job or no a line yes as they were member in tell me about about a press will now used to watch him right and as the the crane would old pipe line going across up on a sort of loose tackle it so as as the sea went up and down it had that much free play in it i didn't pull the pipe away from the destroyer from us lot and when the captain done the rounds cause the the domestic to be really tidy when the captain on rounds is a commander come round he wants to be the captain one's got spick and span spot on no did you ever speak to him no no don't speak the captain do unless he's talked to you as he talks to you about that i did he ever speak to you and went along up on the bridge light it is in our summit light where you're from and all that that's so but to say the best bloke aboard in was the the lieutenant commander newsom and his wife played the accordion and things like that to entertain the troops as well she came aboard once and introduced me to a lock in there is another block a ball day in his own in the officer's galley and i put him for writing duties in the commander's office i thought that through my keep me out of watches you have been very crafty you know and a case where the door is of the commander's office where the turret goes round you sort of fit in a little half moon world don't spouse you 's big as all this and we back taylor was the number one writer they at and case old ted he was in the galley and he used to say ok and i cook some cakes and hand them to me and one each for me on butler you of course what they were doing then when they store ship that was the time the blokes i as it comes the light to come alongside with all the wines and spirits for the officers cause we weren't allowed any any boos and at all and they be handed handle em down and go down the shot into the store room for the officers there was some one one blows a catch in course one day a bloc caught a big bottle of scotch you know where he hid it under the commander's bed of course i couldn't balance i won't know whether the spot the scotch is there searching everywhere it's underneath the commander's bed it was that he is rogues then it just the same but ted did in the end no when i he's living in hogan village by set to me this hair fixed is it's all right lie but she said you got to get yourself a stable job light i said so why not trying to post of can't see ted cause he was working round the corner for me is aboard my ship and i went round in the night i said there's ted jenkins see light so no and you heard i said what he sees he got killed in a crash last night what happened you that he was a very good mechanic rather than take his van into the carriage and leave it there he done it himself went down north road or hill out into the bottom road like where you could get a jewel carriageway and the rose roy's coming other way was on the off side of the bloody road and it's a mid on he went through all that to come over here to get slated like that don't seem possible to that what with the atlantic convoys do you do well the trouble is there no air cover was there i want once you get certainly that the you boats had their picking it wasn't until i had these a light lit not lysander home shackleton it as a long distance plainer and then they could then bomb the u boats with all the waiting in the middle of the atlantic you now to get their pickings though but once once we had the aircraft that can make it there and back again with their own fuel that put the kibosh on that so did you ever had to give us any would you be a yes i saw i've wine when i've been doing look out i've seen the periscope following us it was very nice to shut out a periscope on the starboard side sir and the officer watch were looking at an so we can't see him and said will be kept were i in him he was he was falling where he's just tapping out information i danilo better so bit because he was moving and he was he'd have to be on the surface to do to tell pete me how did it work i know what we done we we catapoid bombs not out you know the show that step charge out to him that and they sort of scattered all that did didn't come anywhere near us you know was that in the arctic or the atlantic that was in the atlantic i must have been quite unnerving to see a lemon telescope dish so have prayers and hope for the best what were you so what were you doing out in the atlantic was the job we we used to go out and escort the ships like us perhaps the the yanks will come so far with them then we will take over from the yanks so they can go back to their port and we can then bring them back into where were they going liverpool docker southampton wherever they were going not your but where were the bigger convoys you know what was the biggest convoy you ever did remember ah well that that pace seventeen was thirty four ships merchant ships and when you reckon only eleven reach port out of that lot it's a terrific loss said willie is you know is a very bad loss cause even churchill said that he said was a very bad loss that convoy
