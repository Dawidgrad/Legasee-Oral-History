well you start doing the atlantic convoys you are quite a good guest on board we had quite a good guest you have winston oh instil oh yeah we well we'd done a special trip for him and we we went all the way over to canada and we went over to halifax to pick him up he'd been at the cube conference quebec conference with with president roseville and he only wanted us to bring him back so so we steamed over there we went through a big gale on the way over a mighty gale and we got over there and he got got in to halifax and they all knew what we were there for we weren't we weren't supposed to tell anybody they all knew that we'd gone to collect winston and then went and then he came on board with his his wife and his daughter mary and he walked along the jetty and came on board and and then we we we set sail from halifax and a full full speed across the atlantic and zigzagged all the way and we didn't have any destroyer escort they couldn't keep up with us in the weather bad weather you know we were doing nearly twenty eight twenty nine knots i think you know and so we brought him safely back to greek but we nearly lost his daughter on the way because i mary churchill she was the one of the school master officers took us for a walk along the quarterdeck and the quarterdeck was out of bounds cause we're very low down aft part of the ship and when the ship was at sea and we were zigzagging there's a mighty lot of water used to wash over the quarterdeck and this guy took her for a walk and the next thing the big wave came and picked the two of them up and and and washed them along the deck and she managed to grab hold of a wire and one of the young officers went down and managed to grab hold of her and pull her back but she thought she'd goon and but if she'd gone over the side we wouldn't a stopped to pick her up we wouldn't have been you know we were too dangerous to pick her up and winston didn't know anything about this so he didn't know until afterwards i think really he that evening she arrived for dinner wearing her savy clothes and and her her hair was still wet and the and he said i don't now i don't remember giving permission for for you to work cause she was in army uniform i i i didn't give i don't remember giving you permission to wear civilian clothes for dinner and he didn't know what had happened she celebrated her twenty first birthday on board the ship actually in nineteen forty three as she had been born in nineteen twenty two was very special there was actually the i remember it they had a they they baked though a cake and the end and presented her with her a cake and a car and i think one and one of the ship's kittens he gave her a kitten when the ship's cat had had kittens on board so they gave her a kitten as a present i think you know and yes she had her twenty twenty first birthday were there any other women on board the renan course her mother was on board i think there was a might have been a couple of types or things like that but they had been all in in the up in the officers court they were the only women we ever carried on board actually i suppose mary's trace we will hold the record she's the only woman ever to fire a gun on the renown i think you know because they took her all round and put her on a machine gun on a one on all licking her a bope and she had a bang away at each of them i don't think any other woman in history except here that has fired a gun on nature must re known it is that she remembers all those things about the ship you know that i was it was it was considered bad luck to have a woman on board ship i never heard it it it has been spoken of but but only was it did it did it did it give a pride to the the crew of the renown to know that you'd been selected to carry winces oh yes yes yes they do and especially we got some leaf when he gave us some leaf when we got back to greek oh yes we are very proud to carry winston oh yes he was number one guy we carried him anywhere and when we picked is the second trip we picked him up here in plymouth and and took him in the night time nobody knew he was coming on board you know em we picked him up when he was going to alexander that time and next time we were down in the bay of biscuit on our way down at thirty knots for winson on board so so he liked us he came with us twice did he do you speak to yourself not to me no no i spoke i think he might have said get out of my way or something like that that's about all he might have said no and what was in my haring him on board did you change the armature ship when it is it did it did really and i was quite close to them really because i was doing electrical work at that time and none of us had to be near their quarters in case in a bowl blue or a fuse blue or something like that to do you know any electric repairs and now and again winston had come out and he'd walk along and though he might want to see a film or something no he'd go and see the film might be there five minutes he walked back again you know he he'd he'd be in and out and then we had a big war room with all these maps on we had put heaps and heaps of lights drunk as he had his his staff with him in a and you could see all all the russian front and the north african front and the italian and they had all these maps and they all he'd be kept up to date he was in and out there all the time and matter of fact i had to go in and a lady churchill had an electric iron as she got in america and he wouldn't work in she i had to go and repair her iron so she could do a bit of iron in so i had a little chat with her it's a she lovely lady it and then we took him after that we we we we weren't long back from there september i think november then we took him out in the mediterranean cause there was another conference either with turan or somewhere we took him out to i took him out to gibraltar and then algiers and then malta and then on on on to him alexander then he flew home from there so we took him on two trips he took his other daughter the second time sarah i think she was in the air force but the you know they went along as he's eighty combatants but
