did you as boy sailors have a sense that you know there was a real potential for a war you know during that training period did you expect to see war we did actually because it was in nineteen thirty eight when he never chamberlain came back from munich with a piece of paper said you know that there wouldn't be any war so the next thing we were all out in the program with the pickaxes and shovels and we were digging air rage shelters on our parade ground which we enjoyed real because we enjoy that more than we did marching on it is that a sort of you know but you reach the end of a period where before you go on a ship i mean is there a sort of a a you now well done or is it all part of the next thing is you'll go to a ship i suppose it was a continuation because i mean the training ship was am s anyway so it it was like a a shore based ship if you like and the the routine was much the same so we got on the ship probably found it a bit easier and we got on a ship as a routine and it wasn't a strict really yes oh dear we we find life on a ship we got a bit more a bit more freedom if you like although as boys we still had you know to conform to boys routine and we had a boy's mesic and everything and the boys were kept away from them from the the older sailors you know we weren't allowed to mix with them only for worked work purposes and what was it like seeing the reno can you remember the first time you saw her senseen the reno we thought it was a mighty big thing when we saw it in in that it was in the dockyard in portsmouth you know cause we had been around the the the naval dockyard in portsmouth before that so we we had seen a lot of big ships you know he was a lot of big ships coming in and out there were a lot of battleships around and we had seen the hood which was the sister ship to renown really so which was a bigger vessel so well we had seen bigger ships you know but we'd never we'd never actually serve had been on on until we got on there and sadly finding our way around okay that's it's a good point to ask about just tell me a bit about you're the boy's mass what it was like who you are worth just a configuration for somebody who's never seen a mess that before there was usually about twenty on each mess and you had a scrub table which you scrubbed it every morning after breakfast and you went up to the galley you took turns two of you at a time to be cook of the mess and you went up to the galley and he was on on a big ship like renown it was what they called general messing so all the food was provided for you you your breakfast as you cook breakfast or beans on toast or bacon and tomatoes that sort of thing and and then at dinner time twelve o'clock you went up and got your dinner usually you know roast or or boiled dinner whatever it was and then you you had sort of bread and butter for tea and in the evening then you had you had supper was could be now may be sauces in chips or that sort of thing and and then it was time for boys to turn in at nine we are to turn in by nine o'clock but then they call the hands in the morning at after six or seven a clock we were all out because we we all slept in hammocks you you had to learn to sling your hammock and sling it properly because you were on a ship that was moving you know if you didn't sling it probably could fall out of it so i spent all all my time in the navy sleeping in a hammock really i did i was only on one ship where they had bunks so i got so used to a hammock i got to like it i rather a hammock than a bed i think even that ye yes it's very comfortable when you specially when you get adjusted to your own you know to your own needs as it were and what were they the boys that you were that you went on to renown with were they all pumpyratings no they were all done bigger because before the war there there was a davenport manship sportsmen man ships and chatter man ships so your your official number was either d j x for davenport or p j x for portsmouth or see jax for chatham so we all the boys went on to renown and they were from different classes not nasty from all for my class and we we happened to be graded to devenport so when we went on board renown the crew came up here from de devon from the barracks in devonport came up by train and joined the ship the same time as we did in portsmouth and and then it remained like that until after the war then ship the depots became amalgamated as it were so i renowned as a devenport man shipped all during the war although we never saw devenport very often we only came in here once in five six years i think
