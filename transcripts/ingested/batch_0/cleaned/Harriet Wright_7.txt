and what where did you go after hatston well the war finished and we came down lock stock and barrel from hatston to halesworth because they closed hatston then and um halesworth had been an raf station so um we had to mess with the men i don't mean i mean mess with the men have your meals and things with the men and the wrens were very lucky really because we always had teapots big teapots the old enamel ones but always in there teapot whereas when we got down there i suppose they'd left a lot of the stuff there and they had um so you never know whether you were having tea coffee or coco it all tasted the same instead of keeping one for tea only and one for coffee only and so forth oh no didn't like that at all do you remember ve day um yes i do i do indeed but um there wasn't that much i think london was probably the place to be on ve day really because we still would have been um on duty because being in communications i wore the cross flags on my sleeve rather than the w or whatever and um i think um you were always on duty watch keeping so you had mornings and you had afternoons you had evening shifts and night shifts and um i i preferred that actually than a nine to five job made the return of their convoy to lioness after their oh well no i was on loan to lioness for three works somebody or two weeks or three weeks i can't remember but um somebody was off sick so i had to go to lioness to cover and during that time the nabob came in right and um i could there the the switch ops and things were underground a bit not on the top slightly underground and i remember my tea break went up to ground level and you could watch the soldi sailers come off the ship and they were all looking about sixteen eighteen very young looking you know and drunk as lords really they were but you can't blame them can you because there they were they could have been at the bottom of the ocean by then you know and especially to limp back to lioness you know well the funny thing is years after when my um married alfred it wasn't until two years or so after i married him and i was talking about we were talking about the wrns or the orkney's or something and i said something about the nabob and he said what did you say the nabob i said yeah and his brother in law was on that ship so i must have seen him come off that day too and all these years later must be sixty years later or so we find this out isn't it a small world how do you reflect on the war now that the the war itself and your work in the war um well i'm glad i joined up i must admit i think um i had a better time in the services than i would have had if i'd just been working and whatever um in wartime well i think um my first no wouldn't be my first job my second job after was i worked at staines kitchen equipment in street and there was a woman there she was older than i and she had a son peter who was in the i think he was the army and he was in germany she never had a good word to say for instance about germans ever you know well would you believe peter was stationed there for a while and he married a german girl so she had to eat her words didn't she but i made good friends i have no qualms about there's good and bad in everybody in every race and nation so but i can't what i can't understand nowadays is this conflict going on um in syria for instance how can people kill their own i just don't understand it well i i can see the point because as i say in when we were in diplomatic services one of our first postings was to um lagos in nigeria well again there are loads of tribes there reminded me a little bit of the scottish clans frankly you know and then of course they we had left just before the and the you know the east and the west because of the oil again um well a tribe is ok but i can't see this in syria i really can't and i can't see why scotland wants to separate either alex hammond wants his head sorted and what about the wrens how do you feel about that being a wren proud of it proud of it very proud of it now i um when i was had the globe laurel i bought another hat when i was transferred back to the fleet air arm of course i had to wear the hms so i kept my marine hat and every time i went on leave i would swap it over because nobody knew what i was then you see i was so proud of my marine hat how did you get that well because i was marine the home based office in ilfracombe but really i suppose the pay office and that sort of thing that's why everything had to go through there when people were injured died and so forth um yeah so um i do know i used to notice people looking at me you see wandering what i was and i liked that
