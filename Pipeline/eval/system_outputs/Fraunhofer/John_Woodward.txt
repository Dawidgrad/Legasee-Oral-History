colorblind so i was automatically transferred to the study branch which i didn't want but she had no choice you did what you were told and i got transferred to mine sweepers on i was based on the irish shabbier queensborough queensland queenborough pier um we has about ten miles feeble there and we went out every couple of days to sweep any lines that have been dropped by the boats in the hope of sinking our supplies ships can i have why did you join the navy well i wanted to get in a fight i didn't want to be left behind at the time i was what they call in the reserved occupation i was an apprentice as new electrical engineer and my dad didn't morbid soup and to join our papers in the last war unable to prefer me to learn a good steady trade but i wanted to go so as soon as i was a chain i went away from maidstone where a home was i came over to chatham to pembroke barris and signed up i said i was nineteen but uh aged mother because uh they just accepted you have you got a breathing out nuclear arms your physically fit i was told to go home and wait and i'd be contacted about a week later the although came reports had shattered barracks are sources saturday i went right through the war without actually saved the german where has long range fights remembering the rashly sorry and the jump what why didn't you know you wanted to do your bed but why did you not join the army or the our air i'm not interested in either that saved additional family and my father was in the navy so as my grandfather and uncle my grandfather was on beatty's flagship the line at the battle of gentlemen and they didn't come on deck for three days he was in the engineering branch but that's the service i wanted to join me so i did i want you remember of your training a rather is rather confused when you're younger you don't um two seasons are easily but from the pembroke house pembroke barracks we were all marched down to the further down the would be got fitted out at that time everyone a lesser were also was the same for love ready with bell bottoms the scarf and they and their the hat close up to skegness where another bunch to let his holiday camp and that became a tremendous royal lava and i was the stout and trade telegraphist seattle and i've been doing morse code just started on the morse code for about a fortnight then somebody's at all this the slot haven't as a acknowledges that was a habit most of them pass but to others and me we're all a strongly colorblind so you're out if you send the wrong colours when your signaling it could be a disaster so less for i was transferred on the maize fevers on the stewardess branch will you disappointed yes nobody light below miles favors will care for you for transfer to sammy more glamorous destroyers submarines m t b z m g bays i only got turned down your dirty porn job but you will stay put and that was it how many people one of these minesweepers how what was that about like five officers on about twelve fifteen crew that includes the engineers on the soccer branch of the corridor see lily on and those during the actual mind detecting when we first started and went out minesweeping it was three days on one day off and we had to siemens standing in the bows with rifles when they saw a minor was floating by that shoot at the hit the holes and blow it up but that was when they started the mine swearing campaign and they german is when the dragoon has a long waits on while some religious floated below the surface to hit the ship the wanderers wise came loose the main would bother service and that's a wonder these we look for each time we went out when the germans occupied france and of course got right on the coast line and there had big guns are the captain to relay i used to pop away thus every time we came out but unfortunately we'll never got hit there was one amuse ali dirt commodore had been um a sea captain before the war leave a retired to coarsely was brought back in a me commodore of the minesweeping fleet at least twelve lines weavers and why you surrounded the same these every day germans being by the meticulous we'll come out were say for ideas and chooses not only the same labor at the same time to lay their minds and then dashed back in and we were now the following morning each time to pick him up and the skipper gone a bit fed up with us on it's all the comforts of his captain as one day there's a next time below three being run your trolls out but don't drop earlier was which is across country all naval instructions equal regard court martial given the advent but we went through the german minefield her as they had laid it on the go away with it so the germans came out again to replace the mines they saw we picked up and the last fall of her own boats on their own nines and i don't think i sold that was very sporting is that document it two commended somewhere in the admiralty archives ear daisy did i did he could wriggle into a great deal of trouble for that the what was your row what were you doing when we went out i was and dude you're always there six others yours we reported to the first lieutenant where damage control party in a ship got hit we're declared the damage away put out the fires and pull the wounded into the war room where the doctor was waiting to do what he could but unfortunately it never happened but that was my official station and what about bad weather and i storms and stuff the ever encounter any dangers when you had bought any storms bad where the big seas oh we had some yes but there were still went out you just for all your cell where stones and that was it we're safety lies rig for outside the you hold onto though you wouldn't get washed overboard what about what did you was it was it what was it like watching the planes taking going over you and stuff did you see much activity in the air we went forty we're never gonna attack from the air i don't think you a gem was sold out little moshe we're wasting a bomb on they wanted him for the capital cities all their files were you involved in d day or two yes now a week before these eh the base was shut down like an oyster now you could go off do you really know all was allowed in as security reasons obviously you couldn't get the post you couldn't make any phone calls because it was coming other although officially we didn't know that on for about three months before die they on laboratories truck his red started night sweeping as an old surrendered to the day shift so the germans were get used to the idea of us poppy along the coast during the hours are doubtless they would so the early morning d day we went out at midnight and we were sweeping right up to the line where the battleships were waiting to bombard the coast where you exactly where they were going to be stationed we sweat that most carefully and then we as we started coming about the doubtless from two o'clock in the morning and waiting and we retired behind them there was nothing else for us to do we got sent back here too the chevy when the troops went ashore we're a bit annoyed because you weren't doing anything and there now about eight or nine days later as giving the orders too but trouble the dutch coast on the shouts and pick up all the mines which the germans had so liberally round over the coast there so that kept his busy for about three weeks and we were a station of the little town could tell news and a very small port but there was a an along jetty so we can morrow sigh there and his evenings late afternoon you've got shore leave until you are going up again next morning and i'll never had gotten the things we saw we went ashore the gym is a got out in a hurry there are signs were everywhere allah how shell lounge that will be an officer's mess and the signs were so up and they blew some of the bridges over the canals for as they wished on the dutch flooded some other dice to stop their heavy traffic getting away a lion member once we went ashore we all carry their navy raiko draped over your arm folded in a certain way on the obstinate watching you very well we are seizing the pockets cigarettes package of biscuits until her jam or whatever which was not supposed to be taken of the ship um we will give it to the doubt surgeons because they were a starved as hell and look very ill and on this occasion we got ashore and i saw a a very thin how you look in war when coming up the street pushing her about a pram and she got two little kids in there about three or a bit less as berries and the barn blanky covers of them and i don't mads good day and she gave me a small she couldn't speak english and one quarter speed dutch broad took out but i had a lot a prime you should see the look on her face she muscle saw him as christmas come twice president won't they didn't eight the girl was trade for somebody else there are gone back where law but um it wasn't to be after we got rid of most of the mines of the dutch coast we have a week leaved you we're all shall be well coming back here for it it would be on the dutch coast and i've little fellow we go on to the the main road which was the brussels road lady into into a belgium and thumb lips from the army laws which are always going up and down and we got into about three three hours a bit less into bruges would you will never was one of the most beautiful says that i've seen he's got to proceed rules an opera house and the town hall round the poor sides of the main square on one of the hotels have been taken over the nappy because our troops bed breakfast so we stayed there and now we enjoyed ourselves and when we came back we got older back to this the country and we are still were looking for a maize rich might have escaped detection going up and down but there wasn't a much urgency and any more on i did put in application to sit for leading steward but before that they could take place my discharge papers came through and that was in the early early nineties forty the nineteen forty six nineteen forty six years after the war near but unlike the army or their pause we got plenty of notice when it was coming other people wear and there boss and let me give you three days notice though they were out by the navy we had time were you told me you gotta be demobbed in three months well i guess your time to start looking round for a civilian job or somewhere to live if you're married with kids so i think we have a better deal can you explain you you talk about this mine sweeping just explain what you were doing honey what happens to these minds he would look like a yards it from the main maas stretched out either side about fifty feet and from these are depend a very sharp cutty was where waits on the end and as you go to the water the idea is to your katie wise to catch the maori wise for a mine and we cut it the main comes to the service and even dispose of it how many minds would you find on her on an average day on every day possibly a dozen possibly only too a varied and the disposal would be a shot with a or yes then the germans arranges the acoustic mind which i'm was a lonely resist dropped in the channel hopefully in the path of alchemy ships andy is emitted a magnetic field for me batteries that were inside and every ship as he goes also makes the magnetic field and when the to collide the money goes up so we are to have a was called de gauzy equipment a special coil fitted right round the ship of a coward is passed through that anti clockwise and that nullifies the effect of the electronics field and you go over mines and you'll be all right could you find those minds we found him yes sometimes the germans got crabs and they drop some of these lives at night from low flying planes and we got back i wasn't there was there only couple days leave and i went home to maidstone but i was told as far as squadron came back from patrol and the last ship in slid into its place on the jetty and probably blew up because there was a line under the pin drop by a plane and the skipper of this last bowed as a result every six free from the jetty he got his de gauzy quivers switched off i think there was to survive as but they were there now but how would you find i can understand how you could find a mind that was floating in the water you cut it and it flows in so how did you find these magnetic minds were they on the bottom or they're on on the bottom yes how would you find that whoa is love like a sonar device it picks up the radiation from the mine and you say exactly where it is they can drop a depth charge on it you set the depth charge for twenty three or thirty whatever it is i'm just some port the movers aside on the wagon in holland when you got to holland you talked a little bit about what you saw are there any other memories of just the devastation when the germans got out now you they took everyone with him alive or dead i'm blew a couple of bridges and then retreated towards belgium did you feel like you were winning the war that stage yes the great day i come the invasion had started and we were pushing your land from the beijing rain been shoved back off again and they were starting to it to debate when you were pulled out of data did you why you were you able to hear what was going on d day after the battleships of arrive you've come back to base did you will you around long enough to hear the but the guns going off they they uh when the main a broadside saudis years as he goes on quarter to six on eight miles of ships or opened up at the same time we already got information for their underground resistance workers where the germans strong points were all along the cliff tops heavy gun emplacements bunkers for troops and so on and they got continuous plants tree and they hadn't quite finished it was a two hour bombardment and a half an alford stopped the boats were going ashore with the troops did you hear it but we were on the man behind them we heard his right it was such a deafening crescendo of noise learn nothing like it they weren't even near it no and to share what do you remember v e day oh that was again marvelous i was a way she did mob and because he got rather more leave one's peace was declared and i'd got and while video the fourth day pass to go home to maidstone and we came up on me the trains are victoria on the bridge was just one see the mass of people every color every year of all maybe so you could see your and we're we're seeing dulcie laughing we're complete strangers down and in front of buckingham palace you could a got a shoe on in hundreds of thousands stretching back down the more waiting for the cue queen and winston to come on the balcony and the roar that went out mustard go rather bad ten fifteen minutes nonstop and he reflects on your navy service now i'm i'm glad i went means i and thousands of others don't have to rise about history we were making it we'll part of that history and as you get some one to be proud of are there any other stories you want to share i don't have any now say mai's favorite as a very dull occupation where the occasional short periods of activity but uh i'll light destroys or battleships you you're not in engaged permanent wave with where the opposite number were there any occasions where you were engaged no we will never attacked by plays and i said on we didn't see me german troops the only contact we have was when their long range guns on the french coast tried to get us while we were minors ruby but they didn't
