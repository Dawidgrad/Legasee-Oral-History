MY NAME IS JOHN DOUGLAS WOOD WOOD I'M EIGHTY NINE YEARS OLD I WAS BORN ON THE SEVENTH OF APRIL NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR WHEN IN THE SERVICE I HAD ORIGINALLY JOINED TO BE A SIGNALLER AND THEY FOUND OUT I WAS COLOUR BLIND SO I WAS AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE STEWARDING BRANCH WHICH I DIDN'T WANT BUT YOU HAD NO CHOICE YOU DID WHAT YOU WERE TOLD AND I GOT TRANSFERRED TO MINE SWEEPERS AND I WAS BASED THE ISLE OF THE SHIP HERE AT QUEENSBORO QUEENSLAND QUEEN BOROUGH PEER AND WE HAD ABOUT TEN MINS WE WAS THERE AND WE WENT OUT EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS TO SWEEP ANY MINES THAT HAD BEEN DROPPED BY THE BOATS IN THE HOPE OF SINKING OUR SUPPLY SHIPS CAN WHY DID YOU JOIN THE NAVY BECAUSE I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE FIGHT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND AT THE TIME I WAS WHAT ARE THEY CALLING A RESERVED OCCUPATION I WAS AN APPRENTICE AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER AND MY DAD DIDN'T WANT ME TO ERM TO JOIN UP HE WAS IN THE LAST WAR AND HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED ME TO LEARN A GOOD STEADY TRADE BUT I WANTED TO GO SO AS SOON AS I WAS EIGHTEEN I WENT OVER FROM MAJOR STONE WHERE OUR HOME WAS I CAME OVER TO CHATHAM TO PEMBROKE BARRACKS AND SIGNED UP I SAID I WAS NINETEEN BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE THEY JUST ACCEPTED YOU IF YOU COULD BREATHE OUT AND MOVE YOUR ARMS YOU WERE PHYSICALLY FIT I WAS TOLD TO GO HOME AND WAIT AND I'D BE CONTACTED ABOUT A WEEK LATER THE ENVELOPE CAME REPORTS OF CHATHAM BARRACKS ON SUCH AND SUCH A DAY I WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE WAR WITHOUT ACTUALLY SEEING A GERMAN WE HAD A LONG RAGE FIGHTS WITH THEM BUT I NEVER ACTUALLY SAW A GERMAN BUT JOHN WHY DIDN'T YOU KNOW YOU WANTED TO DO YOUR BIT BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU NOT JOIN THE ARMY OR THE RAF I WAS NOT INTERESTED IN EITHER IT'S A TRADITIONAL FAMILY MY FATHER WAS IN THE NAVY SO WAS MY GRANDFATHER AND AN UNCLE MY GRANDFATHER WAS ON THIS FLAGSHIP THE LION AT THE BATTLE OF JAPAN AND HE DIDN'T COME ON DECK FOR THREE DAYS HE WAS IN THE ENGINEERING BRANCH BUT THAT'S THE SERVICE I WANTED TO JOIN SO I DID AND WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF YOUR TRAINING IT'S RATHER CONFUSED WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND YOU DON'T TAKE THINGS IN SO EASILY BUT FROM PEMBROKE HOUSE PEMBROKE BARRACKS WE WERE ALL MARCHED DOWN TO THE FURTHER DOWN THE YARD WHERE WE GOT FITTED OUT AND AT THAT TIME EVERYONE LESS OF AN OFFICER WERE THE SAME FOUR AND A HALF RIG WITH BELL BOTTOMS THE SCARF AND THE HE HAD SENT UP TO SKEGNESS WITH ANOTHER BUNCH TO BUTLINS HOLIDAY CAMP AND THAT BECAME HMS ROYAL ARTHUR AND I WAS TO START TRAINING AS A TELEGRAPHS SIGNALLER AND I'VE BEEN DOING MORSE CODE YOU STARTED ON THE MORSE CODE FOR ABOUT A FORTNIGHT THEN SOMEBODY SAID OH THIS LOT HAVEN'T HAD A COLITIS THEY'D BETTER HAVE IT MOST OF THEM PASSED BUT TWO OTHERS AND ME WERE ALL STRONGLY COLOUR BLIND SO YOU'RE OUT IF YOU SEND THE WRONG COLOURS WHEN YOU'RE SIGNALLING IT COULD BE A DISASTER SO THAT'S WHEN I WAS TRANSFERRED ONTO MINE SWEEPERS ON THE STEWARDING BRANCH WERE YOU DISAPPOINTED YES NOBODY LIKED BEING ON MINESWEEPERS WE ALL KEPT PUTTING IN FOR TRANSFER TO SOMETHING MORE GLAMOROUS DESTROYERS SUBMARINES M T B M G B BUT ALWAYS GOT TURNED DOWN YOU'RE DOING AN IMPORTANT JOB YOU WILL STAY PUT AND THAT WAS IT HOW MANY PEOPLE ON ONE OF THESE MINE SWEEPERS WHAT WAS THE THE BOAT LIKE ER FIVE OFFICERS AND ABOUT TWELVE FIFTEEN CREW THAT INCLUDES THE ENGINEERS OR THE STOKER BRANCH THEY CALLED IT SIGNALLING AND AND THOSE DOING THE ACTUAL MIND DETECTING WHEN WE FIRST STARTED WENT OUT MINE SWEEPING IT WAS THREE DAYS ON ONE DAY OFF AND WE HAD TWO A MAN STANDING IN THE BOWS WITH RIFLES WHEN THEY SAW A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING BY THEY'D SHOOT AT IT HIT THE HORNS AND BLOW IT UP BUT THAT WAS WHEN THEY STARTED THE MINE SWEEPING CAMPAIGN AND THE GERMANS WHEN THEY DROPPED THEM HAD LONG WEIGHTS ON WIRES SO THEY JUST FLOATED BELOW THE SURFACE TO HIT THE SHIP IF ONE OF THOSE WIRES CAME LOOSE THE MINE WOULD BOB ON THE SURFACE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOKED FOR EACH TIME WE WENT OUT WHEN THE GERMANS OCCUPIED FRANCE THE COURSE GOT RIGHT ON THE COAST LINE AND THEY HAD BIG GUNS CAPTAIN GREENER AND HE USED TO POP AWAY AT US EVERY TIME WE CAME OUT BUT FORTUNATELY WE NEVER GOT HIT THERE WAS ONE AMUSING ANECDOTE OUR COMMODORE HAD BEEN A SENIOR CAPTAIN BEFORE THE WAR AND HE RETIRED OF COURSE HE WAS BROUGHT BACK IN AND MADE COMMODORE OF THE MINE SWEEPING FLEET HE HAD HIS TWELVE MINE SWEEPERS AND WE USED TO GO AND DO THE SAME THING EVERY DAY THE GERMANS BEING VERY MARTICULOUS WOULD COME OUT WELL SAY FRIDAYS AND TUESDAYS NOT ONLY THE SAME DAY BUT AT THE SAME TIME TO LAY THEIR MINDS AND THEN DASH BACK IN WE WENT OUT THE FOLLOWING MORNING EACH TIME TO PICK THEM UP AND THE SKIPPER GOT A BIT FED UP WITH THIS AND HE TOLD THE CONFERENCE OF HIS CAPTAINS ONE DAY IS THE NEXT TIME WE GO SWEEPING RUN YOUR TRAWLS OUT BUT DON'T DROP YOUR WIRES WHICH IS OF COURSE CONTRARY TO ALL NAVAL INSTRUCTIONS HE COULD HAVE GOT CAUGHT MARSHAL IF ANYTHING HAPPENED BUT WE WENT THROUGH THE GERMAN MINEFIELD AS THEY HAD LAID IT AND WE GOT AWAY WITH IT SO THE GERMANS CAME OUT AGAIN TO REPLACE THE MINES THEY THOUGHT WE'D PICKED UP AND THEY LOST FOUR OF THEIR OWN BOATS ON THEIR OWN MINES AND I DON'T THINK THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY SPORTING WAS THAT DOCUMENTED COMMENTED SOMEWHERE IN THE ADMIRALTY ARCHIVES YEAH AMAZING A GOOD IDEA HE COULD HAVE GOT INTO A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR THAT WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN WE WENT OUT I WAS DUE TO REPORT WITH SIX OTHER STEWARDS WE REPORTED TO THE FIRST LIEUTENANT WERE DAMAGED CONTROL PARTY IF THE SHIP GOT HIT WE HAD TO CLEAR THE DAMAGE WAY PUT OUT ANY FIRES AND PULL THE WOUNDED INTO THE WAR ROOM WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS WAITING TO DO WHAT HE COULD BUT FORTUNATELY IT NEVER HAPPENED BUT THAT WAS MY OFFICIAL STATION AND WHAT ABOUT BAD WEATHER AND STORMS AND STUFF DID YOU EVER ENCOUNTER ANY DANGERS WHEN YOU HAD WHAT ANY STORMS BAD WEATHER BIG SEAS WELL WE HAD SOME YES BUT WE STILL WENT OUT PUT ON YOUR SAIL WEST AND THAT WAS IT YOU HAD SAFETY LINES RIGGED FORE AND HALF SO YOU YOU HOLD ON TO THOSE YOU WOULDN'T GET WASHED OVERBOARD WHAT ABOUT DID YOU WHAT WAS IT LIKE WATCHING THE PLANES TAKING GOING OVER YOU AND STUFF DID YOU SEE MUCH ACTIVITY IN THE AIR WE WERE FORTUNATELY WE NEVER GOT ATTACK FROM THE AIR I DON'T THINK THEY THE GERMANS THOUGHT OUR LITTLE BOATS WERE WORTH WASTING A BOMB ON THEY WANTED HIM FOR THE CAPITAL CITIES OR THE AIR FIELDS WERE YOU INVOLVED IN D DAY AT ALL YES NOW A WEEK BEFORE D DAY THE BASE WAS SHUT DOWN LIKE AN OYSTER NOBODY COULD GO OFF NO ONE WAS ALLOWED IN FOR SECURITY REASONS OBVIOUSLY YOU COULDN'T GET ANY POST YOU COULDN'T MAKE ANY PHONE CALLS BECAUSE IT WAS COMING UP ALTHOUGH OFFICIALLY WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS BEFORE DAY ON ADMIRALTY INSTRUCTIONS WE STARTED NIGHT SWEEPING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DAY SHIFT SO THE GERMANS WERE GETTING USED TO THE IDEA OF US POPPING ALONG THE COAST DURING THE HOURS OF DARKNESS THEY WOULDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT SO THE EARLY MORNING OF D DAY WE WENT OUT AT MIDNIGHT AND WE WERE SWEEPING RIGHT UP TO THE LINE WHERE THE BATTLESHIPS WERE WAITING TO BOMBARD THE COAST WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE STATIONED AND WE SWEPT THAT MOST CAREFULLY AND THEN WE AS THEY STARTED COMING UP OUT OF THE DARKNESS FROM TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WAITING AND WE WERE TIRED BEHIND THEM THERE WASN'T ANYTHING ELSE FOR US TO DO WE GOT SENT BACK HERE TO THE ISLE OF SHEPPEY WHEN THE TROOPS WENT ASHORE WE WERE A BIT ANNOYED BECAUSE WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING AND THEN ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE DAYS LATER A SKIPPER GOT THE ORDERS TO PATROL THE DUTCH COAST ON THE SET AND PICK UP ALL THE MINES WHICH THE GERMANS HAD SOWN LIBERALLY ROUND ALL THE THE COAST THERE SO THAT KEPT US BUSY FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS AND WE WERE STATIONED AT A LITTLE TOWN CALLED TERNUZAN A VERY SMALL PORT BUT THERE WAS A LONG JETTY SO WE COULD MORE ALONGSIDE THERE AND IN THE EVENINGS LATE AFTERNOON YOU GOT SHORE LEAVE UNTIL YOU WERE GOING OFF AGAIN NEXT MORNING AND I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN THE THINGS WE SAW WHEN WE WENT ASHORE THE GERMANS HAD GOT OUT IN A HURRY AND THEIR SIGNS WERE EVERYWHERE ON A HOTEL LOUNGE THAT BEING IN AN OFFICERS MESS AND THE SIGNS WERE STILL UP AND THEY BLEW SOME OF THE BRIDGES OVER THE CANALS AS THEY LEFT AND THE DUTCH FLOODED SOME OF THE DIKES TO STOP THEIR HEAVY TRAFFIC GETTING AWAY AND I REMEMBER ONCE WE WENT ASHORE WE ALL CARRIED THE NAVY RAINCOAT DRAPED OVER YOUR ARM FOLDED IN A CERTAIN WAY AND THE OFFICER WATCH KNEW VERY WELL WE HAD THINGS IN THEIR POCKETS CIGARETTES PACKAGE OF BISCUITS A TINNERO JAM OR WHATEVER WHICH WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN OFF THE SHIP AND WE WERE GIVING IT TO THE DUTCH CIVILIANS BECAUSE THEY WERE AS STARVED AS HELL AND LOOKED VERY ILL AND ON THIS OCCASION WE GOT ASHORE AND I SAW A VERY THIN AGE LOOKING WOMAN COMING UP THE STREET PUSHING HER BATTERED PRAM AND SHE GOT TWO LITTLE KIDS IN THERE ABOUT THREE OR A BIT LESS I SUPPOSE AND ONE BLANKET COVER THEM AND OFF MY HAT GOOD DAY AND SHE GAVE ME A SMILE SHE COULDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH AND I COULDN'T SPEAK DUTCH BUT I TOOK OUT WHAT I HAD AND I PUT IT IN HER PRAM YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE LOOK ON HER FACE SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS COME TWICE BECAUSE WHAT THEY DIDN'T EAT THEY CAN ALWAYS TRADE FOR SOMETHING ELSE COULD HAVE GONE BACK WITH MORE BUT IT WASN'T TO BE AFTER WE GOT RID OF MOST OF THE MINES OF THE DUTCH COAST WE HAD A WEEK'S LEAVE WELL OBVIOUSLY WE WEREN'T COMING BACK HERE FOR IT WE WOULD BE ON THE DUTCH COAST AND I HAD ANOTHER FELLOW WE GOT ONTO THE MAIN ROAD WHICH WAS THE BRUSSELS ROAD LEADING INTO BELGIUM AND THUMBED LIFTS FROM ARMY WHICH ARE ALWAYS GOING UP AND DOWN AND WE GOT INTO ABOUT THREE THREE HOURS NO A BIT LESS INTO ROUGE WHICH IS ONE OF THEM WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITIES I'VE SEEN TWO CATHEDRALS AND OPERA HOUSE AND THE TOWN HALL AROUND FOUR SIDES OF THE MAIN SQUARE AND ONE OF THE HOTELS HAD BEEN TAKEN OVER AS A NAPPY FOR THE TROOPS BED AND BREAKFAST SO WE STAYED THERE AND WE ENJOYED OURSELVES THEN WHEN WE CAME BACK WE GOT ORDERED BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AND WE WERE STILL LOOKING FOR MINES WHICH MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED DETECTION GOING UP AND DOWN BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH URGENCY IN IT ANY MORE AND I DID PUT IN APPLICATION TO SIT FOR LEADING STEWARD BUT BEFORE THAT COULD TAKE PLACE MY DISCHARGE PAPERS CAME THROUGH AND THAT WAS IN THE EARLY EARLY NINETEEN SIX FORTY NINETEEN FORTY SIX NINETEEN NINETEEN FORTY SIX YES AFTER THE WAR YEAH BUT UNLIKE THE ARMY OR THE AIR FORCE WE GOT PLENTY OF NOTICE WHEN IT WAS COMING I KNOW PEOPLE IN THE AIR FORCE AND THEY WERE GIVEN THREE DAYS NOTICE FROM THERE AND THEY WERE OUT IN THE NAVY WE HAD TIME YOU WERE TOLD YOU'VE GOT TO BE DEMOBBED IN THREE MONTHS WELL THEY GIVE YOU TIME TO START LOOKING AROUND FOR A CIVILIAN JOB OR SOMEWHERE TO LIVE IF YOU'RE MARRIED WITH KIDS SO I THINK WE HAD A BETTER DEAL CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS MINE SWEEPING JUST EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WERE DOING AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MINES WELL LOOKED LIKE YARDS FROM THE MAIN MAST STRETCHED OUT EITHER SIDE ABOUT FIFTY FEET AND FROM THESE ARE DEPENDING VERY SHARP CUTTING WIRES WITH WEIGHTS ON THE END AS YOU GO TO THE WATER THE IDEA IS TO YOUR CUTTING WIRES TO CATCH THE MOORING WIRES FOR A MINE AND CUT IT THE MINE COMES TO THE SURFACE AND YOU WOULD DISPOSE OF IT HOW MANY MINES WOULD YOU FIND ON AN AVERAGE DAY ON A POSSIBLY A DOZEN POSSIBLY ONLY TWO IT VARIED AND THE DISPOSAL WOULD BE A SHOCK WOULD IT OR THAT'S WHAT IT STARTED WITH YES THEN THE GERMANS EVENTUALLY ERM ACOUSTIC MINE WHICH ERM WASN'T MORE IT WAS JUST DROPPED IN THE CHANNEL HOPEFULLY IN THE PATH OF ONCOMING SHIPS AND IT EMITTED A MAGNETIC FIELD FROM ERM BATTERIES THAT WERE INSIDE AND EVERY SHIP AS IT GOES ALSO MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD AND WHEN THE TWO COLLIDE THE MINE GOES UP SO WE HAD TO HAVE WHAT WAS CALLED GAZING EQUIPMENT A SPECIAL COIL FITTED RIGHT ROUND THE SHIP AND THE CURRENT IS PASSED THROUGH THAT ANTI CLOCKWISE AND THAT NULLIFIES THE EFFECT OF THE ELECTRONIC FIELD AND YOU COULD GO OVER MINES YOU'D BE ALRIGHT COULD YOU FIND THOSE MINES WE FOUND HIM YES SOMETIMES THE GERMANS GOT CRAFTED AND THEY DROPPED SOME OF THESE MINES AT NIGHT FROM LOW FLYING PLANES AND WE GOT BACK I WASN'T THERE I WAS ON A COUPLE OF DAYS LEAVE AND I WENT HOME TO MAIDSTONE BUT I WAS TOLD AS OUR SQUADRON CAME BACK FROM PATROL AND THE LAST SHIP IN SLID INTO ITS PLACE ON THE JETTY AND PROBABLY BLEW UP BECAUSE THERE WAS A MINE UNDERNEATH BEING DROPPED BY A PLANE AND THE SKIPPER OF THIS LAST BOAT AS IT WAS ONLY SIX FEET FROM THE JETTY HE GOT HIS GAZE EQUIPMENT SWITCH OFF I THINK THERE WAS TWO SURVIVORS BUT WHO THEY WERE I DON'T KNOW HOW WOULD YOU FIND I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD FIND A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING IN THE WATER YOU CUT IT AND IT FLOATS TO THE TOP HOW DID YOU FIND THESE MAGNETIC MINES WERE THEY ON THE BOTTOM OR THEY'RE ON THE BOTTOM YES HOW WOULD YOU FIND THAT WELL WE LIKE A SONAR DEVICE IT PICKS UP THE RADIATION FROM THE MINE AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHERE IT IS YOU CAN DROP A DEPTH CHARGE ON IT YOU SET THE DEPTH CHARGE FOR TWENTY FEET OR THIRTY WHATEVER IT IS AND JUST POPPED THEM OVER THE SIDE ON A GUN IN HOLLAND WHEN YOU GOT TO HOLLAND YOU TALKED TO LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMORIES OF JUST THE DEVASTATION WHEN THE GERMANS GOT OUT ARE THEY TOOK EVERYONE WITH THEM ALIVE OR DEAD AND BLEW A COUPLE OF BRIDGES AND THEN RETREATED TOWARDS BELGIUM DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE WINNING THE WAR AT THAT STAGE YES THE GREAT DAY HAD COME THE INVASION HAD STARTED AND WE WERE PUSHING INLAND FROM THE BEACHES WE HADN'T BEEN SHOVED BACK OFF AGAIN AND IT WAS STARTING TO BITE WHEN YOU WERE PULLED OUT OF D DAY DID YOU WERE YOU WERE YOU ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WAS GOING ON ON D DAY AFTER THE BATTLE SHIPS HAD ARRIVED YOU'D COME BACK TO BASE DIDN'T YOU WERE YOU AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR THE GUNS GOING ON THE WHEN THE MEN BROADSIDE STARTED YES I THINK THAT WAS QUARTER TO SIX AND EIGHT MILES OF SHIPS ALL OPENED UP AT THE SAME TIN AND WE ALREADY GOT INFORMATION FROM THE UNDERGROUND RESISTANCE WORKERS WHERE THE GERMAN STRONG POINTS WERE ALL ALONG THE CLIFF TOPS HEAVY GUN EMPLACEMENTS BUNKERS FOR TROOPS AND SO ON AND THEY GOT CONTINUOUS PLASTERING AND THEY HADN'T QUITE FINISHED IT WAS A TWO HOUR BOMBARDMENT AND ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE IT STOPPED THE BOATS WERE GOING ASHORE WITH THE TROOPS DID YOU HEAR IT WE WERE ON THE PEOPLE BEHIND THEM WE HEARD IT ALRIGHT WAS SUCH A DEFINITE CRESCENDO OF NO THERE WAS NO NOTHING LIKE IT YOU WEREN'T EVEN NEAR IT NO WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER VE DAY OH THAT WAS AGAIN MARVELLOUS I WAS WAITING THE MOB AND OF COURSE WE GOT RATHER MORE LEAVE ONCE PEACE WAS DECLARED AND I GOT ERM I THINK IT WAS A FOUR DAY PASS TO GO HOME TO MAIDSTONE AND I CAME UP ON THE TRAIN TO VICTORIA AND THE PLACE WAS JUST ONE SEETHING MASS OF PEOPLE EVERY COLOUR EVERY UNIFORM EVERY THING YOU COULD THINK OF EVERYONE WAS SINGING DANCING LAUGHING AND WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS BECAUSE THEY LET THE HAIR DOWN AND IN FRONT OF THE BUCKINGHAM PALACE YOU COULDN'T HAVE GOT A SHOE HORN IN THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS STRETCHING BACK DOWN THEM ALL WAITING FOR THE KING AND QUEEN AND WINSTON TO COME ON THE BALCONY AND THE ROAR THAT WENT UP MUST HAVE GONE ON FOR ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES NON STOP HOW DO YOU REFLECT ON YOUR NAVY SERVICE NOW I'M I'M GLAD I WENT IT MEANS I AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS DON'T HAVE TO READ ABOUT HISTORY WE WERE MAKING IT WE WERE PART OF THAT HISTORY AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF ARE THERE ANY OTHER STORIES YOU WANT TO SHARE I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY NO AS I SAY MINE EVEN IS A VERY DULL OCCUPATION WITH OCCASIONAL SHORT PERIODS OF ACTIVITY BUT UNLIKE DESTROYERS OR BATTLE SHIPS YOU'RE NOT ENGAGED PERMANENTLY WITH WITH THE OPPOSITE NUMBER WERE THERE ANY OCCASIONS WHERE YOU WERE ENGAGED NO WE WERE NEVER ATTACKED BY PLANES AS I SAID AND WE DIDN'T SEE ANY GERMAN TROOPS THE ONLY CONTACT WE HAD WAS WHEN THEIR LONG RANGE GUNS ON THE FRENCH COAST TRIED TO GET US WHILE WE WERE MINE SWEEPING BUT THEY DIDN'T WHAT
