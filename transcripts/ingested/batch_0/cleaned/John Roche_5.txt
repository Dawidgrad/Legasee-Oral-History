what do you remember of some of the early arctic convoys that you did we were normally sort of distance support for the aircraft carriers battleships and battle cruisers and the convoy was assembled normally in the north of scotland then they would go up to iceland we were based in iceland and when the convoy sailed we would sail at the same time and then it all sort of depended on the danger we was expecting whilst we were behind the convoy to the side of the convoy in front of it or whatever really there were german destroyers and other ships and they were always worried about the bismarck coming out which was based in norway so our prime aim was to stop the battle ships interfering with the convoys so we were normally in the middle of the convoy but now and again we would sometimes pass the convoy or move close to it you'd see the convoy with maybe thirty forty ships steaming along and we would sometimes steam through the middle of it what was that like it was very enlightening really there were a lot of older ships and they was struggling to keep up the speed of course and a lot of them were coal burning ships i felt sorry for the poor suckers below shovelling coal to try and keep the ships doing nine or ten knots or something we only had to press a button and we could do thirty knots so that was the main thing the convoys were pretty slow it was so cold and the seas were pretty rough there was a lot of bad weather which you had to contend with some of the ships would even ice over we would go up in the morning and you would see all the guns and everything else covered in black ice it would come over during the nights time and it would freeze we had to go round with chipping hammers and chip the ice off there were cases of smaller ships turning over because it would be top heavy with ice the ship rolled and never came back what do you remember of the cold well i remember going on watch i mean we didn't have any of today's weather clothing we only had our ordinary gear and maybe we would get issued with long johns and things like that you could put a couple pairs of trousers on and a couple of coats on we only had duffle coats and balaclavas we used to get some bag of goodies come on board if somebody done some knitting we used to look like pirates if you like once we put all our gear on and maybe two pairs of gloves to go on watch then if you came off watch you would have to stand around in case you needed to go to your action stations you just laid down on the deck and went to sleep with all your clothes on you wouldn't have time to put it all on once the action station sound went off you might stay in the same gear for a week if a ship was torpedoed or something people wouldn't have a chance they would end up in the water and you'll only live for about two minutes then you'd be frozen solid i should think you talked about putting binoculars to your face just describe that yes you had to breathe on them before you put them up to your face and you had to make sure you kept them near your body to keep them slightly warm because anything cold you could nearly burn yourself with ice i suppose the cold weather was the main thing it was very cold and rough rough seas did you ever get to polyarny or murmansk no we got on the outskirts and then we turned around and picked up another convoy and came back again so that wasn't any anchorages for big ships there the escorts could go in because they would also have to pick up another convoy or go in and do a little bit of maintenance and things like that the bigger ships they stood off so we didn't actually land in russia did you see any u boats we had plenty of alarms as soon as an alarm went off we would alter course and buzz off in the other direction as far as seeing them we didn't see any we knew they were in the area you'd hear a bang or a ship being torpedoed or something and we were usually screened with destroyers keeping us safe from u boats we hoped any u boat alarm and we would alter course quickly did you ever see any ships go down we did see a couple of them go down in the distance you could see them and then all of a sudden there would be a big bang and then there would be nothing there if there were u boats near us we would be shepherded away in another direction to get them away from us the u boats would have had interest in sinking us if they got the chance but we could go a bit faster renown would have been a difficult target for a u boat in those days they only done about eight or nine knots in the water compared to our twenty
