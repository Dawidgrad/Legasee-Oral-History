my name is cornelius snelling my age is ninety i will be ninety one in a few weeks' time i joined the royal navy as a conscript in nineteen forty two as an ordinary seaman i did my basic training at hms ganges at shotley and after or during the training i was made a class leader and at the end of my training period i was moved to the royal naval barracks at chatham and from chatham i waited for a draft to a ship just tell me where are you from and why did you want to get into the navy i was the first person in the family if you like to go to sea somehow i had that wish to go to sea my fear was under conscription that i might be conscripted into the army even though i did a period serving in the local defence volunteer and subsequently the home guard and my home guard period was in london at waterloo station which received bombing and so i had a good baptism of fire with the blitz before i went into the navy anything you can remember from the blitz you wanted to share whilst we are here sorry is there any stories from the blitz you want to share when you're here yes a little story an air raid was in progress and i was in an office building above the concourse of waterloo station and a bomb came through and penetrated the cab road to the waterloo and city railway behind the tube and my reaction when i heard this bomb was to dive under a desk and the next thing i remember was somebody shouting put that bloody light out what had happened the window frames had been blown out but the pendant on which the electric light was hanging was still intact and giving light which might of attracted the enemy to drop yet another bomb so that was a number of events before i went into the royal navy and what do you remember of those early days of the navy and what it was like going from you know a young boy to the beginnings of becoming a sailor yes the training was quite arduous and in fact leave was very limited under training and i found it quite tough and i was given the responsibility of the class leader and one of the requirements on such an individual was to keep the mess tidy and also to ensure that the occupants were properly dressed etc at the appointed times when you say it was arduous do you mean it was physical or mentally or both i would say both because you did boat work that in whalers where you had that was in the river orwell opposite harwich and also gunnery training even to climbing the mast they had a safety net and somebody wrote a book about ganges they said if you came off the yard arm and hit the safety net you went through as chips but did you ever fall off no i didn't witness anybody falling from the yard arm but that was quite arduous climbing the rigging did you have a head for heights i think when you're young your fairly fearless i'm not speaking about action but that sort of training there is also physical training as well that took part of the training and as far as swimming was concerned you had to swim the length of the swimming bath with what was called a duck suit that was a heavy linin suit or uniform and if you failed to complete the length of the bath you had extra periods of training until you were able to accomplish that feat when did you get you know your port division well three port divisions chatham which sadly no longer exists portsmouth and devonport out of interest i found with experience on occasion when we went into devonport from a patrol that went ashore there was always friction between the ships company other than devonport for example if a chatham ship went into devonport might possible cause a little bit of opposition don't know why but when did you get assigned to your port division was that straight away immediately on completion of my training and i think it had i've got no evidence of this but the family lived at kingston upon thames and i think being nearer london and kent that you became a chatham and what do you remember of chatham the place the barracks it was pretty tough the for example the food was pretty appalling they would be cooking breakfast because of the number of bodies that had to be fed they would start cooking say the previous afternoon so the congealed bacon and eggs and what have you were hard you waited in chatham barracks for your number and name to be called and you went there was a drafting office you didn't know whether you was going to be drafted to a battleship cruiser or what and in my case i was told to report for i was given a number and this number involved travelling to glasgow from chatham to scotstoun yarrows yard and i arrived there had an overnight journey i was moved from charring cross station to euston station by lorry and an overnight journey as i mentioned to glasgow and when i arrived at glasgow the rto he told me to go to yarrows yard and i found a bird class ship which was hms wildgoose it was brand new it hadn't been commission into the royal navy so i had a good baptism of fire in a sense that i went out on sea trials flying the red duster and she proved to be a very seaworthy and acceptable to the captain and commander weems and we returned back to the clyde and we commissioned her and flew the white ensign after that we went to tobermory in scotland the western isles for anti submarine training and we were under an old commodore who was his name was he was nick named the terror of tobermory he was old navy very very strict and he would send a signal to abandon ship about midnight and you had to release all your carley floats and sea boats and what have you scrambling nets and by the time you resecured the ship it was time to turn to the next day so it was pretty tough training from a very ordinary green seaman you were knocked into shape and of course after that we after the training at tobermory we were sent to liverpool to merseyside to join other ships of the same type and carrying the same names named after bird life to form the second support group and our job was basically not really convoy escort we would hunt the u boat packs not only in the north atlantic but also in the bay of biscay because the germans had u boat pens at places like st nazaire st nazaire and they still exist today la rochelle and we were quite successful you're a very green sailor whose been sent north from chatham and your first ship is brand new can you remember what it was like when you saw it and how you were received on the ship and what you did well it was in the wild goose when i arrived at yarrows yard it was in dry dock and it looked terribly small to me and i thought my god am i going to sea in that but i was made my first job on the wild goose i was bosuns mate in other words i was responsible to the coxswain i remember that i lacked naval terms and i said we were out on sea trials and i said to the coxswain permission to go down stairs' and he said where do you think you are on the bloody queen mary' and i said no coxswain' and he said you must use naval language' terminology should i say so i quickly learnt what was your mess deck like and what were the people like you were with on the mess what was your group like i was in number one mess and we had what was called canteen messing and the galleys were pretty small on those ships and we didn't have bunks we slept in hammocks and at sea we had for example we would sail with a supply of bread from ashore but the galley wasn't sufficient adequate to provide bread so often hen the shore supply deteriorated we had to exist on ships biscuits milk carnation milk for example so ones diet was completely changed even though ashore during the second world war we had rationing and food was extremely difficult was it a happy ship do you think a very happy ship in fact on our first patrol and we arrived back we had some success i can't remember the number of u boats we attacked captain walker came onto the wild goose when we alongside and he spoke very strictly about not stating to anybody else what are activities were in case it got to the ears of the enemy and i remember i've got a photograph there i can show you and the lower deck was cleared and he spoke to us quite strongly but he was a great leader and for that reason i'm sitting here today can you please describe the role of wild goose about your role on that patrol so first of all the role of the wild goose as a ship and what it was doing the role of the wild goose together with six or seven other sloops of the same class search areas i wouldn't say adjacent to a convoy but if you like screening a convoy and other areas such as the bay of biscay the aim was to try and stop the u boats getting into the atlantic sea lanes and we would search day and night to if the asdic operator contacted or it was thought that there was a u boat then we would we would hunt the area if you like and if we had identified the u boat we would start to attack by dropping depth charges so in terms of this search how does the ship how are you working alongside these other ships just describe the approach the technique the ability to communicate to each other well the ability was in the second world war we didn't have closed bridges they were open bridges and they would either signal by aldis lamp between the ships the operation was commanded by the senior which was frederick walker and he would then detail say wild goose to go in and attack dropping depth charges at pre determined depth the depth charges on the lower deck weren't primed until action stations was sounded and it was decided or calculated what the depth of the u boat was captain walker wasn't on your ship then no he wasn't on my ship well he did on one occasion because the starling i've a photograph i can show you when it rammed a u boat and it damaged the forehead part of the ship and that was dispatched back to devonport and walker took command of the wild goose my ship and sent commander weems to command starling to go back to devonport for repair the admiralty wasn't too happy when you rammed and damaged the ship and we had one occasion in the bay of biscay we found some tuna fish trawlers six of them they were outside their territorial waters and we considered they were reporting our locations to the germans so we marshalled the six trawlers together and transferred the crews of five of them onto one and we gave a very large tin of corn beef and instructed them to sail back to their own home port and we sunk the other five with gunnery practice what is your role then when you go to action stations or even before what are you doing onboard the wild goose well at action stationed i was in a gun magazine down below you were clipped down so if the ship was hit you were finished because when action stations is sounded a ship is divided into sections and each section has water tight doors so that if the ship is hit in any way say the aft part of the ship is hit you could stay afloat even though it was badly damaged because with the aid of water tight hatches and doors they were all clipped at action stations and what are you doing down there then i was feeding shells to the a gun magazine that was my action stations but other than that i was bosuns mate and feeding these magazine or shells is it shells or magazines shells how is that being fed are you literally loading the barrel or are you just it goes on a lift to the turret if you look forehead of the ship there're twins six inch shells and they were fed up to the actual gun team in the turret is a turret the one right at the front yes and are these shells heavy fairly heavy but they were about that size and i think the heaviest job of it was the depth charges handling those because they were either rolled over from the stern and what was it like to be in action stations when you're down below locked in what's the noise like what's the feeling like what's the energy like you were really searching to know what was happening up above you because you didn't get any sort of communication as such you know you weren't told what was precisely happening obviously there was the link between the turret and the actual storage of the shells are you on your own down there or was there a few of you i think there was two of us down there for one turret there would have been another magazine there was three turrets they were twins each turret was twin and there was two of us for each turret and how are they communicating with you how are they saying get us another one and another one i think it was a bell system and it was fed on a type of lift from the magazine to the gun or turret and you could be down there for how long well you could be down there for almost twenty four hours if you were in it depended how long action stations lasted and you were unclipped the only problem was the feeling you know you wanted to know what was happening and there wasn't that form of communication to explain why the ship was at action stations we basically knew it was detecting a u boat or a u boat had started to breach the surface but on one patrol we sunk six u boats there is a photograph on the table there we were cheered into gladstone dock in liverpool when you say we do you mean the flotilla or the wild goose no the flotilla gladstone dock was locked there was a large loch which would take two of the sloops coming in from the mersey which was tidal of course when you were looking for subs i suppose it was action stations you had to go below well your action station was actually allocated to you and you were responsible to get to your action station as quickly as possible so did you ever witness a sub go down no not really no there was one occasion when survivors were picked up we wouldn't pick up incidentally survivors if the ship was in danger but we would a decision was made not to pick up survivors as i say if it was putting the ship at risk did the wild goose ever pick up survivors yes we picked up survivors we treated them if they gave the nazi salute we would put them in the depth charge locker because the depth charges weren't primed they were primed separately at action stations but if they were reasonable we applied the geneva convention for prisoners of war but you know if they did the nazi salute we certainly didn't accept that did you meet any did you speak to any no i didn't meet any because if they were if there was a commissioned person then they were dealt with in the ward room but the lower deck they were allocated to part of the ship but they were obviously even though they weren't practicing being a fascist they were under guard and clearly if we went to action stations subsequently finding another u boat they would be kept under guard what was the rescue strategy what was it terms of how you operated well the germans they wore a may west and they had inflatable dinghies and they were brought alongside and we had scrambling nets and they scrambled to get inboard must have been a strange feeling having germans onboard the ship well can i say this there was very few survivors from u boats because unless they surfaced under attack they used to throw debris through their torpedo tubes to pretend they had been sunk but we had echo sounding gear if we got a shape of the u boat but there was one problem because of the number of wrecks laying in the atlantic you could get an image on the echo sounders of a hull and it could be a sunken merchantman instead of a u boat but that was pretty elementary to other methods of detection the detection mainly is with the asidc system and that proved a great asset in hunting the u boats you touched on walker but what made him did you meet him why did you feel such a great level of respect for him well he was recognised in the royal navy as being if you like the supreme of anti submarine warfare it wasn't until the outbreak of war and the problems which arose with the loss of ships particularly in the north atlantic the admiralty recognised his ability of defeating the u boat what about aerial attacks were you ever attacked from above in the bay of biscay there were occasion when the raf the raf was somewhat limited in i'm trying to explain to you the the bay of biscay was in range of the raf and the americans so there was in fact coordination between the operation of the ship hunting as well as the aircraft but turning back to the north atlantic that was somewhat restricted it was only with surface craft on uboat hunting were you ever attacked by germans from the air in the bay no not to my knowledge no did you ever lose a man when you were doing these operations of the wild goose did anyone ever die no no we had one we didn't incidentally have a doctor a ship's doctor we had for example one of the crew members he had an acute appendicitis and there was a doctor on hms starling captain walker ship and he was brought over and this guy was operated on the mess deck table so it was pretty i wouldn't say we had a sick berth attendant but he wasn't you know able to deal with that sort of problem so how long were you on the wild goose and where else did you sail the last job i did on the wild goose was an artic convoy i was then dispatched to brighton for an interview with the admiralty board because i had expressed my wish to go into the fleet air arm air crew and they sent me from brighton to the royal haslar hospital at gosport for this additional medical and i failed so i went back to general service and i was hoping i was ultimately get a commission but i joined the wild goose in near londonderry and it was an american built escort the tyler they were built in twenty eight days because the royal navy was very very short of escort ships and we had i think it must have been about forty eight or fifty destroyer escorts from the states in fact in the end of the second world war i took her back to philadelphia naval yard and they were all welded there is one example for a period i operated out of belfast and they brought in one of that class of ship called the red mill it had been torpedoed forehead and aft and it was only the midship section remained afloat the reason for that was it had been welded it just buckled up forehead and aft and stayed afloat whereas if it had been a plated ship like the wild goose it would have gone down just tell me what do you remember of that first artic convoy you did it was fairly i considered that if i could use the word better than prior to that particular convoy we had taken fuel at reykjavik in iceland and started to screen a convoy but we didn't go as far as murmansk whereas the convoy the last convoy i was on went to murmansk the conditions we were i think fortunate that we didn't we had some air attack but apart from that it was fairly quiet reasonable did you go ashore at murmansk yes only for about two or three days and then we were back on the return leg and what do you remember of murmansk they were quite friendly and we sort of exchanged there was a bit of a language difficulty but we sort of chatted away and what have you and offer them cigarettes and what have you you may not realise and this has risen up subsequently every time i've had a medical problem and i'm sure in your case they ask whether you smoked now we had tobacco issues in the royal navy did you realise that there was duty free cigarettes and in addiction there was a monthly issue of half pound tin of either cigarette tobacco or pipe tobacco or the old hands as i classified them the regulars tobacco leaf and they sued to impregnate the leaf in rum and then lash it up to mature and then would cut it off when it had matured to smoke i did smoke a pipe in the navy but i remember one of the old hands giving me a pipe of that and it nearly knocked my head off be illegal nowadays exactly and what about rum rations and the extra shot and stuff like that well when we sunk a u boat we spliced the mainbrace the rum ration it was neat depended on which submarines it was neat on small craft similar to wild goose and so on and indeed the tyler that was neat if it was a cruiser like the belfast and that was i think was one and one why was it a better ration on a smaller ship well because life was arduous the facilities as i tried to explain earlier comfort was minimal can i put it that way how's the rum ration divided out what did you do were you called to a spot or did he goes round it was announced rum was being issued at i think eleven o'clock each day assuming you weren't at action stations it was issued it was measured there was a tub and normally obviously it was supervised and each man was given you know what was called a tot was it nice well it was when you're in the middle of the north atlantic and on an artic convoy what do you remember back to the artic talk to me about the cold and living conditions what it was like to live in those conditions on small ships you were never a you were never dry and you have you know additional clothing issued you had a long coat i recall the long johns like barb wire but there was also you know additional clothing from a charity point of view the ships you know would sort of have i wouldn't say parcels but some additional clothing and we had issues of duffle coats and things like that normally you have to buy everything in the navy don't you were you having to buy this or was this because you were doing artic convoys you were given it you were issued with it initially you didn't have to buy a uniform you were under training i think subsequently you paid particularly if you were commissioned you know you had to pay up front sort of thing did you have any slip or fall over because the decks were quite icy did you have any near moments well as far as the ice was concerned it could affect the stability of the ship if you were confronted with a lot of ice the ship could become virtually top heavy so it was extremely it was an urgent matter to chip the ice away literally just the one artic convoy yes but we also did the screening as well on the wild goose but not on the tyler now i think the reason for that was that the question of the form of construction the welding although i understand a lot of the merchantman the americans they had these liberty ships and they were all welded and they did go on to artic convoys i think there was a feeling i haven't seen it in black and white but it was judged that they weren't suitable for artic conditions did you choose to come of the wild goose or was it an opportunity too good to miss no i was selected to i think under training at the end of training i was asked virtually what course i wanted to take in the navy and it sort of emerged from there and were you sad to leave the wild goose i was sad but i thought this was following my career in the navy which i had you know really had sort of focused on and what about this failed eye test you must of been gutted i was i was absolutely broken hearted really i was young enough i mean we were flying swordfish in those days i say we that was one of the aircraft i don't know if you've spoke to jimmy i think he was i don't know what he was in fleet air arm avengers rear gunner oh rear gunner that wasn't a very happy situation no he did well to last same question really what was it like going to the tyler what do you remember of your first sight of that and how you felt what you did it was a peculiar situation it had been an american base and on the other side of the loch was the free state but the tyler was ferried over from american to by a new zealand crew so we were formed of a crew from chatham division and because i'd failed to get into the fleet air arm i'd gone back to chatham from brighton in fact i spent some time ironically at guildford technical college which is now part of guildford university guildford technical college was called hms shrapnel and that was training on radar and so on of course radar was in its very early the bird class were equipped with radar which is in its infancy what did you think of tyler when you saw her then well it was somewhat different to a british built ship the americans gave great priority to ships comforts there was no hammocks they were bunks there was drinking fountains and things like that and my role was actually doing the ships writing in the ships office it was quite well equipped and i think i felt the fighting efficiency was less than on a british ship which i had experience what made you say that well the armament was it could of carried torpedoes but for some reason it was decided not to just to concentrate on anti submarine anti u boat warfare and obviously depth charges and depth charge facilities but as far as the gunnery side it was much less powerful than the ones on the bird class sloop what were your action stations on the tyler my action stations there was basically assisting with the depth charges priming and so on so at last you're on deck yes i was on deck and what do you remember of tyler's sort of first operations then we followed we were grouped together as with the bird class sloops and we weren't' as successful as walkers groups but nevertheless we did sink a few u boats but i think it was because the walkers expertise you know was greater than other leaders tackling the same problem were you in the same operational zone well we operated manly in the north atlantic ironically the worst weather i ever suffered was around cape wrath in scotland we had the this was on the tyler and we had for example lockers on the upper deck welded to the deck itself they were washed away and the forehead gun on the tyler the mounting was damaged i really thought we were going to capsize and in fact i went to d day on the tyler we were one of the first ships in i was going to ask you about that in a minute just going back to this storm you know describe what it's like on a relatively small ship in a huge storm what the waves were like the movement of the ship what do you do how do you survive it well you just as far as the upper deck was concerned apart from the bridge you sort of kept away from the upper deck because you know obviously they were virtually awash you see on the lower part of the for example the tyler why is that the wild goose sorry the wild goose the aft section the aft deck it's very low in the water and they normally have a life line a strap hanging in a tube with a rope lashing and an eye on the rope to hold on with a knuckle knot at the end of the rope and that was one method as i said earlier but absolutely essential for you to be on the upper deck during a storm apart form on the bridge you'd keep off the lower deck because you're almost guaranteed to go over the side i would suggest did you ever see any huge seas yes terrific seas and the ship would get the screws coming out of the water when you went into a trough of a huge wave and you've got these thunderous screws until it sort of came up right and the forehead section would go up in the air tell me about the italian landings and what made that a different experience for you well it was really the first type of seaborne landing i'd experienced in the navy i mean elsewhere they'd been particularly in the far east this was in basically in the bay of naples and i felt that the to compare that subsequently with d day was somewhat easier job than d day what was the ship doing what was your responsibility to escort landing craft in the bay of naples basically similar to d day accept with d day we had things like the mulberry harbour and what have you which i'll come to in a moment what was it like to be out in the med after doing all this atlantic and north you know bering sea convoys what was it like to get down there well it seemed incredible because of the temperature the variation in the temperature we didn't really have terribly good ventilation we didn't certainly have air conditioning and it seemed to be the reverse situation you were perspiring if i can put it gently that way i did get ashore there and it was a peculiar situation that you were that they were the italians seemed to be short of soap so we took soap from the ship and exchanged cameos and i remember getting one for my mother and one for my sister as a present but that was when things got a little quiet there i was going to say with the landings what sort of resistance was there not to me it was not so major as i imagined at the time can i ask what does the skipper do before a day like that how are you told what you are going to be doing and when are you told and how does he get everybody normal it's sealed orders and they're opened by him normally when the ship is well under way on a particular course and he will then speak to the crew and say what you know what the program was going to be if i can use the word program what the activity was going to be what was expected of the ship cast your mind back if you can to what was it like on june four th june fifth when you were told about what was coming up can i set the scene by saying it was incredible we were all in the solent off of ryde and there was pluto pluto being the pipeline there was sections of mulberry harbour and we guessed there was something big going to happen but everything was very secretive i remember that i went ashore in the ships boat in the signal tower in the dockyard at portsmouth do you know portsmouth at all in portsmouth there is a public house right on the waterfront and we decided that i had to go to the dockyard and they had the ships postman we thought we were going to be very clever so we sort of hoved too by the pub and the ships boat adjacent to the pub the idea being when we'd done our business in the dockyard we would have a drink in the pub secretly but unfortunately snelling prejudged the tide and when we came back we was without water and there was a hell of a cry because we was due back to the ship and we got the ships motorboat without water anyway we managed to survive that with some sort of excuse but getting back to the point they had a liberty boat that used to go around to the various ships which were moored around in the solent we weren't basically told that it was going to happen but we certain we thought there was going to be something big we sailed on june fifth in the evening and when we were underway the captain getting to your point the captain opened his orders and told us we were going to escort landing craft or going towards the par de calais and then coming back to escort the landing craft in and what i did initially was to patrol anti submarine it think the germans thought we were going a landing was going to be attempted but it was going to be the par de calais and not normandy that was the strategy and we were one of the first ships in on d day and things like the warspite i'd never seen a battleship or battle cruiser firing it's fifteen inch turrets it's incredible something i would never forget and after the initial impact we would dispatch back to portsmouth then to escort the supply ships and things like pluto and so on to be escorted back to the beach heads and the weather deteriorated that's when we lost one of the mulberry harbour fortunately the british one was called port winston and that survived but the weather did eisenhower was worried apparently over the weather conditions and it was june sixth was judged to be the right based on the forecast can you try and describe what you saw what i saw because of the draft on the ship we couldn't actually beach but it was just i won't say hell but sort of flak everywhere and so on in the direction of the major ships firing and also the return from the german turrets and what i felt i felt personally i just thought that the guys on the landing craft i mean they'd been scooped up some of them some of them did come from ships which had smaller landing craft attached to them but others they crossed the channel cooped up and they weren't seaman they were army chaps which we would call in the navy pongos they must've been violently sick and what have you before landing how far were you from the beaches then in terms of yardage could you see the men running onto the beaches and stuff well you could basically see the landing craft going in but it was the depth the state of the tide which was a critical i mean clearly we didn't want to go a ground and become a sitting duck and you know after the initial impact we were then instructed to sail back to portsmouth to then start to escort the supplies over and what have you were you firing at the time were you there to provide bombing support as well well we didn't use our turret at all i think it was felt the ships like the warspite and i think the nelson was there and when fifteen inch guns are firing it's a bit hellish what is said can you feel it if you're near enough yes definitely you feel this sort of kick from that sort of power it's incredible are there any stand out memories or any stories that you can remember apart from obviously nearly not making it no the memories in the number of ships and the amount of equipment it seemed absolutely incredible and whilst we wasn't sent in the top secret one imagined that something big was about to happen with things like the pluto being moored near ryde peer and you know seeing sections of the mulberry harbour it was an incredible operation i think it was organised down to a piece of toilet paper i don't think it will be done again today after d day we were patrolling st georges channel where the u boats were trying to get through the onto the artic convoys and that was quite successful that we were able to confine their operations mainly they were coming from their bases in both in the atlantic seaboard and from the north sea areas and coming through the english channel and we had great success in the sinking of a lot of u boats there mainly the u boat losses were horrific and the loss of personnel i know our losses in the battle of the atlantic was also very very high both royal navy and merchant navy are there any other stories that you want to share post d day i know on the tyler we lost our we had our asdic dome damaged in the hull of the ship and we went in to milford haven for urgent repairs dockyard there was reopened and we had shore leave and we went to the nearest town which is it was near haberford west we went by train and we foolishly didn't judge what the return time was so we borrowed some bicycles to get back to the ship in time and we left them outside the police station and then the ship sailed on time after the repairs because i think we were honest when i say borrowed some bicycles in haberford west to enable us to get back because there wasn't a train we were at the end of the war we were told to take the tyler to the united states to take it back and we went into philadelphia navy yard and the americans were exceedingly kind if you wanted to listen to the orchestra if you wanted horse riding you could if you wanted they had a setup called the stage door canteen and they had hostesses and you could eat and dance but you weren't allowed to date the girls but i've got very happy memories the way we were treated in fact the american one of the americans he sent a food parcel home to my parents because they were at the end of the war they were still on rations in england so it is a happy memory i have with the americans once small little snippet on one patrol we had the gangway down i think it was in liverpool and a dog came up the gangway and was rather delighted with the food it received and it came out to sea on a patrol with us and i think it was named tizzer after the drink tizzer can you remember the drink tizzer we nicknamed it tizzer and when we returned safely from a patrol the gangway went down and who was the first one ashore but tizzer and we never saw it again apparently he didn't like sealife although it was fed regularly and looked after i mentioned to you earlier about the red mill which was the same class of ship as the tyler that had been torpedoed forehead and aft and one of the crew members was related to my late wife and this chap his mother received notice from the admiralty that we'd been lost on the red mill and he subsequently was found to of survived and it's strange that i saw the red mill towed in when we were in belfast when it was towed in and it was in a terrible state in fact the dockyard workers refused to extract the bodies and live ammunition in the wreckage so they had to detail naval working partied to do the job and how do you feel about the fact it was at last the end of the war in a sense thankfully i came through unscathed in a sense
