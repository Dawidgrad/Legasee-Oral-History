AND MOVE YOUR ARMS YOU WERE PHYSICALLY FIT I WAS TOLD TO GO HOME AND WAIT AND I'D BE CONTACTED WEEK LATER TONVO CAME REPORT TO CHATHAM BARRACKS ON SUCH AND SUCH A DAY I WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE WAR WITHOUT ACTUALLY SEEING A GERMAN WE HAD LONG RAGED FIGHTS WITH THEM BUT I NEVER ACTUALLY SAW A GERMAN UWHY YOU KNOW YOU WANTED TO DO YOUR BIT BUT WHY DID YOU NOT JOIN THE ARMY OR THE RF IAS NOT INTERESTED IN EITHER A TRADITIONAL FAMILY AND MY FATHER WAS IN THE NAVY SO WAS MY GRANDFATHER AND AN UNCLE MY GRANDFATHER WAS ON BEATINGIS FLAGSHIP THE LION AT THE BATTLE OF JHATLAND COME ON DECK FOR THREE DAYS HE WAS IN THE ENGINEERING BRANCH BUT THAT'S THE SERVICE I WANTED TO JOIN SO I DID WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF YOUR TRAINING IT'S RATHER CONFUSED WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND YOU DON'T TAKE THINGS IN SO EASILY BUT FROM PEMBROKE HOUSE PEMBROKE BARRACKS WE WERE ALL MARCHED DOWN TO FURTHER DOWN THE YARD WHER WE GOT FITTED OUT AND AT THAT TIME EVERYOE LESSO AN OFFICER WARE THE SAME FAND HALF BRIG WITH BEL BOTTOMS THE SCATHE HAT SENT UP TO SKAGNESS WITH ANOTHER BUNCH TO BUTLYNS HOLIDAY CAMP AND THAT BECAME HMS ROYAL ARTHUR AND I WAS TO START TRAINING AS A TELEGRAPHIST SIGNALLER ADI'V BEEN DOING MORSE CODE STARTED ON THE MORSE CODE FOR ABOUT A FORTNIGHT THEN SOMEBODY SAID THIS LOT HAVEN'T HAD A COLOTI THEY'D BETTER HAVE IT MOST OF THEM PASSED BUT TWO OTHERS AND ME STRONGLY COLOR BLIND SO YOU'RE OUT IF YOU SEND THE WRONG COLORS WHER YOU'RE SIGNALLING IT WOULD BE A DISASTER THAT'S WHEN I WAS TRANSFERRED ONTO MINE SWEEPERS ON THE STEWARDING BRANCH WERE YOU DISAPPOINTED YES NOBODY LIKED BEING ON MINE SWEEPES WE ALL KEPT PUTTING IN FOR TRANSFERR TO SOMETHING MORE GLAMOROUS DESTROYERS SUBMARINES MTBS MG BS U E ALWAYS GOT TURNED DOWN YOU'RE DOING AN IMPORTANT JOB YOU WILL STAY PUT AND THAT WAS IT HMANY PEOPLE ON ONE OF THESE MINE SWEEPERS WHAT WAS THTHE BOAT LIKE FIVE OFFICERS ADABOUT TWELVE FIFTEEN CREW THAT INCLUDES THE ENGINEERS OR THE STOKERS BRANCH STHEY CALLED IT SIGNALING AND AND THOSE DOING THE ACTUAL MNE DETECTING WHEN WE FIRST STARTED WENT OUT MINE SWEEPING IT WAS THREE DAYS ON ONE DAY OFF AND WE HAD TWO STANDING IN THE BOWS WITH RIFLES WHEN THEY SAW A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING BY THEY'D SHOOT AT IT HIT THE HORNS AND BLOW IT UP BUT THAT WAS WHEN THEY STARTED THE MINE SWEEPING CAMPAGN AN TEGERMANS WHEN THEY DROPPED THEM HAD LONG WEIGHTS ON WIRES SO THEY JUST FLOATED O THE SURFACE TO HIT THE SHIP I ONE OF THOSE WIRES CAME LOOSE THE MINE WOULD BOBB ON THE SURFACE ND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOKED FOR EACH TIME WE WENT OUT WHEN THE GERMANS OCCUPIED FRANCE OF COURSE GOT RIGHT ON THE COAST LINE HAD BIG GUNS AT CAP GRENA AND THE USED TO POP AWAY ATUST EVERY TIME WE CAME OUT UTFORTUNATELY WE NEVER GOT HIT THERE WAS ONE AMUSING ANECDOTE COMMODORE HAD BEEN A SENIOR CAPTAIN BEFORE THE WAR AHE RETIRED OF COURSE AD HE WAS BROUGHT BACK IN AND MADE COMMODORE OF THE MNE SWEEPING FLEET HE HAD HIS TWELVE MINE SWEEPERS AND WE USED TO GO OUT AND DO THE SAME THING EVERY DAY GERMANS BEING VERY MARTICULOUS OUT WE'LL SAY FRIDAYS AND TUESDAYS NOT ONLY THE SAME DAY BUT AT THE SAME TIME TO LAY THEIR MINDS AND THEN DASHED BACK IN WE WENT OUT THE FOLLOWING MORNING EACH TIME TO PICK EM UP AND THE SKIPPER GOT A BIT FED UP WITH THUS HE TOLD THE CONFERENCE OF HIS CAPTAINONE DAY THE NEXT TIME WE GO SWEEPING RUN YOUR TROLLS OUT BUT DON'T DROP TYOUR WIRES WHICHS OF COURSE CONTRARY TO ALL NAVAL INSTRUCTIONS HAND YOU COULD HAVE GOT CAUGHT MARSHAL IF ANYHE HAPPENED UT WE WENT THROUGH GERMAN MINEFIELD AS THEY'D LAID IT AND WE GOT AWAY WITH IT SO THE GERMANS CAME OUT AGAIN TO REPLACE THE MINES THEY THOUGHT WE'D PICKED UP AND THEY LOST FOUR OF THEIR OWN BOATS ON THEIR OWN MINES ANDI DON'T THINK THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY SPORTING IS THAT DOCUMENTED COMENTED SOMEWHERE IN THE ADMIRALTY ARKHIVES ANING GOOD IDEA HE COULD HAVE GOT INTO A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR THAT WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN WE WENT OUT I WAS DU TO REPORT WITH SIX OTHER STEWARDS WE REPORTED TO THE FIRST LIEUTENANT ERE DAMAGED CONTROL PARTY IF THE SHIP GOT HIT WE HAD TO CLEAR THE DAMAGE AWAY PUT OUT ANY FIRES AND PULL THE WOUNDED INTO THE WAR ROOM WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS WAITING TO DO WHAT HE COULD BUT FORTUNATELY IT NEVER HAPPENED BUTHAT WAS MY OFFICIAL STATION AND WHAT ABOUT BAD WEATHER AND STORMS AND STUFF DID YOU EVER ENCOUNTER ANY DANGERS WHEN YOU HAD WHAT ANY STORMS BAD WEATHER BIG SEAS WE HAD SOME YES BUT WE STILL WENT OUT YOUR SOUTHWEST AND THAT WAS IT WE HAD SAFETY LINES RIGGED FORE AND AFT SO YOU HOLD ONTO THOSE YOU WOULDN'T GET WASHED OVERBOARD WHAT AOUTDIDWHAT WASIT LIKE WATCHING THE PLANES TAKING GOING OVER YOU AND STUFF DID YOU SEE MUCH ACTIVITY IN THE AIR WE FORTUNATEY W NEVER GOT ATTACKED FROM THE AIR I DON'T THINK THE GERMANS THOUGHT OUR LITTLE BOATS WERE WORTH WASTING A BOMB ON THEY WANTED HIM FOR THE CAPITAL CITIES OR THE AIR FIELDS WERE YOU INVOLVED IN DDAY AT ALL YES NOW A WEEK BEFORE D DAY WAS SHUT DOWN LIKE AN OYSTER NOBODY COULD GO OF YOU KNOW WAS ALLOWED IN FOR SECURITY REASONS OBVIOUSLY YOU COULDN'T GET ANY POST YOU COULDN'T MAKE ANY PHONE CALLS BECAUSE IT WAS COMING UP ALTHOUGH OFFICIALLY WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS BEFORE DDAY ON ADMERALTY INSTRUCTIONS WE'D STARTED NIGHT SWEEPING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DAY SHIFT SO THE GERMANS WERD GETTING USED TO THE IDEA U POPPING ALONG THE COAST DURING THE HOURS OF DARKNESS THEY WOULDN'T THINK ANYY OF IT SO MORNING OF D DAY WE WERET OUT AT MIDNIGHT AND WE WERE SWEEPING RIGHT UP TO THE LINE WHERE THE BATTLESHIPS WERE WAITING TO BOMBARD THE COAST WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE STATIONED AD WE SWEPT THAT MOST CAREFULLY AND THEN AS THEY STARTED COMING UP OUT OF THE DARKNESS FROM TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WAITING AND WE WERE TIRED BEHIND THEM THERE WASN'T ANYTHING ELSE FOR US TO DO WE GOT SENT BACK HERE TO THE ISLE OF SHEVY WHEN THE TROOPS WENT ASHORE ANNOYED BECAUSE WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING AND THEN AEIGHT OR NINE DAYS LATER HE SKIPPER GOT THE ORDERS TO PATROL THE DUTCH COAST ON THE SHET AND PICK UP ALL THE MINES WHICH THE GERMANS HAD SOWN LIBERALLY ROUND THE COAST THERE SO THAT KEPT US BUSY FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS ADWE WERE STATIONED AT A LITTLE TOWN CALLED TERNUZEN A VERY SMALL PORT BUT THERE WAS ALONG JETTE SO WE COULD MORE ALONGSIDE THERE AND ENINGS LATE AFTERNOON YOU GOT SHORE LEAVE UNTIL YOU WERE GOING OFF AGAIN NEXT MORNING AND I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN THE THINGS WE SAW WHEN WE RENT ASHORE THE GERMANS HAD GOT OUT IN A HURRY THEIR SIGNS WERE EVERYWHERE O A HOTEL LOUNGE THAT THERE HAD BEEN IN AN OFFICER'S MESS A THE SIGNS WERE STILL UP AND THEY BLEW SOME OF THE BRIDGES OVER THE CANALS AS THEY LEFT AND THE DUTCH FLOODED SOME OF THE DIKS TO STOP THEIR HEAVY TRAFFIC GETTING AWAY AND I REMEMBER ONCE WE WEREN'T ASHORE CARRIED TA NAVY RAINCOAT DRAPED OVER YOUR ARM FOLDED IN A CERTAIN WAY D THE OFFICER OF WATCH KNEW VERY WELL WE HAD THINGS IN THER POCKETS CIGARETTES PACKEDGE OF BISCUITS ATILLOF JAM OR WHATEVER WHS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TAKENG OFF THE SHIP AWE WERE GIVING IT TO THE DUTCH CIVILIANS BECAUSE THEY WERE AS STARVED AS HELL ND LOOKED VERY ILL DON THIS OCCASION WE GOT ASHORE I SAW A VERY THIN AGG LOOKING WOMAN COMING UP THE STREET PUSHING BATTERED PRAM ANDSE GOT TWO LITTLE KIDS IN THERE THREE OR A BIT LESS I SUPPOSE ONE BLANKET COVER THEM ND D OFFED MYHATGOOD DAY AND SHE GAVE ME A SMILE SHE COULDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH ANI COULDN'T SPEAK DUTCH BUTI TOOK OUT WHAT I HAD AND I PUT IT IN HER PRAM SHOUDV SEEN THE LOOK ON HER FACE SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS COME TO ICE A WHAT THEY DIDN'T EAT THEY COULD ALWAYS TRADE FOR SOMETHING ELSE HA GONE BACK WITH MORE BUT IT WASN'T TO BE AFTER WE GOT RID OF MOST OF THE MINES DUTCH COAST WE HAD A WEEKS LEAVE DOU WELL OBVIOUSLY WE WEREN'T COMING BACK HERE FOR IT IT WOULD BE ON THE DUTCH COAST AND I HAD A ANOTHER FELLOW WE GOT ONTO MAIN ROAD WHICH WAS THE BRUSSELS ROAD LEADING TO BELGIUM AND THUMBED LIFTS FROM ARMY LOS WHICH ARE ALWAYS GOING UP AND DOWN AND WE GOT INTO ABOUT TH THREE HOURS NO A BIT LESS INTO BROUGE WHICH ONE FWAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITIES I'VE SEEN TWO CATHEDRALS AN OPERA HOUSE AND THE TOWN HALL DHE FOUR SIDES OF THE MAIN SQUARE AD ONE OF THE HOTELS HAD BEEN TAKEN OVER AS A NAPPE THE TROOPS BED AND BREAKFAST SO WE STAYED THERE AD WE ENJOYED OURSELVES HE WHEN WE CAME BACK WE GOT ORDERED BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AWE WERE STILL LOOKING FOR MINES WHICH MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED DETECTION GOING UP AND DOWN BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH URGENCY IN IT ANY MORE AND I DID PUT IN TON TO SIT FOR LEADING STEWARD BUT BEFORE THAT COULD TAKE PLACE MY DISCHARGE PAPERS CAME THROUGH AND THAT WAS I EARLY EARLY NINETEEN FORTY NINETEEN FORTY SIX NINETEE NINETEEN FORTY SIX YES AFTER THE WAR YEH BUT UNLIKE THE ARMY OR THE AIRFORCE WE GOT PLENTY OF NOTICE WHEN IT WAS COMING I KNOW PEOPLE IN THE AIRFORCE AND THEY WERE GIVEN THREE DAYS NOTICE AND THEY WERE OUT IN THE NAVY WE HAD TIME TOLD YOU'VE GOT TO BE DEMOBBED IN THREE MONTHS WELL THEY GIVES YOU TIME TO START LOOKING ROUND FOR A CIVILIAN JOB OR SOMEWHERE TO LIVE IF YOU'RE MARRIED WITH KIDS I THINK WE HAD A BETTER DEAL CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS MINE SWEEPING JUST EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WERE DOING WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MINES WELL LOOKED LIKE YARDS FROM THE MAIN MAST STRETCHED OUT EITHER SIDE ABOUT FIFTY FEET AND FROM THESE AR DEPENDING VERY SHARP CUTTING WIRES WITH WEIGHTS ON THE END GO THROUGH THE WATER THE IDEA IS TO YOUR CUTTING WIRES TO CATCH THE MOORING WIRES FOR A MINE AND CUT IT THE MINE COMES TO THE SURFACE AND YOU WOULD DISPOSE OF IT HOW MANY MINES WOULD YOU FIND ON AN AVERAGE DAY ON AVERAGE POSSIBLY A DOSEN POSSIBLY ONLY TWO IT VARIED AND THE DISPOSAL WOULD BE A SHOT WOULD IT THAT'S WHAT IT STILED OF ES THEN THE GERMANS EVENTALY ACCUSTIC MINE WHICH WASN'T MORD IT WAS JUST DROPPED CANNEL WHOPEFULLY IN THE PATH OF ONCOMING SHIPS AND IT EMITTED A MAGNETIC FIELD FROM BATTERIES THAT WERE INSIDE A EVERY SHIP AS IT GOES ALSO MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD AD WHEN THE TWO COLLIDE THE MINE GOES UP SO WE HAD TO HAVE WHAT WAS CALLED DGASING EQUIPMENT A SPECIAL COIL FITTED RIGHT ROUND THE SHIP THE CURRENT IS PASSED THROUGH THAT ANTI CLOCKWISE AND THAT NULLIFIES THE EFFECT OF THE ELECTRONIC FIELD AND YOU COULD GO OVER MINES BALRIGHT COULD YOU FIND THOSE MINES WE FOUND HIM YES T SOMETIMES THE GERMANS GOT CRAFTED AND THEY'D DROPPED SOME OF THESE MINES AT NIGHT FROM LOW FLYING PLANES ANDWE GOT BACK I WASN'T THERE I WAS ON A COUPLE OF DAYS LEAVE AND I WENT HOME TO MAIDSTONE BUT I WAS TOLD OUR SQUADRON CAME BACK FROM PATROL THE LAST SHIP IN SLID INTO ITS PLACE ON THE JETTI AND PROBABLY BLEW UP BECAUSE THERE WAS A MINE UNAND ET'D BEING DROPPED BY A PLANE THE SKIPPER OF THIS LAST BOAT AS IT WAS ONLY SIX FEET FROM THE JETTY I GOT IS DGOUSE EQUIPMENT SWITCHED OFF I THINK THERE WAS TWO SURVIVORS BUT WHO THEY WERE I DON'T KNOW THOW WOULD YOU FIND I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD FIND A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING IN THE WATER YOU CUT IT AND IT FLOATS TO THE TOP HOW DID YOU FIND THESE MAGNETIC MINES WERE THEY ON THE BOTTOM OR ON THE BOTTOM YES HOW WID YOU FIND THAT WELL LIKE A SONAR DEVICE IT PICKS UP RADIATIONS FROM THE MINE AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHERE IT IS A DEPTH CHARGE ON IT YOU SET THE DEPTH CHARGE FOR TWENTY FEET OR THIRTY WHATEVER IT IS AND JUST POTT THEM OVER TE SIDE ON A WIE GUN IN HOLLAND WHEN YOU GOT TO HOLLAND YOU TALKED TO LITTLEBIT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW WERE THERE ANY OTHER MEMORIES OF JUST DEVASTATION WHEN THE GERMANS GOT OUT IN HURRIED THEY TOOK EVERYONE WITH THEM ALIVE OR DEAD AND BLEW A COUPLE OF BRIDGES AND THEN RETREATED TOWARD BELGIUM DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE WINNING THE WAR AT THAT STAGE YES DY HAD COME THE INVASION HAD STARTED AND WE WERE PUSHING IN LAND FROM THE BEACHES WE HADN'T BEEN SHOVED BACK OFF AGAIN AND IT WARE STARTING T BITE WHEN YOU WERE PULLED OUT OF DDAY WEREWERE YOU ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WAS GOING ON ON D DAY AFTER THE BATTLESHIPS HAD ARRIVED YOU COME BACK TO BAYWERE YOU AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR EGUNS GOING ON TEWHEN THE MNBROADSIDE STATED YES I THINK THAT WAS QUARTER TO SIX EIGHT MILES OF SHIPS UP AT THE SAME TIN WE ALREALY GOT INFORMATION FROM THE UNDERGROUND AND RESISTANCE WORKERS WHERE THE GERMAN STRONG POINTS WERE ALL ALONG THE CLIFF TOPS HEAVY GUNN IN PLACEMENTS BUNKERS FOR TROOPS AND SO ON AND THEY GOT CONTINUOUS PLASTERING AND THEY HADN'T QUITE FINISHED IT WAS TWO HOUR BOMBARDMENT HALF AN HOUR
