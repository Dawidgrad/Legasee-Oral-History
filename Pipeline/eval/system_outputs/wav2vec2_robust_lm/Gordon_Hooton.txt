THIS HERE BIG CONBOY I KNEW YOU NEVER SEE IT RAIN LIKE IT GOD ALMIGHTY AND I WAS A LOOK OUT AND TO MATE WITH THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE IN THE LOOK OUT WE WAS BLOODY SOAKED TO THE SKIN PITCH BLACK OF COURSE WE HAD TO PUT ALL NEW AMMUNITION ON A NO FOR WE COULD SAIL FROM THERE CASE OUT WITH THE AMMUNITION BUNKERS DOWN THERE ANYWAY WE GOT UP IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING WE REACHED LIVERPOOL IN THAT AREA AND THEN IT STARTED TO LIGHTEN UP A BIT BUT NEVER LEFT OFF DRIVING RAIN AND WE WENT RIGHT THE WAY UP TO THE NORTH WHERE WE GOT TO PICK THIS COMBO UP AND THEY WERE ALL MORE LESS READY TO SAIL FOR IT WAS THE BIGGEST COMBO OF THE WAR AND EVERY TYPE OF SHIP WAS THERE AND A COURSE WE JOINED HER AND I MEAN I'D NEVER BEEN THE BLOODY SEE YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE BECAUSE WE HADN'T BEEN TRAINED FOR IT IT WAS TOO QUICK BUT ANYWAY BUT WE MANAGED TO ME MADE THE FIRST THING WERE YOU WERE ALL MIXED UP BECAUSE THE SHIP WAS SHIPPING WATER ALL THE WAY UP AND IT I WENT DOWN INTO THE FRONT OF THE SHIP AND IT WAS HALF FULL OF BLOODY WATER AND IT KEPT SWINGING FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER SO IT WAS SHIPPING IT OVER THE TOP YOU SEE IT WAS WORK ONE OF THE WORST STORMS OF THE WAR THAT'S RUNNING UP THAT COAST AND A BUT ANYWAY I I DON'T MIND ADMITTING IT I FELT SO PRETTY SICK GOING UP TO RUSSIA I WANT TO ABOUT GOING UP THROUGH THE CHANNEL AS I SAID BUT WHEN WE ACTUALLY GOT GOING I THOUGHT GOD BLAME I GOT BILLETED BUT HAD THEY HADN'T GOT ROOM FOR US DOWN IN THE THE MAIN PLACE AND I THOUGHT WELL I FELT AS SICK AS A DOG SO I CLEARED MYSELF WENT UP AND THEY GOT THE AFTER GUN TURRET TURNED FORWARD LOOKING FORWARD SO THAT IT WAS OPEN TO THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING ON THE BACK OF THE GUN SHIELD AND IT HAD CURTAINS IT HEAVY CURTAINS THAT GO OVER CAUSE THERE'S NO DOORS OR NOTHING BEHIND AND I SLEPT THERE ALL NIGHT I DID THE REST OF THE NIGHT COURSE I DID FEEL ILL AND MAYBE HE WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE I DO KNOW WHERE HE WENT BUT I WAS NEVER SICK AGAIN WELL I WASN'T SICK THEN I FELT SICK BUT I NEVER LIKE IT AGAIN BUT I'D ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD SWIMMER AND AN ABIDING YOU KNOW AND DIVER I GRUNTED DAVIN BUT SO WHY THAT SHOULD UPSET ME LIKE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW BUT I STOPPED UP THERE UNTIL WE GOT TWO DAYS AWAY FROM I LIKE YOU MIGHT SAY AND I NEVER LOOKED BACK THE SAVAGE WAS A ONE OFF SHIP SHE WASN'T GOT A DEPTH UNDER WATER LIKE THE OLD UP AND DOWN ENGINE ONES SHE HAD SHE HAD ELECTRIC TURBINES STIRS OF STEAM TURBINES MADE ALL THE ELECTRIC BUT SHE DIDN'T DRAW HALF AS MUCH UNDER THE WATER AS AN ORDINARY DESTROYER OR AN ORDINARY SLOOP WHICH WAS PROVED ON THE LAST DAY OF THE WAR OR THE CONVOY AND WE WERE ALL WAITING AROUND OUTSIDE TO GO THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN GAP INTO INTO THE RUSSIAN END AND THAT A NEW BOAT WAS WAITING FOR US AND WE'RE ALL THERE AND THAT THE CONVOY WAS COMING IN YES SOME TO TELL YOU SOMETIMES CONVOY WAS COMING IN AND SPREADING ABOUT BUT THE DOT THE GERMANS WERE WAITING UNDERNEATH THE CLIFF BOTTOMS AND YOU COULD ONLY GO INTO THE DOCKYARD THROUGH AN ENTRANCE NOT MUCH WIDER THAN THAT WITH TWO GREAT PILLARS OF COASTLINE SO YOU HAD A GOOD ONE AT A TIME AND THE BIG LIBERTY SHIPS USED TO SQUEEZE THROUGH IT ANYWAY THIS WAS THE LAST CONVOY OF THE WAR AND WE WERE HANGING ABOUT THERE AS AS THE SHIPS WERE COMING IN WITH STUFF TO SET TAKE IN AND THE STEW BOAT WAS LYING UNDER THE ROCKS AND OPPOSITE US IT WAS SNOWING IN THE MORNING WHEN WE TOOK UP THEIR POSITION TO COVER EM AS THEY COME IN CASE HAD GOT LIBERTY SHIPS WITH EM YOU KNOW WITH RAILWAY ENGINES ON EM AND THAT FROM AMERICA AND THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENED ONE OF EM GOT A TORPEDO AS IT WENT TO GO THROUGH THE OPENING INTO THE HARBOUR WHERE YOU GO UP FURTHER TO IT NOBODY COULD GET THROUGH IT CASE THE SHIP BROKEN OFF AND SUNK IN THE GATEWAY WE CALLED IT A GATEWAY COURSE THAT'S CHAOS THEN BECAUSE THE REST OF THE FLOTILLA IS OF AIR PATELLAR AND THE PEOPLE WE COPY TO BRING UP WERE COMING IN TO THIS BIG OPENING WHERE WE WERE ALL WAITING FOR THE OTHERS TO GO IN AND WE WERE ALL READY FOR EVERYTHING I WHEN ME AND MY MATE WERE PUT DOWN BELOW TO PUSH THE WHAT'S NAMED DEP CHARGES UP OR COME ON AND THEN THEY WERE PULLING THEM UP READY TO GO THE HARDER TO HEARD A TORPEDO COMING OR SO I DIDN'T BUT THE OTHERS ON DECK DID THEY COULD HEAR IT COMING BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WERE AND IT WENT UNDER THE SAVAGE AND IT HIT THE BRAND NEW SHIP JUST AS FAR AWAY AS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD AND EVERYBODY WAS PRETTY KILLED ON IT IT SUNK LIKE THAT BRANNEN BUT WHAT DID IT IT THE SAVAGE SALDRAFT SHALLOW DRAFT YES SHE HAD SHE HAD FLAT ENGINES THAT WERE DRIVEN BY SHAFTS THAT WAY NOT OUT THE BOTTOM AND THEY DROVE THESE TWO GENERATORS I JUST HAD TO GO AND ONE OF MY JOBS I JUST GOT IN EVERY MORNING AND CHECK ALL THE THINGS THAT COULD HAVE STOPPED IT AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WERE RIGHT THAT WAS ONE OF MY JOBS YOU THINK AND I USE TO STAND THERE AND WATCH AS CAUSE WHAT THEY WERE THERE'S NO PROPELLERS AS US AS THEY WERE ON THE BIGGER SHIPS WHICH WERE RIGHT LOW DOWN WEREN'T THEY WHEN WE HAD WITH HER AND IT WAS ONLY DRAWING HALF AS MUCH WATER AS ONE OF THEM AND THAT TORPEDO WENT UNDER US AND IT HIT THE OTHER SHIP THE OTHER SIDE AND WE PICKED SOME OF THE MEN UP SIX WE WE BURIED ONE FOR WE WENT IN A DARK WE WERE FIGHTING TILL DARK OUT THERE ALL THE REST OF THE SHIPS AND YOU SEE WE COULDN'T THIS LIBERTY SHIP THE THEY HIT IT WITH A TORPEDO AND IT BLOCKED THE ENTRANCE YOU SEE THEN IT WENT DOWN IN THE ENTRANCE HOW DID YOU GET RID OF THE MEMBER WELL I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THERE IT WAS UP TO THE RUSSIANS TO DO THEIR OWN WORK ON THAT SO WE WERE FIGHTING UNTIL DARK THAT NIGHT AND IT WAS SNOWING AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING WHEN WE STARTED AND TILL IT GOT DARK AND WE FACT WE BURIED ONE CHAP IT WAS QUITE DUSK GETTING DARK AND WE BURIED HIM AND THEN WE HAD TO GO RIGHT UP NORTH FURTHER TO COME IN ANOTHER WAY FROM THE NORTH AND DOWN INSIDE THE WATER CAUSE WE COULDN'T GET IN YOU SEE IT WAS IT WAS A TERRIBLE IT WAS THE LAST CONVOY THE WAR AND WHEN WE CAME OUT AND THEY'D OPENED IT UP THE RUSSIANS ON ME IT WAS CHRISTMAS THIS WE HAD CHRISTMAS DAY THERE AND WE WERE THERE FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AND WHEN WE COME OUT WE COULD COME OUT THAT WAY AND WE CAME OUT AT MIDNIGHT TWO OF US AND WE HAD TO GO NORTH RUN UP

OUT EMPTIES ALL READY TO COME OUT AND WE WERE SENT EACH WAY US AND THE OTHER ONE TO KEEP ANYTHING DOWN YOU SEE AND TRY AND FIND IF ANYTHING WAS THE WHAT WE WERE DOING AS THE CONVOY CAME OUT IN THE PITCH BLACK AND BY THE TIME IT GOT LIGHT IN THE MORNING THEY WERE WELL AWAY FROM WHERE WE WERE SO WE HAD A SCRATCH UP AND CATCH HER UP YOU SEE WHICH WE DID AND SHE BECAME HOME ALL RIGHT AND NEVER HAD NO PROBLEMS AFTER THE CONVOYS OF THE ARTS IT LET YOU HE DIDN'T STAY ON THE SAVAGE VERY LONG DID YOU WELL I STAYED ON THE ON THE SAVAGE UNTIL THE GERMAN SURRENDER AND WE CAME BACK DOWN TO CHATHAM CHATHAM BARRACKS AND THE DOCKYARD AND I WAS SENT FOR BECAUSE YOU SEE I WAS A VOLUNTEER I JOINED UNDER AGE HENCE IT MADE ME A VOLUNTEER NOT A CONSCRIPTED MAN WE CAME DOWN TO THE CHATHAM DOCKYARD I GOT SENT TO THE PLACE WHERE THE EDIT YOU IN AND OUT AND I HAD TO PACK MY KIT AND THE NEXT MORNING I WAS PUT ON A TRAIN WITH HUNDREDS MORE IN THE DOCKYARD LOCKED IN WITH KEYS AND THEY TAKE EM OUT SO YOU

HAD TO STOP AT THE FORE WE COULD GO THROUGH THE CANAL TO GET OUT TO GET OUT TO THE BOTTOM AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT WAS TIME WE GOT THERE IT WAS PITCH BLACK AND WHEN WENT ON FROM THERE DOWN THE NEXT MORNING THROUGH THE CANAL BUT SHE WAS SUCH A BIG SHIP AND THE NEXT THING WE WENT RIGHT OUT TO SALON AND THAT'S WHERE THEY BUMPED US OFF WAS THERE ANY ANY REMEMBER ANYTHING OF THAT TROOP SHIP I KNOW THERE WASN'T NO BLOODY ROOM FOR US WE HAD TO BE ON THE TOP DECK AND IT WOULD BLOW IN A GALE HAD IT BLEW A RUDDY GALE AND ALL OUR KIT HAD BEEN LEFT DOWN BELOW WHERE IT WAS DUMPED AND I GOT LOADS OF WOMEN ON THERE IN UNIFORM TO THAT AND WE HAD TO SLEEP ON THE OPEN TOP DECK GAIT WAS BLOODY FREEZING IT WAS BUT WE WENT THROUGH THE CANAL AND WENT RIGHT OUT THEN STRAIGHT OUT TO SALON AND THEY DUMPED US STILL PRETTY INCREDIBLE REALLY WHEN YOU THINK YOU KNOW ONE MINUTE YOU'RE IN THE EARLY ONE IN A BAFFLE AND THEN HIS LADY THAT'S ROY AND SO AND SO QUICK AT WERE SHE THEY WERE WAITING FOR TROOPS YOU SEE AND SHE WAS FULL UP SHIP THERE'S TWO ON THEM THEY HAD TWO ON A CAN DID YOU HAVE ANY FEAR OF GOING THROUGH THE FAR EAST NO I DIDN'T WANT IT BELOW DID I I ONLY HAVE MEAN I HAD ANY IT SLOWED IN FEELING WHAT IT MY BELOVED BUT I DIDN'T I NEVER I WANTED IT YOU SEE THAT'S WHY I RUN AWAY AND JOIN THE NAVY YOUNG I WANTED THE NAVY AND WHEN THAT ALL CAME WELL I MEAN I WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD SHE WAS A NICE SHIP BUT I'D NEVER DONE ANY MIND SWEEPING OR NOTHING AND SHE WAS NOT IN THE CHATTER A SHIP YOU SEE BUT EVERYBODY ELSE WE GOT ON LIKE AS A FIRE BUT THERE'S ONE BLOAT AND HE WAS IN THE SAME MESS AS ME HE USED TO SIT OPPOSITE ME AT THE TABLE AND HE I DON'T KNOW WHY HE TOOK A TUCK TO ME BUT ANYWAY HE FOUND OUT THAT I WAS A CHATTER MAN AND THAT WAS WHAT I THINK STARTED I SEE I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE REALLY BUT EVERYBODY ELSE THEY WE WERE LIKE BRICKS TOGETHER BUT WHERE WE USED TO GO DOWN TO SLEEP BELOW IF WE IF WE WANT GOT ANY DANGER WE USED TO OPEN THE LOWER DOWN AND YOU DOWN THERE YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER MESS DECK AND YOU HANG YOUR HAMMOCKS DOWN THERE IF YOU CAN AND HE WAS IN THE SAME MESS WITH ME SITTING OPPOSITE ME AND HE JUST USED TO SNEER AT ME AND I NEVER HAD A BLOODY ENEMY ON THAT SHIP THEY MADE ME CHEAP QUARTER MASTER HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT YOU SEE AND A COURSE THAT GIVE ME QUARTER RUN AS A SHIP AND THEN THE CAPTAIN HE HAD ME UP HIS CABIN AND HAD A CHAT WITH ME AND TOLD ME WHAT HE'D LIKE ME TO DO AND IT IT WAS IT WAS NICE I MEAN I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE STEERAGE WHICH MEANS THAT THE OTHER CHAPS ARE UNDER ME STRAIGHT AWAY BUT I'D NEVER STEER THE BLOODY SHIP BUT I HAD TO AND WHEN IT AIN'T GOT A COMPASS LIKE YOU WHEN YOU SEE THE OLD HANDS GO AT YOU GOT NUMBERS FLICKING BACKWARD AND FORWARD AND YOU ONLY READ EM AND THE BUT WE DID HAVE ONE IN THE OLD ONE WHAT ABOUT THIS SHIP THE JAPANESE SHIP THAT YOU YOU WERE ESCORTED TO ABOUT A YES WELL THAT WAS THE BIGGEST OF THEIR CREWS I CAN'T SINK IN AND DON'T ASK ME THE NAME I CAN'T TELL YOU BUT IT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE THEY HAD AT THAT ALAN SHE HAD BEEN BOMBED AND SHE LAY IN THE HARBOUR WE USED TO GOOD BY HER EVERY TIME WE WENT IN AND OUT BUT WE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON THE BOTTOM BUT SHE WASN'T BUT ANYWAY IT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE OF THE JAPANESE SHIPS AND IT HAD BEEN BOMBED AND IT HAD BEEN IN SINGAPORE HARBOUR FOR QUITE SOME TIME SINCE IT WAS IT AND BUT ANYWAY ON ME NOW KNOW THEY WERE MAKING IT READY TO TOW IT AND SINK IT YOU SEE AND WE GOT CHOSE TO DO IT AND WE WERE COMING ON OUR WAY HOME AS IT HAPPENED AND IT WE LEFT SINGAPORE WITH HER AND WITH A TUG WITH HER TO TALK WITH HER ACTUALLY AND HER SHE WAS A MASSIVE SHIP AND SHE'D BEEN EMPTIED IN EVERYTHING AND IT GOT DARK AND WE'RE COMING UP THE MALACCA STRAITS AND WE GOT TO THIS POINT WHERE WE SHE'S POSED A BEEN SUNK THE DEEPEST WATER CAUSE SHE WAS THE BIGGEST ONE THEY HAD AT THE TIME AND CONSEQUENTLY IT WERE PITCH BLACK AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY COMING TO COME HOME YOU SEE IT COME TO MIDNIGHT AND A TWO TWO JAPANESE TUGS WERE TOWING HE HAD BEEN TOWING A ROD OUT ON AIR WHILE AS FAR AWAY FROM US FURTHER THAN THAT THE BIG HOUSE THEY WERE FROM US BUT THEY WERE COMING UP AGAIN THE COAST LINE AND WE WERE FURTHER OUT WHERE WE COULD KEEP OUR EYE ON EVERYTHING AND AS I SAY IT GOT PITCH BLACK AND BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE POINT WHICH WE HAD A COMPASS READING WE GOT A SINKER ON THEY STARTED THE SHIP COMING UP AND LEFT HER THEY BOLTED AND LEFT THE SHIP WE'RE NO HEADWAY AND SHE'D COME HALFWAY UP NEARLY TO WHERE SHE POSED HAD BEEN SUNK AND I EXPECT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE AIR CAPTAIN GOT PERMISSION TO SINK HER BUT IT WAS MIDNIGHT PITCH BLACK AND WE HAD AIR SEARCH LOT ON HER AND THEY VANISHED INTO THE BLACK AND GONE OF COURSE SHE'S DRIFTED BUT SHE WOULDN'T DRIFT FURTHER BECAUSE I MEAN SHE'S A MASSIVE SHIP BUT SHE WAS ONLY JUST OFF THE COAST LINE AS WE THOUGHT PITCH BLACK AND I'M STILL ON THE BLOODY WHEEL I AM OF COURSE LOOKING AT THE WHEEL AS WHILE CAUSE WE WEREN'T GOING WE WERE JUST HOVERING AND WE I SUPPOSE THE CAPTAIN GOT IN TOUCH WITH THEIR PEOPLE AND THEY SAID WHAT TO DO SO WE HAD TO SEND MEN OVER WITH DEP CHARGES CAUSE WE CARRIED DEPTH CHARGES AND THEY GOT TO PUT THE DEP CHARGES AT A LOW AS POSSIBLE IN THE SHIP CAUSE THERE'S NOBODY ON THERE AND I MEAN IT WERE MASSIVE AND THEY'D GOT TO WAR EVERYTHING UP AND ALL WE COULD DO WAS USE THEIR DEPTH CHARGES AND HER AND TRY EM THAT'S THAT WAS ALL WE COULD DO WELL WE DID WE DID IT AT MIDNIGHT WHEN WE STARTED AND WE WERE DRIFTING AS FAR AWAY PERHAPS AS DISPERSED ELSE FROM HER AND HER COURSE HE COULDN'T DO MUCH REALLY CAUSE HER HER MOTOR BOAT WENT OVER AND THEY TOOK I THINK THEY PUT FOUR DEPTH CHARGES IN HER IN THE MOTOR BOAT AND THAT'S ALL SHE OLD YOU SEE CARRY AND SO THEY TOOK THEM OVER FROM OFF OF US A RARE CREW YOU SEE DOING IT AND WHATEVER THEY DONE THEY WENT ABOARD THE SHIP AND THEY TOOK THESE DEPTH CHARGES AS THE CAPTAIN HAD SAID IT GOT TO BE DONE AND PUT EM RIGHT DOWN IN THE LOWER END AS THEY COULD GET TO THE SHIP CAUSE I MEAN SHE WAS A BLOODY MASSIVE SEEING AND HE DID EVIDENT THEY COULD AND POSED EVERYTHING BUT WOULD EXPLODE AND CAME BACK TO US AND BANG SHE DID SHE WENT DOWN AND BLEW THE BOTTOM OUT AND SHE WENT DOWN OF COURSE WE NEVER SEE IN NO MORE CAUSE WE LEFT HER THERE WHETHER SHE SHE WASN'T TOO FAR OFF THE COAST AND SHE WASN'T TWO FOR HER FROM PENANG THE SHIP WASN'T WE WERE GOING UP TOWARDS PENANG AND DID YOU SEE HER GOING THAT OH YES WE WATCHED OR WITH THEIR SEARCH LIGHT YEAH A SPECIAL THING TO SEE YE WELL WE ONLY ON TILL WE SEE A MORE OR LESS THE THE MAST WAS STICKING OUT I SING THAT'S ALL BUT SHE'S STILL GOING SHE WAS STILL GOING DOWN SHE SHE PITCHED HER MEN PUT DEPTH CHARGES ALL THE WAY ALONG SO WHEN SHE GOT TO A CERTAIN DEPTH THEY'D OPENED THE DEPTH OF THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP TO LET THE WATER IN AS YOU DO AND WE HAD TO SIT THERE UNTIL IT FILLED UP AND UNFOLD THIS CHARGE IT WERE BLOODY YOU NEVER SHOT LIKE IT IT WAS FABULOUS BUT COURSE YOU WOULD WANT TO LEAVE THEIR CAMERAS SO JUST TALK A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD MIND SWEET YOU KNOW THE STORY ABOUT WHAT YOU DO HOW YOU DO IT OH WELL THERE'S THERE'S VARIOUS WAYS YOU CAN DO IT YOU CAN DO IT WITH THE WIRES OUT WITH FLOATS ON WATER THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN PUT DEPTHS DOWN PUT EM DOWN TO CERTAIN DEPTHS AND LEAVE EM DOWN THERE WAITING EM DOWN IT DEPENDS WHAT'S GOING TO BE THERE OVER EM AND THAT WHEN YOU COME BACK BUT BASICALLY YOU ONLY DO IT TO CLEAR THE OCEAN IN THE AIR YOU'RE IN AND IF THERE'S BEEN SHIPS COLLIDING WITH EM YOU WE'D GET SUNK OUT WE'D GET SENT OUT THERE TO SWEEP IT DID YOU EVER MEET NEAR MISSES WILLER MINES WELL WE'VE HAD EM COME UP BESIDE US YES I'D TOLD ME TO BUT WHEN YOU'RE ALL JOINED TOGETHER WE GOT GREAT STRONG BOYS YOU'RE IN A FORMATION LIKE THAT AND EACH SIDIBE GOES OUT TO ANOTHER SHIP AND THEN THEY GO OUT TO ANOTHER ONE AND THEN OUT TO THE OTHER THEN YOU GOT SEVEN BUT YOU'RE THE ONE IN THE FRONT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOT PROBABLY MORE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU CAN SOUND THAN THAN THE OTHERS YOU SAY THEY DO THAT SORT OF THING THEY KEEP IMPROVING ON CERTAIN THINGS AND WE MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S HOW YOU SWEEP THAT SWEEP YOU'RE ALL OVER LATCH EACH OTHER ARE YOU AS YOU TO YOU AS YOU GOT WISE HOLDING YOU TOGETHER IN A POSITION OH NO NO IT'S ALL DONE FREE THEY BRING THEY HAVE TO SIT THERE ON EACH SIDE OF YOU AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE AND THEN VICE VERSA FOR THE NEXT TWO AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT THAT'S WHEN YOU DO THAT TYPE OF SWEEP BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS YOU CAN YOU CAN SWEEP AND SO WE USED TO DO SWAPS SWEEPS WITH THE LONG WARS WE HAD A GREAT BIG THING ON AIR QUARTERDECK AND IT WAS FULL OF HEAVY WIRE AND WE USED TO LET THAT OUT WITH THINGS ON THAT YOU KNOW AND A CAPTAIN ON THE BRIDGE I SAY LET GO AND THEN YOU STOP IT WHEN HE TELLS YOU PRODUCE A MASSIVE SACK STACK OF WIRE ON A DRUM AND IT'S NOT HEAVY WIRE BUT YOU PUT ANYTHING ON THE END OF IT YOU SEE AND YOU CAN LET IT OUT IF IT WILL EXPLODE MINES OR YOU'LL FIND IT IF THERE'S ANY THERE YOU'LL KNOW WHERE YOU STAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER IF YOU IT'S ALL DONE ON LUCK REALLY BUT YOU CAN'T LOOK DOWN IN THE SEA BUT WE USED TO SNAG UP AND WE SNAGGED UP ON AN AEROPLANE DOWN THERE THAT CRASHED AND SO WE WERE TOLD IT WERE I DON'T KNOW I NEVER SEEN IT BUT WE KNOW WHEN IT SNAGGED IT AND I GOT ROUND A SHIP BUT IT WAS A PLANE BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY KNEW OF COURSE WE DIDN'T STOP BUT YOU AS GOT SOMEBODY THAT MADE SOMETHING UP DIDN'T YOU YOU MENTION THIS ABOUT THIS CHAP THEN YOU KNOW THIS CHASE A NEW THE POMPEY RAISING WHEN YOU SAY HE MADE LIFE DIFFICULT WHAT WHAT DO YOU MEAN HOW DID HE DO THAT AS WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WE COME HOME TO ENGLAND AND I HAD THE OR MOST OF THE TIME AND BECAUSE I USED TO GO UP AND SIT WITH HIM IN AN OLD TAKE BECAUSE I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM YOU SEE SO SO THEY DIDN'T ALL HAVE A A LONG THING I'LL JUST TAKE IT YOU SEE AND HELP OUT AND ONE NIGHT AS AT DOING THAT I HAD TO BE A QUARTER MASTER WHICH MEANS WHEN WE WERE AT ANCHOR I HAD TO DO A DUTY AT THE BACK OF THE SHIP WHERE THE WHERE THEY COME IN AND OUT OF IT WHEN THEY GO ASHORE AND ONE THING ANOTHER AND ALL THE LOG BOOKS THERE AND EVERYTHING AND I WAS ON DUTY THERE DOING MINE AND WE WERE ALMOST COMING HOME AT THIS POINT AND I GOT A TERRIBLE THROAT AND COLD AND IT WAS POURING RAIN AND I HAD TO TAKE THE NIGHT WATCH AND I THOUGHT WELL I GOT FEELING COLD AND I HADN'T TOOK ME OILSKINS OUT OF MY LOCKER BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN THERE SINCE I PUT THEM IN FOR WE WENT ABROAD I MEAN YOU DIDN'T NEVER HAVE MET AND I THOUGHT GOD I GOT A GOOD END TO GET MY OILSKINS AND OF COURSE I'M STANDING IN IN AN OPENING WHERE YOU CAN GO IN THAT SIN WALK STRAIGHT OUT AND FALL OF THE SHIP THE OTHER SIDE AND AT NO TIME HE 'S AN OFFICER AND A CREW COME ROUND OF SHIPS AND THEY A CHECK FOR THAT YOU'RE BEING LOOKED AFTER IN A WELL AS I WENT DOWN TO GET MY I NIPPED DOWN CAUSE I GOT THE DUTY WATCH TO GET MY OLD SKIN OUT AND I GOT A TERRIBLE COLD AND THIS CHAP SLUNG HIS HAMMOCK RIGHT ACROSS THE TOP OF THE OPENING WHERE I'D HAVE WALKED DOWN THE STEP UNDER TO MEET THE AIR AND HE'S SWINGING ABOUT IN HIS HAMMOCK YOU NOW AND CAUSE IT'S THIS IS ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND NONE BE KNOWN TO ME THE BOAT COME ROUND AND SEEN THAT I WASN'T THERE BUT THAT DIDN'T CATCH NOTHING BUT HE TOLD THE CAPTAIN THAT I HAD BEEN DOWN IN THE LOCKER AND I WAS HAVING A JOB TO GET ME ME A THING OPEN CAUSE IT ALL STOPPED TOGETHER BEING OUT IN THE HEAT OF COURSE WE NEVER WORE HIM YOU SEE THERE AND THE NEXT THING THEY HE DROPPED ME IN IT AND HE WENT AND TOLD THE OFFICER OF THE DAY THAT I WAS GONE DOWN TO SLEEP AND I'M SITTING TRYING TO GET THIS BLOODY THING OPEN AND CAUSE I GOT A LAZY COLD AND HE'D DONE THAT AND THE NEXT THING HE SENT FOR THE OFFICER OF THE DAY HE COME DOWN PUT ME ON A CHARGE I HAD TO MEET THE CAPTAIN AND EVERYTHING AND A CAPTAIN DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL BUT ANYWAY HE TOLD ME TO FORGET EVERYTHING HE SAYS YOU'RE MY YOU'RE MY MAN HE SAID NEVER MIND ABOUT HIM HE SAID WE'VE HAD TROUBLE WITH HIM BEFORE I BROUGHT THE SHIP HOME RIGHT THE WAY UP TO THE DOCKYARD DOWN SOUTH AND THE NEXT DAY I COME HOME HAD THREE DAYS LEAVE AND THEN HAD TO GO BACK DOWN TO CHAT ME AGAIN AND THEY SAT ACROSS THE DE MOBI WERE ALL FINISHED YOU SEE BUT THEN AND I AIN'T GOING TO BLOOD THEY NEVER GIVE ME A BODY DE MOB SOUP AND NOTHING SO I WENT TO THE AT T SEE WHAT WERE HAPPENING AND THEY SAID OH YOU'RE GOING UP TO SCOTLAND THERE'S A SHIP UP THERE YOU'RE GOING ON SO I SAID OH YOU AM I GOING TO GET THEY SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT AS TWO OTHER CHAPS COMING UP WITH YOU YOU'LL ALL BE GONE TOGETHER AND THAT WAS THAT THAT BIG SHIP UP THERE AND HER BUT CAUSE SHE WAS THE ONLY ON LOAN TO THE DOING A WAR YOU SEE TO US LIKE SHE'S CANADIAN AND SHE WAS GOING TO GO HOME AND I WAS BILLETED ON HER FOR THEY PUT US ON THERE TO SLEEP AND EVERYTHING AND FEED BUT WERE QUITE A FEW OF US AND WE WE SLEPT ON BOARD AND EVERYTHING BUT BY THE TIME THAT THEY WANTED TO TAKE HER HOME TO CANADA THEY SENT FOR ME AND I WENT TO THE OFFICE AND I GOT OUT A BIT OF A PROBLEM AND I HAD TO SEE THE DOCTOR AND THE BLOODY DOCTOR SAID I WASN'T
