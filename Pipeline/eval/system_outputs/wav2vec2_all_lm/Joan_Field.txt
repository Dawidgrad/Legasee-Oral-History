I SERVED FROM NINETEEN FORTY ONE TO NINETEEN FORTY FIVE ERM BASICALLY WESTERN APPROACHES THAT INCLUDES PLYMOUTH RIGHT THE WAY UP RIGHT THE WAY UP TO SCOTLAND ON TOP OF SCOTLAND AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME ON FIELD I WAS JON ROSE OK ONE WHERE ARE YOU FROM AND WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO YOU WELL I ACTUALLY WAS BORN IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE A LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED MELDRIT NOW I THINK IT WAS FIFTEENTH CENTURY THATCHED COTTAGE WHICH MY GRANDMOTHER'S SMALL HOLDING I WAS BORN THERE MY PARENTS WORKED ON A SMALL HOLDING IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR WE MOVED TO THE NEW TOWN OF WELLING GARDEN CITY WHERE MY FATHER THEN GOT EMPLOYMENT AND I LIVED THERE AND WENT TO SCHOOL THERE ON A SCHOLARSHIP ANNIVERSARY TO SHERWOOD HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS IN WELLING A CITY AND I MATRICULATED AT WHICH WAS THEN IT WAS CALLED THE MATRICULATION I WAS THEN SEVENTEEN AND I WANTED TO JOIN THE WAR HAD BROKEN OUT BY THEN OBVIOUSLY I WANTED TO JOIN THE WRENS I WENT DOWN AND THOUGHT WELL I HOPE HOPEFULLY GET IN THE WRENS IF NOT I'LL HAVE TO GO INTO THE WAFT BUT THEY ACCEPTED ME INTO THE WRENS ERM AT THE TIME THEY WERE ONLY TAKING ON COOKS AND STEWARDS WHICH OF COURSE I DID NOT WANT TO DO I HAD AN EYE TEST THEY DECIDED I GOT PERFECT EYESIGHT THEN AND SO I WAS TOLD I WAS GOING TO BE A SIGNAL I DIDN'T MEAN MUCH TO ME BUT I DIDN'T MIND WHAT IT WAS AND I WAS CALLED UP JUST A MONTH BEFORE CHRISTMAS TO HMS CABLE WHICH IS UP IN WARRINGTON WHAT YEAR WAS THAT I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK NINETY I THINK IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MIDDLE OF NINETEEN FORTY ONE AND I THOUGHT IT'S MARVELLOUS ALL THE OFFICERS AT CHRISTMAS WERE WAITING OR SO I THOUGHT THIS IS A LOVELY IDEA THIS IS BECAUSE I WAS SHORT LIVED IT WAS VERY TOUGH AT CABALAERM YOU WERE GIVEN TWO WEEKS WHAT THEY CALL PROBATION AND YOU WERE GIVEN ALL THE DIRTY JOBS TO DO ALL SCRUBBING THE FLOORS CLEANING THE LOOS IT WAS MAKE OR BREAK TIME REALLY SQUAD DRILLING UNTIL SQUAD RILL HATED SQUAD ROLL BUT I GOT TO LOVE IT ACTUALLY AFTER THAT BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY ERM AND AT THE END OF THE FORTNIGHT ERM WE WERE ACCEPTED SOME OF THEM WENT HOME SOME OF THEM WENT A WAR IF YOU WENT A WALL THEN YOU JUST WENT INTO MUNITIONS OR WHATEVER BUT IF YOU DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT PERHAPS THE WAFT WOULD HAVE HAD YOU WE WERE FIRST CHOICE IN THOSE DAYS EVERYBODY WANTED TO GO IN THE WRENS AND SO I STARTED MY VISUAL SIGNALLING AND CODING I DID SOME CODING AS WELL BUT BASICALLY VISUAL SIGNALLING AND THE COURSE LASTED I THINK FOR SIX MONTHS YES IT WAS IT ABOUT SIX MONTHS FOUR MONTHS FOUR MONTHS FOUR MONTHS I THINK AND AT THAT TIME AFTER THAT TIME YOU WENT ON LEAVE YOU WERE THEN DRAFTED TO DIFFERENT PLACES WE ARE OR PUT DOWN FOR PLYMOUTH ALL WANTED TO COME SOUTH CAUSE I LIVED THEN I WENT IN GORDON CITY OBVIOUSLY SO IT WAS SOUTH I WANTED I ENDED UP IN OBAN I NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT I HAD TO FIND IT ON THE MAP WHEN I GOT THE DRAFT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE IT WAS FOUND IT AND I THOUGHT THIS IS LOVELY THAT WOULD BE LOVELY UP THERE CAN I JUST JUST GOING BACK A LITTLE BIT YOU SOUND YOU WERE EMPHATIC THAT YOU WANTED TO JOIN THE WRENS OR ANY OTHER SERVICE WHY I DON'T KNOW I GOT NO NAVAL MY FATHER AND MY GRANDFATHER ALL SERVED IN THE ARMY I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS I LOVE TO SEA ERM MAYBE THE UNIFORM IT'S A BIG YOU KNOW I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE IN THE WRENS IT WAS JUST SOMETHING I THINK STEPNEY HAD THE SAME WHEN YOU READ HER BOOK ERM IS AN ATTRACTION TO IT ERM I SUPPOSE IN A WAY IT'S A SORT OF GLAMOUR OF THE WREN NOW YOU MENTIONED CABAL AND YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW SHIP VISUALIZATION AND CODING BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE LEARNING AND HOW YOU LEARN VISUALIZATION AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THE PROCESS WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU GOT TO LEARN THE MORSE CODE ERM YOU KNOW EVEN AT SEVENTEEN THAT'S A BIT TRICKY BUT STILL YOU LEARNED THE MORSE CODE AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY DRUMMED INTO THE MORSE CODE ERM IS IT PURELY REPETITION YES REALLY AND TRULY AND YOU LEARN GIMMICKS TO LEARN IT YOU KNOW DAD IT YOU KNOW FOR FACE YOU KNOW YOU WERE DOING ALL THESE SORT OF GIMMICKY THINGS TO REMIND YOU ERM IS TOUGH WE WERE PUT INTO CLASSES AND THE VISUAL SIGNALS CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH A V AND MY CLASS WAS VERITY AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT STEPS CLASS IS WHICH YOU JUST MENTIONED IN THE BOOK THE WIRELESS TELEGRAPHERS CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH LIKE WAR SPITE AND THE CODING CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH A SEA I MEAN AND EACH COURT COURSE WAS A DIFFERENT LENGTHS AND WE LEARNED MORSE CODE SEMAPHORE TO SIGNAL WITH FLAGS YOU KNOW LIKE THE OLD NELSON SIGNAL WHICH KEPT CHANGING LEARNING THE PHONETIC ALPHABET WHICH HALFWAY THROUGH OUR COURSE CHANGED SO THAT THE AMERICANS COULD UNDERSTAND IT WHICH ANNOYED US WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO CHANGE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS ANYWAY SO THE PHONETIC ALPHABET ERM EVERY CLASS WAS MANNED BY AN X SERVING MAN USUALLY A CHIEF WHO'D NEVER DEALT WITH WOMEN BEFORE AND SOME OF THEM WERE A BIT TOUGH A BIT TOUGH BUT WE NEEDED IT BECAUSE WE WERE COMPLETELY RAW TO IT OR WE HAD WE WERE TAUGHT NAVAL DISCIPLINE AND DIFFERENT TIME WATCHES YOU KNOW A TWENTY FOUR HOUR CLOCK WHICH OF COURSE WE HADN'T STARTED TO USE THEN THE BASICS REALLY BASICS AND I FOUND IT QUITE ENJOYABLE IT WAS JUST LIKE BEING AT SCHOOL REALLY AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR RENNER WHERE WERE YOU SAYING WHAT WAS PRETTY SPARTAN BUT NOT TOO BAD IT WAS OLD NISSEN HUTS I THINK THEY'D BEEN USED BY THEM I THINK MENTION DEFINITELY MENTIONED IT IN HER BOOK I THINK THEY'D BEEN USED BY THE POST OFFICE BUT THEY WERE ALL OLD NISSEN HUTS ON THIS BIG SITE AT NEWTON FIELD JUST OUTSIDE WARRINGTON AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOW BEING DEVELOPED INTO A BIG HOUSING IT BUT IT WAS A VERY LARGE CAMP ERM MOSTLY THE WRENNERY BUT THEY WERE ALSO THE MEN ON BOARD AS WELL THEY WERE LEARNING I THINK THEY WERE DOING BUT WE WERE OBVIOUSLY BEING TRAINED TO TAKE OVER SOME OF THE SIGNAL STATIONS FROM THE MEN TO RELEASE THEM WHICH WE LEARNT AFTERWARDS OBVIOUSLY SO I GOT MY DRAFT UP TO OPEN AND WHEN YOU GET A DRAFT ERM WHAT YOU KNOW HOW IS YOUR COMMUNICATION YOUR PARENTS AND THIS DRAFT YOU SAY O BAM MIND ME WHERE IS THAT HOW DID YOU GET THERE WHAT DID YOUR PARENTS THINK WELL I WAS A BIT STAGGERED MY MOTHER MY FATHER YES MY FATHER TOOK ME UP TO EUSTON STATION ERM I GOT THIS DRAFT JUST A THING REPORT TO THE ERM I SUPPOSE IT WAS A SORT WE WERE PATROL POLICE UP IN EUSTON THEN I WAS SENT ON TO ERM WHEN I GO FROM KING WENT TO KING'S CROSS AND HAD TO GO TO EUSTON ERM ALL OR LESS MILITARY STUFF ALL IN SIVS ONLY ALLOWED TO TAKE A SUITCASE OF CLOTHES ONE ONE OUTFIT OF CIV CLOTHES AND THEN YOU KNOW THE USUAL PAJAMAS ALWAYS PAJAMAS ERM YOU KNOW THE USUAL SORT OF THING IS YOU WERE GOING INTO HOSPITAL BUT ONLY ONE SET OF CIVIC CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND TO REPORT TO THIS PLACE IN ONE OF THE STATION I THINK IT WAS KING'S CROSS AND THEY TOOK ME UNDER THEIR WING AND SORTED ME OUT AND GOT ME ONTO THE TRAIN MY FATHER SAW ME OFF AND THAT WAS REALLY ALL THAT HAPPENED I ENDED UP I THOUGHT WHEREVER AM I GOING YOU KNOW YOU GO MILES AND MILES BECAUSE ALL THE ERM THERE WERE QUITE A FEW SAILORS ON GOING UP TO DIFFERENT GOING BACK ON LEAVE AND THEY WERE ALL KIND TO ME THEY ALL REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THE TRAIN WAS CROWDED AND I CAN REMEMBER WE COULDN'T SIT DOWN ANYWHERE AND ONE OF THE SAILORS PUT ME UP ONTO THE TOP OF THE RACK AT THE TOP SO I COULD HAVE A SLEEP I CAN ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT WE GOT TO CARLISLE THERE WAS AN AIR RAID WARNING AND WE HAD TO STAY IN CARLISLE SIDING FOR ABOUT AN HOUR WHICH MEANT THAT I HAD MISSED MY TRAIN FROM CARLISLE TO STERLING WHERE I HAD TO CHANGE AGAIN SO THAT WAS ANOTHER PROBLEM I GOT TO STERLING AND OF COURSE THE TRAIN TO OBAN HAD GONE SO I WAS STRANDED EM THE V S PUT ME UP IN A HOSPITAL FOR THE NIGHT AND I WENT DOWN TO OBAN REPORTED TO OBAN TO THE ERM OFFICER IN CHARGE AT OBAN AND WAS TOLD I WAS GOING TO REPAIR SIGNAL STATION IN THE MORNING GOING TO THE SIGNAL STATION IN THE MEANTIME OF COURSE I'D BEEN KITTED UP AT CABLE WE WERE KITTED UP BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BELL BOTTOMS IS ESSENTIAL FOR A VS WREN BECAUSE IT'S SO COLD SO I WAS ISSUED WITH BELL BOTTOMS AND THE NEXT DAY WENT ON DUTY YOU KNOW AND I THOUGHT THIS IS CRAZY ALL THIS SORT OF BUSINESS AT CABLE ALL THE STRICT DISCIPLINE NAVAL DISCIPLINE NOBODY SEEMED TO BE BOTHERED OF BUT I DON'T THINK YOU THINK THAT THEY REALIZED THERE WAS A WAR ON EXCEPT OF COURSE THE CONVOYS COMING IN I LIKED LIKED IT I LIKE SCOTLAND STEPNEY DIDN'T LIKE IT IF YOU'RE READ IN HER BOOK IF YOU EVER READ IT SHE JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO MIX IN VERY WELL WITH SCOTTISH PEOPLE BUT I HAD GOT A SCOTTISH GRANDFATHER PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT I DID SORT OF ACCEPT IT MORE AND I REALIZED THAT YOU KNOW THEY ARE A BIT INSULAR AND THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO BE OFF PUTTING BUT THEY WERE OF COURSE HE IS AN INSULAR LAND UP IN THE HIGHLANDS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THE HIGHLANDS VERY WELL THERE ARE A THING TO THEMSELVES OK WELL SO JUST DO ME A FAVOUR THEN JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE BASE WAS LIKE WHAT YOUR SURROUNDINGS LIKE WHERE YOU SLEPT AND THIS IS OPEN AN OPEN YET AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE WORK YES WELL FIRST OF ALL I WAS STATIONED IN WHAT WAS CALLED THE STATION HOTEL AND THE SIGNAL STATION ON THE PEER WAS ONLY A SHORT WALK AWAY AND I MET UP WITH A GIRL WHO WAS GOING TO WORK WITH ME SHE'D BEEN THERE ABOUT A WEEK WE HADN'T YET STARTED REALLY GETTING THE CONVOYS IN SO WE WERE TOLD WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THAT THE CONVOY WOULD COME IN AND THEY'D BE IN THE BAY AND WE HAD TO AND THE MAN THE MAN ALL THE TIME AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO ON ANY BOATS AND THAT'S ANOTHER THE STORY ERM WE HAD TO MONITOR EVERYTHING COMING IN AND OUT WE ALSO HAD TO LOOK AFTER FUNNILY ENOUGH THE M R F HAD THEIR SUNDERLAND AND CATALINA UP THERE AND THEY HAD A CALL SIGN WHICH CHANGED EVERY HOUR AND HALF OF THEM COULD NEVER EVER READ IT SO WE USED TO HAVE TO READ THEIR SIGNAL FOR THEM TO SEND THEIR PATROL BOLD OUT BUT THAT WAS UNBEKNOWN TO OUR BASE WHO NEVER HAD A CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON IT WAS A CRAZY SET UP REALLY AND THE SUBMARINES ON PATROL DUTY USED TO COME IN ALONGSIDE THE PEER AND WE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THEM THEIR SIGNALS THEY WERE IMAGE OUT ON PATROL THAT WAS MOSTLY WHAT WE WERE DOING AT THE PIER SIGNAL STATION BUT THIS WASN'T ADEQUATE ENOUGH AND GAVAN SIGNAL STATION WHICH WAS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER FROM WHERE WE WERE WAS STILL MANNED BY THE MEN AND THEY ALSO HAD A NEW ASDICCENTRE OPENING UP JUST BELOW WHICH WAS RADAR AND STICK IT WAS STILL DONE BY THE MEN AND THE MEN WERE GOING FROM GAGNON AND THEY WERE GOING OVER TO LISMORE THE WRENS WEREN'T ALLOWED OUT THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS NO IT WAS COMPLETELY ALONE OUT THERE YOU KNOW THERE WAS NO INHABITATION WAS A FEW A FEW SHEEP FARMERS SO THE WRENS WEREN'T ALLOWED OUT IN LISMORE AND THAT'S WHERE THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN HADN'T BEEN KNOWN TO ANYBODY ERM SO THE GANG EVEN SIGNAL STATION WAS GOING TO OPEN UP AND WE WERE GOING TO GO THERE WHICH MEANT VERY GREAT DIFFICULTY BECAUSE FROM THE STATION HOTEL TO GABON IT WAS ABOUT A COUPLE OF THREE MILES TWO OR THREE MILES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT'S NO JOKE SO EVENTUALLY I WAS THERE FOR ABOUT PER SIGNAL STATION FOR ABOUT I WOULD SAY ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE GOVAN WAS OPEN GANNON SIGNAL STATION WAS THEN OPENED UP FOR THE WRENS AND WE TOOK OVER FROM THE MEN WE HAD AN INTAKE THEN OF MORE VS WRENS SO THERE WERE NOW SIX OF US INSTEAD OF FOUR AND WE TOOK OVER GANEVAN FROM THE MEN VERY VERY SPARTAN WHEN WE WERE AT THE PEER SIGNAL STATION WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE MEALS WITH IN THE MESS PROPER MEALS WHEN WE WERE ON A NIGHT WATCH THEY WOULD DO US UP NICE SANDWICHES WHEN WE MOVED FROM PIER SIGNAL STATION TO THE GANEVIN SIGNAL STATION WE WERE STATIONED AT A PLACE CALLED ROSEY LODGE WHICH WAS VERY TOUGH GOING THEY DIDN'T LIKE WATCH KEEPERS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T HANDLE US NEARLY ALL NEARLY WHOLE OF THE WRENNERY WAS WRITERS OR WT OPERATORS WHO WORKED PROPER WATCH HOURS THEY WERE NINE TILL FIVE NOT US WE HAD YOU KNOW WE HAD TO DO WATCH KEEPING HOURS SAME AS THE NAVY SO IF YOU WERE LUCKY YOU GET A HOT DINNER IF YOU DIDN'T YOU JUST HAD A SAD IN SANDWICH SO THE FOOD WAS PRETTY SPARSE IF YOU READ IN THE BOOK PEOPLE MY FRIENDS WHO READ THE BOOK SAY WHY DID YOU STAND IT I SAID BUT THERE WAS A WAR ON WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY DIFFERENT WE HAD TO GO DO IT WAS OUR JOB THE MEN IT WAS IT WAS A VERY VERY SPARSE SIGNAL STATION ERM ALL YOU WANT ME TO DESCRIBE IT TO THE SIGNAL STATION ITSELF WAS RIGHT ON THE TOP OF OF GAVAN ON JUST BY DONLEY HOUSE WHICH IS THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND LADY OF DOLL I THINK THEY WERE CAUGHT YES MCDOODAL AND IT WAS ON THEIR LAND AND IT HAD BEEN BUILT AS A LOOKOUT POST I THINK ORIGINALLY FOR THE COAST GUARDS IT WAS A VERY SPARSE IT WAS A TWO TIER PLACE YOU HAD TO REACH IT BUT TO GET TO IT IT WAS A CLIMB UP A CLIFF ALMOST A SHEER CLIFF THE ROAD WENT BELOW US AND THE SHEER CLIFF UP WHICH WE HAD TO CARRY THE OLDEST LAMP BATTERIES WHICH WAS VERY HEAVY AND THEN WE HAD TO HAVE A COAL FIRE BECAUSE WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO BURN ANY CONFIDENTIAL BOOKS WHICH WE HAD IF ANYTHING IF WE HAD ANY KIND OF AN INVASION WE HAD TO PUT THE BOOKS GOODNESS KNOWS HOW BECAUSE THEY WERE LEAD LINE THEY WERE STATE FROM BUT WE THAT WHILE WE HAD THE FIRE WE HAD A BUNK DOWN BELOW A SIGNAL UP THE TOP AND THE BALCONY ALL AROUND WE HAD A BIG TEN INCH THREE AUDIS LAMPS AN ART AN ART SET AND IT WAS REALLY JUST GO YOU KNOW THAT WAS IT WE JUST PUSHED IT AT THE DEEP END AND HOW FAR COULD YOU SEE FROM THERE I MEAN WHAT WAS YOUR COULD SEE LITERALLY WHERE SHE GOT IT WE COULD SEE RIGHT WE COULD SEE MALE RIGHT THE WAY DOWN TO MULL OVER TO LISMORE WELL WE HAD A PERFECT VISION ERM OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS COMING AND GOING WHY WAS THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT STRETCH OF COASTLINE IN TERMS OF THE CONVOYS IN YOUR BECAUSE IT WAS VERY SAFE ERM THOUGHT ERM THEY COULD COME IN IT WAS YOU COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE MAP IT WAS A COMPLETE BAY AND TOBERMORREY THE ESCORT SHIPS USUALLY ABOUT TWO OR THREE DESTROYERS WOULD DROP THE CONVOY OFF AND GO UP TO TOBERMORREY THEY WOULD GO UP THE SOUND OF MULL IF YOU COULD VISUALIZE THAT COASTLINE MULL ALMOST PROTECTS THE BAY SO ANY SHIPS PASSING HAVE TO GO ROUND BEHIND THE MALL THEY DON'T REALIZE YOU KNOW IS COMING IN THAT'S ANOTHER STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK ERM I THINK IT WAS A VERY SAFE HAVEN ERM THEY THEY CAME IN THEY WERE ESCORTED OFF FROM US PROBABLY DOWN TO GIRLS WOULD GO INTO THE CLYDE FOR UNLOADING OR THEY WOULD MASS UP READY TO GO OUT EITHER ETA OF ARRIVAL OR AN EXPECTED TIME OF DISPATCH THEY WERE EITHER COMING OR GOING AND WHAT WAS THE MOST SHIPS YOU THINK YOU EVER SAW THEM I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE HARBOUR WOULD BE FULL I WOULD SAY THIRTY MORE THAN THAT YES THIRTY MOST LIKELY AND OF COURSE YOU HAD YOU HAVE A LIST AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW YOU THINK THEY MIGHT BE A STRAGGLER BUT THEY WEREN'T THEY NEVER CAME YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THAT WAS THE TERRIBLE THING YOU THINK I WONDERED WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ONE WE HAD QUITE A LOT OF LOSSES UNFORTUNATELY NOT NOT IN THE BAY BUT YOU KNOW COMING AND GOING YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE THE BECAUSE WE HAVE WE HAVE A LIST SENT TO US WHICH WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL LIST AND EXPECTED TIME OF ARRIVAL AND YOU'D GIVE THEM ABOUT TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT NEVER CAME YOU KNOW YOU JUST WONDER WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WERE ALL MANNED BY ERM MOSTLY MERCHANT MERCHANT MEN SO THEIR MORSE WASN'T VERY GOOD BUT NOW AND AGAIN YOU GET A SHIP WHICH HAD A FEW NAMES THE UNITED STATES WHEN AMERICA CAME IN IT WAS BETTER PLANNED YOU KNOW THE LIBERTY SHIPS CAME THEN AND THEY WERE BETTER MANNED THEY WERE ERM A LITTLE BIT OVERPOWERING REALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO SHALL I SAY THIS OVER CLEVER THEY USED TO SEND MORE AT THE RATE OF KNOTS THINKING THAT WE COULDN'T ANSWER IT AND THEN WE WOULD SEND BACK AT THE SAME RATE THIS IS WHY WE DIDN'T LIKE THE AMERICANS VERY MUCH I'M AFRAID THEY TRIED ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY TRIED TO COME UP UP TO OUR SIGNAL STATION AND WE COULDN'T HAVE THEM IN WERE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM IN WE HAD ONE OR TWO PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE COMING UP ONE SHALL I GO ON ONE NIGHT ERM I COULD HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE THING AND A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW THIS VOICE I DIDN'T UNDER WHO IT WAS IT WAS A MAN'S VOICE WE ALREADY HAD A WREN MURDERED IN VERRE VS WREN MURDERED IN VERARI ON A NIGHT WATCH SO WE WERE ALL VERY WARM BY WHICH AN INTER WE ALL WERE TAUGHT HOW TO HANDLE A PISTOL WE HAD TO GO ON THE RANGE WHICH WAS THE RAF HAD A RANGE AND WE WERE TAKEN ONTO THE RANGE BY AN INSTRUCTOR AND TALK TO FIRE PISTOL AND I AM VERY SMALL RISKS AND I WAS TAUGHT TO FIRE HOLDING MY WRIST SO I COULD FIRE WITH MY WRIST WE ALSO HAD A RIFLE UP IN THE SIGNAL STATION IT WASN'T LOADED THERE WAS NO AMMUNITION IN IT BUT THE PISTOLS WERE AT THAT BUT THIS RIFLE WASN'T LOADED IT WAS JUST THERE AS A WARNING I HEARD THIS FOOTSTEPS THIS IS PERFECTLY TRUE I HEARD THIS FOOTSTEPS COMING UP AND I SAID TO MY OP I DON'T LIKE THIS VERY MUCH SO THIS KEPT KNOCKING ON THE DOOR IN THE END I CAUGHT THIS RIFLE AND I THOUGHT NO I CAN'T I KNEW IT WAS UNLOADED AND I THOUGHT NO WHAT AM I GOING TO DO SO I PUT IT UP THE OTHER WAY AND AS THIS VOICE CAME THROUGH THE THING I LIFTED IT UP AND I WAS GOING TO CLOG HIM ON THE HEAD WITH IT HE SAID IT'S ALRIGHT JON IT'S ONLY ME AND IT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNAL MAN FROM DOWN BELOW STUPID WHO'D GOT A DATE I HAD CHANGED WATCHES WITH A GIRL I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TELL HER THIS REALLY HE OBVIOUSLY USED TO COME UP FOR A CUP OF TEA AT THIS TIME AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH HER AND HE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON WATCH AND HE NEARLY GOT HIMSELF KILLED AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE IN MY RIGHTS BECAUSE NOBODY HAD GOT A GREAT BIG PROHIBITIVE NUISANCE UP ON THE DOOR BUT YOU KNOW I NEVER NEVER EVER CAME TO ANYTHING AND I NEVER EVER REPORTED IT BECAUSE I GOT HIM INTO TERRIBLE TROUBLE BUT WE WERE ARMED BUT ONLY WITH A PISTOL AND HAD A RIFLE WITH NO AMMUNITION BECAUSE WE HAD A WREN IN INVERARI WHAT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T KNOW I'M AFRAID ALL THAT IS A NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WE WERE JUST TOLD TO BE VERY AWARE AND IT WOULD TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS AND I THINK STEPNEY MENTIONED THIS IN OUR BOOK AS WELL WE NEVER EVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED WE HAD WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A SPY A MAN USED TO COME DOWN IT WAS ALL PROHIBITED LAND FOR CIVILIANS BUT THIS MAN USED TO COME DOWN SIT ON THE ROCKS WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS AND HE HAD BANOCLAS AND A CAMERA WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CONVOYS WE COULD TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AROUND THE IN AND AROUND THE THING BUT NOT A CONVOY NOT ALLOWED TO AND SO WE REPORTED THIS MAN TO OUR HEADQUARTERS NO SIGNAL BACK IN THE STATION HOTEL NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ABOUT IT SO HE JUST DISAPPEARED NOW WE NEVER EVER HEARD WHETHER IT WAS JUST A LOCAL NEWSPAPER MAN OR WHETHER HE WAS A KIND OF A SPY OR WHETHER HE WAS JUST INTERESTED IN SHIPS WE NEVER HEARD I'M AFRAID IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS ALL NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD AND JUST YOU KNOW JUST PICKING UP ALL THE AMERICANS WHAT YOU WERE SORT OF TALKING ABOUT STORY BECAUSE THE AMERICANS GAVE YOU SOME HASSLE ERM YES WELL THEY WOULD TRYING TO BRIBE US THEY WANTED TO COME UP THE SIGNAL STATION LOOK NOW LOOK HONEY WE'VE GOT SOME NYLONS OR HONEY WE'VE GOT BANANAS ON BOARD YOU KNOW THEY MEAN SO STUPID AND SO CHILDISH WE TOOK A DISLIKE TO THEM WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE WAS THE WAY THEY USED TO TREAT THEIR OFFICERS COMPLETE DISRESPECT THEY WOULD CALL THEM BY THEIR FIRST NAMES WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS TERRIBLE AND THE CAPTAINS AND ALL THE OFFICERS NEVER SEEMED TO TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THEM WE WERE IN URBAN ONE DAY SHOPPING AND THE AMERICANS CAME ON BOARD CAME ON POVERTY SHOPPING AS WELL AND ERM WE HAD TO TAKE US FOR A CUP OF COFFEE OK FINE WHICH THEY DID WE TOOK THEM TO THE YMCA AND WE HAD A CUP OF COFFEE GOING BACK SOME OF THEIR OFFICERS WERE COMING THE OTHER WAY WE WERE APPALLED THE WAY THEY SPOKE NO SALUTING HA HA CAP I THOUGHT THIS IS TERRIBLE I MEAN I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT IT WAS JUST ANOTHER WORLD AWAY AND THEY WERE TRYING TO BRIBE US WITH BANANAS AND NYLONS AND WE JUST DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT TOO WE THOUGHT IT WAS TOO CHILDISH WITH ALL THIS VERY FAST FLASHING MORSE YOU TOUCHED ON THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF ER YOU KNOW COMMUNICATION YOU HAD THE SAME FOR YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LAMPS THERE ALL THE SO JUST WHEN DID YOU USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNICATION IS ONE SPECIFIC TYPE IN IN THE STATION ALWAYS BY MORSE BY LIGHT OR SOMETIMES BY RT ERM NEARLY ALWAYS THE ART WE REALLY ONLY USED FOR THE ASDECK STATION AND MOSTLY THE OLDEST AND ALL THE BIG TEN INCH WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT OF COURSE TO HANDLE YOU HAD TO GO OUT ON THE BOW AND OF COURSE UP THERE THE WINDS WERE ALWAYS AT GALE FORCE AND WE ALWAYS HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOR THE FOR THE WEATHER EVERY DAY WE HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOR THE CONVOYS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER WAS WHAT WERE THE CONES THE CONES WERE THE COME WAS SHAPED LIKE THAT AND YOU HOISTED IT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH WAY NOW UPWARDS FOR UPWARDS FOR THE NORTH WIND AND DOWNWARDS FROM THE SOUTH WIND VERY PRIMITIVE BUT IT GAVE THEM SOME IDEA OF THE WAY THE WIND I MEAN IT ANOTHER THING I MEAN YOU COULD TELL THE WAY THE WIND WAS BLOWING JUST LOOK AT THE END FROM WHICH WE ALWAYS HAD TO FLY THE WHITE NINE AND WE HAD TO BUY BY THE COLOURS OF THE WHITE NSM PUT IT UP AT SUNRISE AND DOWN AT SUNSET SO THE ENRON WAS ALWAYS FLYING SO YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHICH WAY THE WIND WAS BLOWING WITHOUT THE ONE BUT IT WAS A GALE FORCE WIND BUT WE USED TO PUT THE COIN UP WHICH SOMETIMES MEANT THE CONE WAS UP FOR DAYS BECAUSE THE GALES WOULD BLOW UP THERE VERY VERY VERY WINDY AND SOMETIMES WE WOULD HAVE TO BE LASHED ON TO THE TEN INCH BY OUR OP BECAUSE IT WAS SO WINDY YOU KEPT BEING BLOWN AWAY IT WAS IT WAS VERY VERY COLD AND VERY VERY WE WERE ALWAYS WET BUT WE DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER DID YOU HAVE DID YOU HAVE A BATH OR A SHOWER UP THERE WHEN WE WENT BACK TO THE ER HOW LONG WOULD YOU BE SITUATED UP THERE THEN WELL THE NIGHT WATCH WAS A LONG ONE WE'D GO ON SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT O'CLOCK COME OFF AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING THAT WAS A VERY LONG ONE THE OTHER WATCHES WERE PRETTY WELL FOUR HOURS ON AND FOUR HOURS OFF BUT THE NIGHT WATCH IT WAS A TOUGH ONE BUT YOU AND YOU HAD TO WALK THERE AND BACK FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO WALK WE COULDN'T BE OBJECTED BECAUSE THE MAN MEN IN THE STICK STATION DOWN BELOW US GOT TRANSPORT THEY WERE WORKING IN THE SAME WATCHES OH WELL YES OK THEN THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD ISSUE US WITH BICYCLES WHICH THEY DID WE HAD A WREN OFFICER CAME UP TO SEE US AND SHE SAID THIS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND THEN THEY SUPPLIED TRANSPORT FOR US SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK THE NIGHT WATCH BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS THREE OR FOUR MILES IN THE PITCH DARK ALONG ALL THE COAST ROAD BUT FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO BEFORE THEY REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING THAT'S AMAZING A STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK YES THE DUKE OF YORK WE NEVER HAD THE VERY BIG SHIPS THE BIGGEST SHIP ESCORT SHIP THAT EVER REALLY CAME INTO US WERE DESTROYERS OR OR CORVETTES BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS USED TO GO INTO MALL TO WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS TO GO BACK OUT SO WE NEVER REALLY HAD ANYTHING WHAT I WOULD CALL VERY LARGE I WAS ON WATCH WITH STEPNEY ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION AND IF YOU CAN PICTURE THE ISLANDS AND THE SEA AND SOME OF THEM YOU SEE A GREAT BIG CROSS ANCHOR CROSS MAST COMING AT THINKING WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE AND WE HAD NO ETA FOR ANYTHING WE HAD NOTHING WHATEVER IS IN WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY YOU KNOW IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT OF COURSE WE CALLED IT UP NO REPLY OF COURSE THAT WAS WORRYING NO REPLY BECAUSE IT WAS A SPECIAL EVERY HOUR IT CHANGED THE CALL UP SIGN CHANGED ON A CODE BOOK SO YOU WOULD CALL THEM UP BY THE CODE WHICH IT WAS FOR THE DAY AND NO REPLY SO WE HAD A LITTLE SHIP WE HAD TWO SHIPS ACTUALLY ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN STAR ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN WAVE AND THEY WERE PATROL SHIPS WHICH USED TO PATROL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AMONG THE CONVOYS ALL THE TIME THEY WERE OLD WHAT I WOULD CALL SOMETHING LIKE A CORVETTE I THINK THEY WERE OLD TRAWLERS BUT THEY WERE MANNED BY NAVY AND THEY WERE IF ANY TROUBLE WE CALL THEM UP IMMEDIATELY AND THEN WE CALLED UP THE SOUTHERN STAR SHE WAS WAY OUT OVER A MILE AND ASKED HER WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHE SAID I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING FROM HERE BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE IN A WAY WAY BUT SHE SAID I'LL GO AND INVESTIGATE SHE SAID IF IT'S ANYTHING TROUBLE I'LL PUT A SHOT ACROSS ITS BOWELS THAT WAS THAT ANYWAY THIS THING GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER EVENTUALLY I MANAGED TO CALL UP OBVIOUSLY THE BUNTING TOSSER THAT'S WHAT VISUAL SIGNALS ARE CALLED BUNTING TOSSER WAS ASLEEP I SHOULD THINK HE THOUGHT WE WERE ONLY CRUISING AROUND THESE ISLANDS AND HE CAME BACK QUICKLY WITH D OF INSTEAD OF A PENNANT NUMBER BECAUSE ALL SHIPS HAVE PANIC NUMBERS EITHER THE PENNANT NUMBER OF THE SHIP OR THE COLD WE CAME BACK WITH NOTHING QUICKLY OF WHY AND I SAID TO STEPNEY OF WHY DUKE OF YORK SAID GOSH IT'S A BATTLESHIP I SAID BASE DON'T KNOW SO WE QUICKLY PHONED OUR BASE AND THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE US BECAUSE NOBODY HAD GOT ON ETA ANYWAY THE CAPTAIN OF THE OUR CAPTAIN THE BASE CAME RUSHING DOWN TOOK HIM ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO GET TO US BY WHICH TIME SHE WAS IN FULL VIEW MASS IT JUST FILLED UP THE WHOLE OF THE BAY I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT AND OF COURSE IT WAS A GREAT BIG HOAR ABOUT THIS WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW OF COURSE SHE WAS ON SHE WAS ON PILGRIMAGE UP TO NORWAY AFTER THE MASHANHOST AND SHE WAS DOING THIS TO I SUPPOSE SHE THOUGHT OH WE'VE GOT TIME TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DID IT THEY WERE WAY OFF COURSE I MEAN IT NOTHING EVER SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN THE IT WAS A VERY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS OUT THERE BUT SHE DID SHE CAME RIGHT PAST US SAILING JUST OFF MULL I MEAN I COULD SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE SHE WAS IT WAS THEN THAT SHE JUST APPEARED BEHIND THE ISLAND AS IF IT WAS ON SOME KIND OF A FILM IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND IT WAS SORT OF THING YOU DREAM ABOUT LOVELY STORY LOVELY STORY BUT NOBODY EVER REALLY AGAIN YOU NEED TO KNOW WE NEVER REALLY FOUND OUT WE REALISED AFTERWARDS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHE WAS ON HER WAY UP TO THE BATTLE IN YOUR WAY DRINK OF TEA PLEASE E D DAY YES WE D DAY CAME WE HAD ALL THE SHIPS WE HAD WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT WHY THEY LOOKED SO DREADFUL THEY WERE ALL SORT OF BATTERED SHIPS WE THOUGHT WE HAD SEEN SOME AWFUL SIGHTS BUT THERE WERE ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY OF THEM I SHOULD THINK WITH TWO DESTROYERS DURBAN AND SOMETHING ELSE ONE WAS THE DURBAN SOMETHING MAYBE I'VE WRITTEN MAYBE SHE MENTIONED THEM IN THE BOOK ANYWAY AND WE THOUGHT GOD DESTROYER DOESN'T THINK HE WAS A TERRIBLE STATE SURELY THE NAVY KNOW THEY WERE WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE THEY CAME IN I SUPPOSE THEY WERE IN ABOUT A WEEK OR MORE THAN THAT TEN DAYS ENOUGH TIME FOR STEPNEY TO GET TO KNOW THIS SIGNAL AND THEY SAID WE MUST BE TEN DAYS ERM WE STILL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WERE IN SUCH AND WHY THEY DIDN'T BECAUSE THEY ONLY EVER STAYED FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS BUT THEY SEEMED TO BE A LONG TIME AND WE THOUGHT HELLO SOMETHING SOMETHING'S GOING ON THEN ALL OUR WE WERE TOLD WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO POST ANY MORE LETTERS ALL OUR LETTERS WERE TO BE CANCELED ALL OUR POSTAGE OUT WAS TO BE CANCELLED EVERYTHING GOING OUT FROM THE BASE WAS TO BE STOPPED AND WE ALL LEAVE WAS STOPPED AND WE THOUGHT SOMETHING'S IN THE AIR YOU KNOW YOU GET THAT FEELING WE THOUGHT WELL WHERE ARE THEY GOING WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO OF COURSE THEY WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS ERM ONE NIGHT BEFORE D DAY THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT OR SO THEY SET ERM THE NIGHT BEFORE WE ALL SEEMED TO BE GETTING READY THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG SHIP CAME ALONGSIDE SOME OF THEM AND TOOK OFF A LOT OF STUFF WE THOUGHT THEY DON'T USUALLY UNLOAD HERE IT GOES TO GO AND GREENOCK WHERE THEY WERE UNLOADING ALL SORTS OF STUFF WE WATCHED THEM THROUGH THE TELESCOPE YOU KNOW CHAIRS AND TABLES AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS WERE COMING UP WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS NO NO NEXT DAY WHEN WE CAME UP ON WATCH THEY WERE ALL BUSY GETTING READY TO GO OUT AND WE HAD NO EXPECTED TIME OF DEPARTURE AT ALL THEY ALL JUST SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR OUR TWO PATROL SHIPS HAD NO IDEA THEY SAID WHAT DO WE DO WHEN THEY'RE GOING WHAT WE HAD WE COULDN'T TELL THEM OF COURSE IT WAS SO SECRET AND THAT'S THE END OF THE DAY THAT WAS ALL THE BLOCK SHIPS GOING DOWN THEY WERE ALL ROTTEN OLD SHIPS THAT NOBODY WANTED THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD BEEN SO BATTLE SCARRED THAT THEY WERE ALMOST UNSINKABLE IN SO THEY WERE THE TWO BIG BLOCK SHIPS AND THESE WERE SENT JOHN TO HELP OUT AND WE NEVER EVER HEARD UNTIL THE END OF THE WAR WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT THESE OBVIOUSLY THERE WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS THING YOU TOUCHED ON EARLIER BUT I'D LIKE MORE CLARIFICATION ON IS THE CONVOYS ESSENTIALLY YOU DID TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTATION SO CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN AGAIN FOR ME YOU KNOW HOW THE PROCESS A DISPATCH RIDER WOULD ARRIVE FROM BASE FOR THE STATION HOTEL WHICH IS THEIR BASE THATCH RIDER WOULD ARRIVE WITH A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH WOULD CONTAIN ETA OF THE NEXT CONVOY COMING IN AND RIGHT SO YOU THEN GET IT OUT PUT IT IN FRONT OF YOU PUT IT UP AND WAIT FOR THE FIRST ONE LITERALLY TO COME IN E T NINE HUNDRED YOU KNOW PERHAPS THEY WOULDN'T START TO COME INTO NINE THREE HUNDRED THEY'D OBVIOUSLY BEEN MARK I SUPPOSE I THINK FROM IRELAND THEY WERE THEN SORT OF MARKED ACROSS THEY WOULD GET THE ETA OF THEM COMING ACROSS THAT WAS LITERALLY HOW WE GOT THE TAS FROM A DISPATCH RIDER CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WOULD COME ERM I SUPPOSE THEY ARE ABOUT EVERY THE CONVOYS WERE COMING IN QUITE REGULARLY AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH COMING IN BY THE TIME THEY'D GONE OUT AGAIN THE BAY WAS ALWAYS REALLY ALWAYS CHOCKABLOCK THEN OF COURSE YOU ALSO GOT THE RAF BOATS GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AT SUNDERLAND AND THE CATALINA SO IT WAS QUITE A BUSY LITTLE HARBOUR AND EVERY SINGLE THING HAD TO BE LOGGED AND LOGGED OUT IDENTIFIED AND PUT DOWN YOU KNOW IT SO YOU HAD TO BE ON WATCH PRETTY WELL AWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON ALL AROUND YOU LITERALLY IN THE AIR OVER THE CATALINA THIS IS WHY WE HAD TO HAVE SOUTHERN WAVE IN SOUTHERN STAR WHO USED TO BE OUT THEY WERE ALSO SIGNALLING AND TRYING TO GET THEM IT WAS REALLY LIKE A GREAT BIG HERD OF SHEEP AND TWO SHEPHERDS TRYING TO CREPT THEM IN AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN ORGANISED CHAOS BUT IT WASN'T IT WAS VERY VERY GOOD IT ALWAYS WORKED IT WAS JUST REALLY SHEPHERDING THESE SHIPS YOU KNOW THESE BIG LIBERTY SHIPS THEY WERE QUITE BIG DID EACH LIBERTY SHIP HAVE ITS OWN SORT OF COOL SIGN THAT YOU WOULD EACH YES EACH WE KNEW THAT WE KNEW EACH ONE WAS WE HAD AN IDENTIFICATION FOR EACH ONE SO WE COULD MARK THEM OFF IF NOT WE GOT THERE EVERYONE'S NAME IF SOMEONE WERE VERY LONG BUT YES WE HAD AN IDENTIFICATION ALL OF THEM YOU HAD TO CONCENTRATE QUITE HARD WHEN THEY WERE COMING IN YOU COULDN'T EXTENSION WANDERER BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO BE SO QUICK YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THEM NOT COMING IN HOW DID YOU HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'VE DONE FIVE CONVOYS AND YOU'RE MISSING TWENTY BOATS WELL WHAT WAS THE FEELING WELL FIRST OF ALL WELL IT FIRST HAPPENED YOU WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE I HOPE THEY'RE ALRIGHT BUT BY THE TIME YOU'VE DONE IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR OR SO YOU JUST ACCEPT IT YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU DO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED AGAIN YOU GOT THIS YOU NEED TO KNOW WE USED TO TRY AND FIND OUT WE WERE NEVER EVER TOLD THE THREE OF THEM PROBABLY BEEN SUNK OFF SOMEWHERE AND YOU SEE I WONDER HOW FAR THEY GOT AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MEN YOU KNOW BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THAT LOVELY STUFF THAT WAS COMING IN OR GOING OUT I DON'T
