so you've headed on to sing a pool what can you remember of them and it was there any anticipation about what you were you re facing no you get well i remember we we've seen past a seen past singapore town and up into the up into the dockyard ah i've i've actually been back and i've actually got photographs i've got a photograph somewhere that the prince of wales tied up in the navy dockyard in singapore and when i organized one of the first groups of prisoners wore back as a tour guide and we got back and we went into the dockyard and i got a photograph of exactly the same position that the prince of wales was in so you had from singapore down to malay is that right am well we were the prince was there was a report came in from the army that there was a japanese invasion up around the era of code baru which is the north the north of mali and as as the report was that there was a japanese invasion fleet there they dispatched the prince wales and repulse to get in amongst them and sort him out but it was a complete trap because the japanese had had accumulated god knows how many a twin engine bombers insigone and of course as we got up in towards a canton and that of malaya we were well within their range and of course as soon as soon as we got in their range the japanese went for us and they were they were coming at us a at about ten twelve a aircraft at a time five at one side and five at the other side so it didn't matter which way you turned you you steered the ship you were running into their torpedoes and the first torpedo of the japanese hit the prins wales on the port after and it was the we had four propellers two on each side and they the the torpedo hit the ship just forward of the into inner a propeller and he bentley bent the shaft a twelve inch diameter shaft the explosion bent the shaft and it ripped the back end of the prince wales open and of course we went down we went down to an angle of about a fifteen degrees straight away with the amount of water that flooded in there i think i think some of the the um boffins of that reckoned that there was about ten thousand gallons of water hit the flooded the prince wales in about thirty seconds well of course a in view of the fact that we were that badly damaged and that we were starting to sing they gave the order to abandon ship and the sergeant who was in charge of our gun orders on to the folks the front of the ship counted us out and found that he got the whole of the romain crew and then ordered us to jump or to abandon ship rather and i can i i can recall there was a rope there and i went down the rope so far caught my foot in me the portholes on the side of the ship and just sort of gave myself a push and let go and dropped and i it's been calculated it was seventy feet from the from the time i let go of the rope to the water i told people to day that i won't even jump in the bath it's too deep but then we swam the navy have two or three different types of a rescue and one of them is what they call a carly float which is a great big what ten ten feet in those days it was ten feet a square mat with floats placed every about a foot away from it for me cala as a rescue float i know i got got on to hang on to the side of that we with a load of other chaps we pushed it and that towards the destroyer and climbed up aboard the destroyer and which was one of our three escort destroyers and after that we would take her back to singapore what was it like to be you know that i mean you talked before about being hit by a shell you didn't feel it did you did you instantly know were you in your gunnery position did you instantly know that this was a major hit well yes because of the angle that the angle that she she developed a although i was in as i say in the in the transfer room a below deck a immediately i mean the a and the shape and that of the room i mean was such that you knew it was over and the sergeant in charge of the gunnery is as they ordered us aboard to evacuate and abandon ship what was it like when you re in the water i mean where could you see all these japs basing around oh no no the japs the japs knew that they got us and they they they in fact one flight did come over and they signaled to the destroyer i can remember this piece a distinct the the japanese signal to the destroyer to cease fire and pick up survivors and this was told over the tannoy of the of the destroyer that that and the case japan the our own destroyer was picking up survivors and we were taken back to singapore which destroyer was it a i'm not sure whether it was the destroyer express or the destroyer electra there was the express the electra and the tenadus these three destroyers the ten
