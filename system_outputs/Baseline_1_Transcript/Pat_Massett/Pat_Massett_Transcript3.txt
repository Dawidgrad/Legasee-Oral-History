you said he hated the the location but was it job you know just to talk a bit about some of the camaraderi the girls all that was that that was really very very good they were they were very good everybody was together everybody was happy in that part of the country the lancashire people were very very good we'd go out of an evening going to dances we had to be in by about ten o'clock we were late every night every night we're allowed out and the people were very very friendly they would invite you back to the house for a meal and everything it it was really good it was really good and the people on camp were very good there were men there as well i think it was a place not only for v s friends but for all the coders as well so there are a lot of men and ladies as well so that made it good for dancing and different things yes yes when did you after you been in in lancashire where did you go next i went to the isle of white after that i was allowed a fortnights leave and then a while i was home for the fortnight i did write or i did phone i don't i'm not sure a one to say that i would like to go abroad i would like to go overseas and to be you had to volunteer to go overseas but um i did get went up when i got back and afterwards i got a letter to say that i wasn't accepted to go overseas but i was going to the all of it so there was that little bit of water in between the earth over the solent sea the as on so will you when you managed to get over seas to the isle of white what wade where are you based and tell me a bit about the the the the ren base the in white where you were we bet we were based at cows alive white and dan we were next and that we were we were in the sort of little houses different people were in little houses and things like that in coos and where i work was in a big a big complex of a room a bit it wasn't exactly a hotel but different flats of a new complex of flats and we were sort of right on top they built a special special awning for us to be right on top so that we could be outside or inside and then took to be able to to conduct the ships out out in the roads cows roads there i'm right beside us with the yacht club and we used to go and and that used to be our mess the yacht club we used to have all our meals in the york club were always very very well fed always well fed yes yes and am we're right there and it was we were but when did you go there i went there narntins hurting an nineteen forty one i was there in nineteen forty one i think it was about fifteen months i was in the isle of white before i was discharged so it was really there for all the build up of the day land ins that's what it was actually or there that's what it was actually for all the ships and has to say it was just naval ships we never saw and done now what the same ships were coming in soon and they were more or less coming in to to to to berth in in the coach roads before they went and may be over to france or up to southampton or whatever yes a lot of them were coming in to to go up to southampton yes were you adept at spotting ships the a i was in one way yes but we had to we had to and we had to signal to every ship and get officially their number or their name i'm trying to think whether they i think they gave their name to say who they were they all had numbers that they never had names during the war on the ships they only had a number but they will always give their names we had to know their name and where they were going at the time on thru curse and did you never get any that idea was tom that caused alarm no we never had any never have any no it was a bit of a problem at night we would am i would second them and ask who they were and very often the signal or might have gone to sleep or something like that and we had a big fourteen inch light and then we had to put that on i had to use that to try and wake them up and find out they were but we all we had to get special permission to use this huge big light i used to live to not use to show up everywhere this big light going across the water it was it was good but we had to find out who over but it was worse when we had the fog when the fog came down you'd hear the rattle as the as they came in and they uncured and you could hear the rattle as the anchor would hit the water but it was just fog we used to get a lot of fog there and we never knew who they were or anything but it never cause any problem never they seemed to come in and know where they had to to go and and that was it yes
