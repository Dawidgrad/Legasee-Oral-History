THE INJURED AND WE'RE TOLD SEVERAL TIMES THAT IF THE FIGHTING GETS ANY WORSE AND IT'S TERRIFIC NOW YOU'LL BE OVER THERE JOINING THEM WHETHER WHETHER FULLY TRAINED OR NOT SO UNFORTUNATELY THE FIGHTING

WE DID SAILING LEARNT TO SAIL LEARNT TO ALL THE KNOTS AND EVERYTHING IN GANGES SO ANYWAY AND BETWEEN THAT WHEN WHEN I HAD FINISHED MY TELEGRAPHIC COURSE AND AN THEY SAID TO ME WELL WE'RE NOT SURE WE

THE FRONT THERE FLAG WAVING AND THE GERMAN SHOOTING AT THE FLYING WAVE BUT NOW I'M NO HERO I'LL COME HERE TO DO A JOB I'M NOT HERE ROSA ANYWAY SO I FINISHED UP AS A RADAR OPERATOR AND THERE WAS TWO

RAID OR CONTROL GUNNERY SO I DID THAT CAUTION FROM THERE I WENT DOWN TO AN A CHATHAM WHICH WAS MY BASE ANYWAY AT A CHATHAM WRITING AND WAITED THERE FOR A SHIP WELL YOU WON'T FOR THE SHIP ALL YOU DO IS WALK ABOUT THE BARRACKS HAVE JOBS LIKE PAINTING COLD WHITE OR SWEEPING UP ALL DIFFERENT PLACES AND YOU GO DOWN EVERY EVENING IN YOUR OWN TIME TO WHAT I BELIEVE IS CALLED THE OLD BAR BIG BARN AND THEY HAVE LISTS OF THEM PEOPLE TO GO AND DRAUGHT IN FOR A SHIP WAS THE FISH WHEN I CAME ACROSS AFTER GOING DOWN THERE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS I HAD MY NAME ON THERE'S QUITE A LOT IN THIS DRAUGHT SO WE HAD TO GO FOR SOME REASON TO HAVE A MEDICAL EVERYBODY HAD TO PASS THROUGH MEDICAL THAT WAS ON THAT DRAUGHT WHERE IT WAS WHAT IT WAS FOR I NEVER TELL YOU I NEVER TELL YOU IN THE NAVY IS KNOWN AS THE SILENT SERVICE NEVER TOLD ANYTHING SO HE MAY I WENT THROUGH THIS MEDICAL EXAMINATION AS IT CAME TO MY TURN TO SEE THE MEDICAL OFFICER HE SAID OUT WELL OUT I STAND OUT ON ONE SIDE WAIT FOR SOME TIME HE CAME ACROSS AND I DO NOT WRONG FELLOW IT I SHOULD YOU GOT GERMAN EASELS WELL MY GOODNESS GERMAN ANGELS AND YOU'RE FIGHTING TEN FOR THEM NOT HAVING BEEN ANY INNER GERMANY IF YOU DON'T BE FUNNY I DOUBT I SPENT A FEW WEEKS AND SIX BAY I'VE GOT NO MEMORY AT ALL WHAT HAPPENED THERE I DON'T THINK ANYTHING COULD HAVE ANIMAL BUT IF YOU'RE GOING ON THE DRAUGHT AND GOING ON THE SHIP OBVIOUSLY TWO HUNDRED MEN UPWARD ON THE SHIP TO APART ON TO A FEW WEEKS TIME SO MY NAME WAS ANOTHER DRAUGHT AND THIS WAS VORACIOUS CARON AND THEN WE WE NOT TOLD WE JUST I AM SO WE GOING ON A DRAUGHT AND YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF OF DRAUGHT SO WHEN THE TIME CAME THERE WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED OF US FROM CHATHAM WE WERE PUT ON A NAVY TRUCK SHOT BACK TRADE WE OVER BACK OVER BACK WE CUPBOARD TRUCK TAKEN DOWN TO THE LONDON STATION I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IT WAS NOW BUT ALL OF US PUT ON A ONE TRYING I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY OTHER CAST ANY OTHER PEOPLE ON THAT TRYING EVERYONE UNDER THE DOOR TO A LOCKED WE WERE LOCKED IN AND YOUNG LAD MODES HARD ON ME SAID NOW WHAT THAT'S FOR DID YES STOP US GETTING OUT NOW IT'S NOW IT STOPPED THE GIRL GOING TO US WHEN WE GET TO STATION I HAD STARTED TO CHAT WE NOT FRIENDLY NONE OF US EVER KNEW EACH OTHER WE COME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE ONLY WAY THAT WAS A LONG TRIP UP TO GLAD TO GO GLASGOW WE STOPPED QUITE A FEW TIMES AND I THINK FOR A AIR RAGE AND FOR NO REASON I BELIEVE WE STOPPED AT CARLYLE UNDONE THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED OF THE CARRIAGES LOVELY CUPS OF TEA AND SAVAGES PASSED ACROSS FROM THE W S OR WHOEVER NOW ANYWAY AFTER LOOK REST ON STARTED TO TRAIN AGAIN AS WE DREW OUT THE STATION I REMEMBERED THERE WAS BIG FACTORY BY THE SIDE OF THE STATION RIGHT ON THE TRACK AN OLD MILL OR SOMETHING OF THAT AND OUT OF THESE WINDOWS THERE WAS BALLOONS AND GOLD WAVING THE BLOOMS WERE NOT SOME OF THE BLOOD DARKENING MEMBER OR THINK THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OF ANOTHER TYPE WE WON'T MENTION BUT ANYWAY THAT WAS NICE WE LOVED AT THE FACT OF BEING CHEERED ON OUR WAY WE EVENTUALLY ARRIVED IN GLASS GO I'M TRYING CHANGE STRAIGHT WAY OVER TO WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN A LOCAL TRAIN THAT TRAIN TOOK US TO GREENWICH A GREAT WAS OUR DESTINATION AND WE WERE THEN PUT INTO AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE WINE SEA A A BIG BUILDING AND WE WERE THEN TOLD THAT WE WOULD DO TO AND HAVE BEEN A SHIP'S COMPANY OF A BRAND NEW SHIP BEING BUILT IN SHIP YARD WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO WIN SAVORY WISELY NOW IT WASN'T READY AND WE COULD GO AND LOOK OVER THE SHIP AT ANY TIME WE LIKED A MASS OF WIRES AND AND PEOPLE WELLED IN AND AND I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT WE DID WE MUST HAVE WALKED ABOUT GREEK ANYWAY IN A FEW WEEKS THE SHIP WAS READY ALL OF WIRES AND BITS AND PIECES OF BEEN REMOVED AND WE ARE GIVEN OUR PLACES OUT ON THE FOREIGN MASTIC WHO POINTED OUT WHERE WE HAD A LOCKER WHERE WE PUT NEW CLOTHES WE WERE IN UNIFORM NOW OF COURSE ALL OUR CIVILIAN CLOTHES HAD GONE SO WE JUST HAD OUR ALL NAVAL CLOTHES THE FIRST OF THINGS WE HAD TO DO GO THROUGH TRIALS THE TRIAL TO TAKEN UP THE CLYDE YOU HAD TO DO THIS SPEED WHATEVER DETERMINED AND A A FEW GUNNERY TALK I TRIALS ANYWAY WHEN WHEN WE FINISHED THE TRIALS AND THE SHIP WITH COMMISSION THEN INTO THE WORLD NAVY AND THAT WAS A TIME WE WAS GONG TO BE OFF NONE OF US WAS EVER WAS TOLD THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO ON A CERTAIN DAY SO IF WE HAPPEN TO BE HAVING SURELY IF WE COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY BUT THEN ONE DARK NIGHT SHORTLY AFTER WE FINISHED OUR TRIALS WE SLIPPED FROM THE DOCK DOCKSIDE THE YOUNG OF THE YARD THE OTHER YARD AND AN EDGED OUR WAY UP THROUGH THE CLIDE NO LIGHTS OF COURSE WE CLOSED ALL TIGHT DOORS ALL SCUTTLES OR THE DEAD LIGHTS AND WE WERE GIVEN OUR POSITIONS THAT WE WERE ON WATCH THEN WE WERE REAL SAILORS AND SO ON I WAS STARBOARD WATCH SO THEREFORE I WOULD BE UP ON THE A HALF AN HOUR ON THE STARBOARD WHAT LOOK OUT WE WE NEVER HAD ANY ACTUAL TRAINING FOR THIS IF WE JUST WERE TOLD TO DO WHAT WE WERE TOLD SO ANYWAY WE EASED OUT OF THE CLYDE YOU HAVE TO GO PAST THE BOOM WHICH LETTER OUT THE TIRED TIRED AND I REMEMBER I CAME OFF WATCH OR HADN'T GONE ON WHAT I CAN'T REMEMBER THIS DAY BUT I'D HAD REASON TO GO TO THE HEDGE WHICH ARE THE TOILETS I'D SIT DOWN JUST SITTING DOWN AND AS AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION HANG AND OR RATTLE PULL ME THROWING UP QUICKLY RUSHED OUT OF THE DOOR INTO THE EMPHATIC THE AND CANTEEN FLAT THAT JUSTIN AND PASSAGE WAY AND BUMPED INTO AND ONE OF THE OTHER SAILORS WHOSE OFFICE FOR IT BEGINS TO ME AS IF WE'D BEEN TALKED OF EVER NOR OUT NOW IT'S ONLY THE TILL PEDEN TRYING A DEPTH CARTED OUT BUT SHAME FACED I DIDN'T GO BACK HE SAID WELL YOU IN A RUT PLACE DENSO WE HAD A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT THAT ANYWAY FROM THERE AND THUS OUT THE DARK NIGHT WHY WAS THE OLD AND THE CLASS IN WHEN YOU LEFT BUT THE DISHES AND THE PROBLEM THAT THE ENEMY I KNEW THAT THEIR SHIPS BEING BUILT NEARLY ALL THE TIME AND THEY WOULD COME OUT OF A DECLINE OR COME OUT OF THE TIME OR CAN PERHAPS COME OUT OF A IRELAND AND IF IF YOU CAN VISUALIZE IRELAND AND SCOTLAND AND THE NARROWS IS REALLY WIDE AS A LONG DISTANCE BEING NARROWS AS AS A CONTINENT AND THEREFORE SHIPS HAVE TO COME IN AND OUT OF THAT AREA OR THIS WAS ALWAYS THE PLACES WHERE YOU'D HAVE TWO OR THREE U BOATS JUST LURKING HOPING FOR A GOOD KILL AND WHETHER THEY EVER FOUND OUT THAT A SHIP FROM ANY BOYS OR ANYTHING WAS COMING OUT AT THAT TIME OF NO IDEA BUT THAT WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS PART AT NONE OF US HAD WORKED TOGETHER WE'D ALL COME OUT OF TRAINING WE'D HAD GOOD TRAINING IN OUR OWN JOBS BUT OF COURSE NOT TO TAN BECAUSE WE WERE NOT WITH THE SAME PEOPLE WHO TRAINING WITH SO FROM THEIR ONWARDS YOU UP FRED HEBRIDES IT WAS REALLY AN TO PUT THE FEW SAILORS THAT HAD EXPERIENCE AND THE OFFICERS OF COURSE YOU WERE EXPERIENCE THAT YOU SHARE THAT HAD TO HAVE ALL THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO DO WHAT YOU WERE DOING COULD YOU GET NO AN ESCA YOUR SHIP COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN WITH SIMPLY FIVE PER CENT OF THE CREW THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TO SEE BEFORE NEVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP BEFORE VERY OFTEN SO IF IF WE'D BEEN ATTACKED AT THAT TIME WE HAD BEEN A SITTING DUCK WHEN WE ARRIVED AT SCAPA FLOW WHICH IS RELATIVELY SAFE WE AM GO THROUGH THE BOOM AGAIN TO GET INTO THE FLOW AND FROM THEN ON WE TO DO OUR TRAINING WHAT A TRAINING AT SCAPA FLOW REALLY IS TO GET YOUR WORKING AS A TEAM THE WHOLE SHIP HAS NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY DO IN A GUN CREW OF FOUR OR FIVE HAD TO OR TO WORK TOGETHER A FOUR IN THE UN A TRANSMITTING STATION WHICH IS THE BONE AND EARTH AND IS LIKE WE WERE AS GUNNERY CONTROL YOU'D HAVE ABOUT TEN PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM WE SHOWN IN CHARGE OF AN ORDINARY AND SITTING ROOM AND ONE EACH ONE OF THOSE HAD A JOB TO DO BECAUSE I HONORED DESTROYER WHICH WE WERE MASCARA A DESTROYER A BRAND NEW RUN AS WELL SO NOBODY WOULD KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND SHALL WE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE FIRE CONTROL TABLE AS IT WAS WHERE YOU EIGHT PEOPLE ON IT AND ALL THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THEY'RE TRAINED ON SOMETHING SWIMMING A TRAINING THEY STILL HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT IF THE SHIP'S ATTACKED OR IF WE HAD TAKEN ANOTHER SHIP SO THAT WAS WHAT WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF US IN THE FLOW AT THAT TIME WE WERE SO SORT OF DESTROYERS IN PARTICULAR AND OTHER ESCORT SHIPS SO NOT ONLY WERE WE STAIN IN AN ICE SAFE AREA TO DO OUR TRAINING WE WERE SENT OUT IN HARNESS AS IT WAS CALLED WITH ANOTHER SHIP THAT MIGHT BE MORE EXPERIENCE BUT THEN THE CAT CAT IS ONLY ONE OF YOU THIS EXPERIENCE AND ONE WHICH IS TRAINING TED US ON WE RE LEARNT IT THE HARD WAY ARE ALL OUR REAL FIGHTING AND WAS AROUND THAT TIME AND AT THE END OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR RICH AS A OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER WAS AROUND THE AREA SO DID SEND US OUT WITH ANOTHER SHIP AND THIS IS IN ONE CASE WE WERE THE ONLY SHIPS THAT IN THE FLOW DESTROYERS AND WE WERE CALLED DUTY DESTROYER A AT ISH BULL ON BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT TIME I WAS A SHIP THAT WE SUNK SO WE WERE SENT OUT WE NOW NOT NO BASIC TRAIN ON THIS WE HAD A CALL TO GO TO A SHIP OFF CAPE WRATH THAT HAD BEEN SUNK WE DIDN'T KNOW OR HAD BEEN TORPEDO LADY ATE OUR MESSAGE WAS NOT THAT I'D BEEN SUNK THAT THE SHIP HAD BEEN TORPEDOED AND TWO DESTROYED HAD TO GO OUT TO TRY AND HELP TO CATCH THE NEW BOAT THAT ONE AND TO PICK UP SURVIVORS IF THERE WERE ANY THERE SO THERE WAS TWO OF US AND IT SEEMED AN FROM THE RECORDS OR LOOKED UP THE OTHER SHIP THAT WENT OUT WITH US WAS ANOTHER SHIP WAS ALSO WORKING OUT OF THIS TWO DESTROYERS WITH ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL AND HAD TO GO OUT TO THE SHIP I FOUND OUT LATER IN LIFE IT WAS AT MISS BULLEN WHICH WAS A ESCORT VESSEL AND THEY HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU BOAT THE VERY NEW BOAT HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR IT ONE OF OUR SHIPS FIRST SO AT MISS BULLION HAD BEEN SUNK AND THE THE OTHER SHIPS THAT WERE WITHER WERE STILL LOOKING FOR THE THE U BOAT WELL IN THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS ONE A SKIPPER WAS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE VERY EXPERIENCED AND HE WENT TO THE POSITION WHETHER YOU BUT WHERE THE U BOAT HAD SUNK TO MISS SOME AS SHE WAS PULLING NOBODY HAS TOLD ANYTHING HE KNEW IT AGE MISCIBLE AND NONE OF US WERE TOLD SO THE FIRST THING YOU DO YOU GO ROUND TO DEPTH CHARGE IN THE WHOLE OF THE AREA IN CASE YOU BOAT IS STILL THERE WHERE WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH TOLD OR AS THE GO OPERATOR THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DOWN THERE WHICH COULD BE TO YOU BOAT SO WE DEPTH CHARGE THAT AREA AND APPARENTLY THE AN ECHO WE GOT DIDN'T MOVE WHICH STAYED THERE SO WE ASSUMED THAT THAT WAS A U BOAT AND HE NEVER NEVER CAME UP NEVER GOT IN THE OIL OR NEVER GOT ANYTHING SO I'M AT THAT TIME OF THE WAR THE AND SNOW COULD ONLY JUST STARTED SO WHICH HELPED THEM OUT ON IN THE WAR NOW THIS YOU BOAT IF IT DIDN'T COME UP WITHIN TWELVE HOURS THEN IT WAS A DEAD DUCK SO WE WAITED AROUND THERE ALL NIGHT WITH A BOARDING PARTY READY TO GO ON TO BOW BUT IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME UP FOR WHERE IF IT HAD ME AND THEN IT SEEMED WE HAD TO GO ON ANOTHER JOB OR DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE OR BUT WE HAD GONE AN ESCORT JOB SO WE STOOD DOWN THE WHOLE TEAM I WAS LOOKING THIS THE NEXT MORNING WE STOOD DOWN THE A TEAM OF THE BOARDING PARTY AND IS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE AND SHIP I HAD NO WORK TO DO IT OFF WATCH AND I COULD SEE IN A NEAR DISTANCE MAGNETIC MIND FLOAT PAST BUT NOBODY SHOT AT IT WHICH WE MIGHT UNUSUALLY JUST IN CASE THERE WAS A NEW BOAT DOWN AND WE KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL THERE WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE ALL NIGHT YOU NEVER STARTED YOUR INDIANS WHICH YOU DON'T WANT THAT U BOAT IF YOU ARE STILL ALIVE THERE DOWN THERE TO KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL UP THERE WAITING TO IN THE END WE AND WENT BACK TO CAPE FLAG AND CARRIED ON WITH OUR AND LEARNING TO FIGHT A WAR TELL ME ABOUT CHRISTMAS CAN WELL AND THAT THIS WAS THIS I TOLD YOU ABOUT WAS THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER OR THEN THE TREMOR DROPS WE MIGHT HAVE DONE THERE I'M NOT SURE BUT THE NEXT IMPORTANT THING THAT I CAN REMEMBER IS THAT WE WERE AND NOT REQUIRED FOR WORK AROUND THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD SO WE WERE BACK IN SCAPA FLOW AND IT WAS QUIET AND WE WERE SAFE BUT NONE OF US IT HAD A CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME BEFORE THIS AND THERE WE ALL WERE IN A DEAD PLACE CAPRA SHAPE FLOWS TERRIBLE PLACE THAT IS ANYTHING AND WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS THIS TWO HUNDRED ON THE SHIP ROUGHLY TO ROME SHIP'S COMPLIMENT AND LUCKILY WE HAVE A FEW AMONGST US AT WERE EXPERIENCED AND THERE WE WERE THE COOKS AND MESS WERE MAKING CHRISTMAS CAKE BY WHATEVER STUFF WE COULD GET HOLD OF YOU ALSO MANAGED TO GET I 'M NOT SURE WHERE FROM A CHRSTMASTREE FOR SOMEWHERE AND THAT I RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE MAST ON THE TOP OF EVERY SHIP AT CHRISTMAS TIME OF THEIR OWN HARBOUR HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE WHICH I RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE SHIP AND ON WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED I THINK BY THE OFFICERS BEING CHRISTMAS BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WE WERE OR NOT AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE DRINK ON BOARD IT A DRAWER SHIP THAT SOME OF THE OLD STAGES HAD SAVED SOMEBODY RUM RATION WHICH ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO BIASES VERY BAD VERY HIGH CHARGE A SHOW COURT BUT THE OFFICERS NORMALLY ON US ON A SMALL SHIP LIKE A DESTROYER CLOSER EYES TO LOTS OF THINGS THAT THEY WON'T BE ALLOWED TO IF THEY WERE ON A BIG SHIP THAT WE CALL A PASSER SHIP SO MANY OF THE LADS THAT WERE ALLOWED RUM I WASN'T BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED UNTIL YOU TWENTY NORTON EIGHTEEN AND BUT OUT CAME TO RUM RUSSIAN HORRIBLE I HATE AND AN ON PEOPLE MADE UP THINGS OUT OF PAPER I THINK I'M A PASTING PAY FOR RED GREEN AND BLUE CAME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES OUT OF HARDY HOLES AND MADE INTO DECORATIONS AND WE WERE MORE AT THE BOY THERE AT THE TIME AND MACHINE CHRISTMAS SONGS AND PUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAD INSTRUMENTS I HAD A SMALL BANG ON BOARD AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE I SUPPOSE THAT CAT SOME OF OUR LADS YOU COME FROM HOMES THAT NEVER HAD IT BAD I THINK A VERY TEARFUL FOR HIM I CAME FROM HER HOME THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY SO CHRISTMAS WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FOR ME TO ANYBODY WE ALL ENJOY OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME AND IN A PLACED ON CUP OF FLOUR IS COATED IN COMMAND OF ROKERSON I WAS AT OUR CAPTAIN AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A LAW FOR HIM REALLY AFTER WE'VE BEEN LIVING FOR A TIME GRIT THOUGH HE WAS VERY STRAIGHT AND HE WAS QUITE HAPPY TO TURN HIS LIFE HE WAS HE WAS A LAD TO SIGN OF US IN LATE ON IN THE STORY WHEN WE GOT UP FOUR EAST AND I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT BUT HE HAD AND MULTIPOLO TEAMS AND HE WAS ON THE TEAM WITH THE LEDGE AGAINST THE OFFICERS AND HIT THAT WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON HE WOULD BE AND HE WAS I THINK BOXING CHAMPION OF THE FLEET OR PART THE FLEET AND YET EVEN SUCH A NICE PERSON YOU KNOW AND THERE IS ANOTHER CASE I'LL TAKE IT TO IN LITAWHEN I'LL GO ASHORE SO AND BUT THE NEXT THING WE WE WENT ON REALLY AFTER CHRISTMAS AFTER CHRISTMAS WAS WHEN WE REALLY STARTED AND LEARNING THAT THERE WAS A WAR ON WE WOULD STILL GO OUT I WOULD STILL GO OUT AS A SHIP WORKING UP TOGETHER BUT THE FIRST ONE I E WE WENT OUT WITH I BELIEVE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND THIS WAS TO BE A STRIKE AGAINST NORWAY WE DIDN'T KNOW TILL WE WERE AT SEA THAT WE WERE DOING THIS BUT THERE WAS THE CRAFT CARRIERS SOME MORE DESTROYERS I THINK AND IN SOME OTHER SHIPS NOW OUR AIR DROP WAS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT THE AND ONE OF THE CARRIERS BUT IT WAS ALSO TO ACT AS A LIFE BOAT REALLY WHAT WHEN THE AIRCRAFT TOOK OFF AND I THINK A CUT OF THESE WITH OLD TYPE AIRCRAFT IN I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE BUT THEY WERE BIPLANES NOW THIS WAS A REALLY ROUGH DAY AND THEY TOOK OFF I WATCHED THEM I WAS IN A MUCH ALL TIME AND NOT I WATCH THEM FROM THE DECK AND THE CARRIER WAS BALANCING UP AND DOWN BUT THEY TOOK OFF AND I THINK THEY CARRIED OUT OR TRY TO CARRY OUT THEIR TASK BUT THE TWO HOUR SHOW COME BACK DIDN'T MAKE IT CAUSE THEY THE SHIP WAS DANCING UP AND DOWN THE ALCOVE CARRIER DANCING UP DOWN AND I BELIEVE ONE OF THEM HIT THE DECK AND WAS PUSHED OVER OLD AT WITH THE PEOPLE IN IT THEY CAN'T TAKE HIM OUT PUSH THEM OVER TO MAKE WAY FOR ANOTHER ONE LANDING AND THE OTHER ONE DISAPPEARED I THINK HE WAS GIVEN ORDERS TO TRY AND FLY BACK TO HIS BASE OR A BASE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH TO LAND ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER WE ARE I THINK BEING CRASH BOAT IT WAS CALLED WE WENT TO TRY AND FIND THE AIRCRAFT AT DITCHED SADLY NO AIRCRAFT SO ANYWAY I THINK THEY HAD TO CALL OFF THE STRIKE COULD SUGGEST TO TOO DANGEROUS TO DO ANY MORE THAN FLYING OR NOT THAT SO THAT WAS REALLY A BAD BEGINNING TO MY WAR A WE WENT BACK TO SCARPA YOU TALK ABOUT BEING RATHER WERE YOU FEELING TERRIBLE I WILL SEASICK MOST TIMES I WENT TO SEE BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ARE WHEN YOU ARE LOOK OUT OR WHEN YOU ARE IN THE T S WHICH IS IN CALM THE T S IS DOWN BELOW AND AND THAT IS THE TRANSMITTED STATION THAT TAKES THE THAT S LIKE A RELAY FROM THE DIRECTOR TOWER WHICH IS RIGHT UP THE TOP OF THE TRIP THROW YOU IN A TOES TO THE MAIN ARMAMENT WHICH IS FOUR FOUR INCH GUNS SO I'M OFFERED THE COMMUNICATION NUMBERS SO THE DIRECTOR WOULD SPEAK TO ME THE OF THE TWO OFFICES IN YOUR DIRECTOR WOULD BE SPEAKING TO ME AND I WOULD BE SPEAKING TO THE GUNS BUT APART FROM THAT I'M THE DIRECTOR WOULD HAD INSTRUMENT THAT WOULD SEND SIGNALS DOWN TO OUR BIG COMPUTER THE ORIGINAL A MECHANICAL COMPUTER AND MECHANICAL COMPUTER WOULD SEND THAT INFORMATION MECHANICALLY TO THE GUNS IN BUT ONCE I GOT INTO A POSITION WHERE HIS EXCITEMENT FORGOT ALL ABOUT SEA SICKNESS I WAS OK SO THAT'S A GOOD THING BUT NORMALLY IF I WASN'T AND ON A MARCH OR STANDING I BE STANDING ON THE UPPER DECK WATCHING TO SEE HE IN UP AND DOWN AND PROBABLY BEING SICK THE ONLY TIME YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS IS WHEN YOUR EXPECTING ACTION YOU KNOW UM LATER ON AND TALK ABOUT THE MINE IN WE WERE AT ACTION STATIONS ALL THE TIME BUT IF YOU'RE DOING A JOB JUST ESCORT IN THEN YOUR AT CRUISING STATIONS AND UNTIL SOME TROUBLE POPS UP IN DEPTH CHARGING YOU BOATS IS NOT A CASE OF GOING TO ACTION STATIONS IS SHOWN IF THE A U BOAT FIGHTS BACK THEN YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS SO ANYWAY AND WE WENT FROM THERE BACK TO SCAPA FLOW AND I THINK WE DID ONE OR TWO JOURNEYS LIKE THIS AND OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND EVENTUALLY AND WE SUPPOSEDLY FINISHED OUR TRAINING OF WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM MIND YOU ALL THIS TIME I'M A TERRE TALKING TO ABOUT NOW WE WERE STILL LEARNING BECAUSE WE WISH TO SELL TEAMING UP WITH PEOPLE THAT WE NEVER WORKED THROUGH BEFORE SO IF WE'D RUN INTO ANY REAL TROUBLE AT THAT TIME WE WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD A LOT OF CHANCE IT WASN'T A LATE ONE WHEN WE AND LEARNT THESE THINGS SO AND THE NEXT ONE I THINK ONE IS AN IMPORTANT ONE IT SAYS IN ABOUT FEBRUARY I BELIEVE WE WERE JUST TOLD WE WERE GOING OUT I THINK THAT NIGHT WE WERE NOT GIVING ANY REAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE WE WERE GOING OR WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO BUT IT WAS A VERY BIG DE THERE WAS A VERY LARGE FORCE AND IT WAS WE LEFT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT I BELIEVE IS DISH IT OUT OF SCAPPER AND THIS IS THIS IS WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE MINE LION AND OPERATION AN IT IT WAS A VERY IT WAS A VERY ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO MOON IT WAS ALL STARLIGHT SO IT WAS VERY GOOD VISIBILITY AND IT WAS A VERY CALM NIGHT STRANGE ENOUGH HARDLY ANY ROUGH SEA OR ANYTHING AND WE SET OUT AND YOU SELDOM KNOW WHO'S WITH YOU YOU IT'S THE SILENT SERVICE YOU HAVE NOT TOLD ANYTHING AND WE'VE BEEN ABOUT OUT ABOUT AN HOUR I BELIEVE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AND THE SKIPPER THEN SAID OVER THE TANNOY WHAT WE WAS GOING TO DO HE'D OPEN HIS ORDERS AND HE TOLD US THAT WE ARE WE WERE A BIG FORCE ONE OF THE LARGE FORCE WERE GOING DOWN THE SHORT SOUTHERN PART OF NORWAY TO EAGERSAND AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY WE WERE JUST ONE OF TWO SHIPS AN LADEN WAS AZALEAS SAME TIME THE SAME DESTROY AS WE WERE AND I AM I AM TASK WHICH WE HAD TO RECORD THIS UN MINI ATOMICIPOLLO A FIRST OF ALL BOTH FORCES WORKING TOGETHER HAD TO PASS THRU A BIG MINE FIELD THAT THERE'S A BIG MINE FIELD THAT LAID A THING BY US A AND DO WE HAD TO GO THROUGH ONE PATH FOR IT WE SHOULD ONLY PASS THROUGH IT BUT WE KNEW WHERE THE OPENING WAS SO IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE ENOUGH WE DO GET LOOSE MINDS SO OUR AZTEC OPERATOR HAD TO AND PICK OUT THE MINES THE MAY AND I WAS ON WATCH AT ONE TIME AND I COULD HEAR SHEARING SAYING AND THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE PORT SIDE AND THE CAPTAIN WOULD MOVE THE SHIP OVER A BIT SO ANYWAY WE GOT THROUGH IN THE MINE FIELD ALL OF US WITH NO REAL PROBLEM AND DONE THEN WE SPLIT UP WE WERE TO WAIT TILL TWELVE O'CLOCK AND AT THAT TIME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE OTHER BIG FALSE WHEN WE WERE BY THE WAY UP THERE TO DE WAGE AT THAT POINT AND THE OTHER BIG FALSE WAS TWO CRUISE AS I THINK AND AND NO AIRCRAFT CARRIED AT THAT POINT AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY THE GERMAN CONVOY THAT WAS GOING TO LEAVE EAGER AND AND WAS GOING TO HUG THE COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO AN STO STAVANGER WHERE WE WERE BUT WE WERE THE OTHER FORCE WAS TO STOP AND GET IN THERE SO DO ON TWELVE O'CLOCK THE AND THE OTHER FORCE WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE CONVOY AND THEY WERE HOPING IN THAT CASE WHEN THAT STARTED TO BE LOTS OF FIREWORKS DOWN FURTHER ALONG THE COACHES QUITE A FEW HUNDRED MILES BUT THAT WOULD TAKE THE HEAT OFF WHAT WE WERE DOING WE WERE A KIND EST IN OPERATION THE WE WERE TO ESCORT THE APOLLO TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WAS GOING TO START LAND MINES DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK AND WE WERE TO BE BETWEEN HER IN AND NORWEGIAN COAST AND IF SHE WAS SIGHTED ON BY THE GERMANS AND OR PICKED UP BY RATE OF BY THE GERMANS AND LABOR TO START FIRING WE WERE TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS WE COULD AND TEAR UP AND DOWN THE BIT OF SHE BETWEEN US AND BETWEEN THE APOLLO AND THE NORDEN COUGHED AND THAT YOU ALDEGUNS AND FLARES AND EVERYTHING WE COULD TO TAKE THE HEAT OF HER SO DID ATTACK US AND SO THE APOLLO AND WOULD HAVE I HAVE FLASHED US OR INDICATED TO US OR NOT ON THE SHORE BECAUSE YOU GIVE EVERYBODY HAD TO KEEP RADIO SILENCE AND ON WE WERE ON CHARLOTTE ROUTINE NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO SMOKE SHOW ANYTHING YOU WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO THE BANK BECAUSE THE NOISE AND WE WERE NOT FAR AWAY FROM THE COAST AT AN ON BUT THE TRIPS BOTH US AND THE OTHER ESCORT DESTROYED AS ELIAS HAD TO KEEP UP AS MUCH STEAM AS WE COULD BECAUSE IF THE FIREWORK STARTED WE WERE TO HAVE TO AT FULL SPEED RUSH UP AND DOWN THIS BIT OF COAST FAR IN WHATEVER WE COULD PREVENT THEM TO TO THE APOLLO WELL I COULD HEAR FROM THE GUNS CAUSES IN THE AN A T S AND FROM A DIRECTOR AND BEFORE WE STARTED DOING ANYTHING AND I COULD HEAR THE PEOPLE THE GUN AND WE'LL GET A A HEADLIGHT SAY THEY'RE JUST JUST OVER THERE A LITTLE BIT THEY CAN'T COMING DOWN GOING FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT LIKE AN ERA IS THAT I HOPE THEY CAN'T ASK FOR WHERE THEY ARE AND THEN HE SAID RIGHT HAVE STARTED DOWN THE OTHER END AND THEY STARTED FIRING DOWN AT THE OTHER END THEY ATTACKED HIS CONVOY AND DONE THEY HAVE BEEN EASIER WE COULDN'T I COULDN'T SEE ANY ANYWAY CAUSE I'VE DONE IN A S BUT IS GETTING OLDER MESSAGES FROM A NOT THE TWO OFFICERS UP IN THE DIRECT A TOWER BUT FROM MY MATES ON A GUN BEGUN EX CAN WIRE GUN THEY HAVE FINAL THE INFORMATION IN THE MATE I THOUGHT I THINK THAT BLOWS SMOKING OVER THE YOU KNOW ON THAT I REALLY CAN'T SEE US ANY WAY APPARENTLY YET THEY DIDN'T WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO MUCH BUT TRY WE WERE SORRY CRUISING UP AND DOWN AND THE UN APOLLO STARTED LOW IN OUR MINDS DEAD ON TIME DID ON TWELVE O'CLOCK AND THE THE MINE OUT A BIG MAN LAYER THEY CARRIED ON NOT MIND A BIG CRUISER THEY ARE AND ONCE THEY SHAN'T LAY IN A MINE AND THAT WHERE WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME IN THEY CAN'T STOP THEY'VE GOT TO DO THE WHOLE OF THE MINE LAYING BECAUSE THE MIND FOR BEING LAID SO THEY CAN'T TURN BACK THEY CAN ONLY GO ON AND CARRY ON LAY IN THE MIND TO ANYWAY WE'RE JUST GOING SHOWING UP AND DOWN AND AND BECAUSE OUR SHIP WAS KEEPING STEAM UP READY FOR A QUICK DASH UP AND DOWN THE VEIL BLUE SO YOU GOT A NORMAL IS A WELL KNOWN DESTROYER UP UP UP WHICH WE DO EVERY TIME I COME IN AND OUT OF HARBOUR JUST TO SIGNAL AND APPARENTLY EVERYBODY WENT MAD THE CRUISER WON'T MAD YOU IN CHARLOTTE ROUTINE YOU KNOW AND THEN THE FACT THAT WE WERE NEVER SUED OUT NOT TO THE VERY END AND I THINK IT MIGHT EVEN BE IF ANYBODY HAD HEARD THAT ROPE WHICH IS A WELL KNOWN BRITISH DESTROYER SIGNAL TO SAY EM COMING INTO HARBOUR SOMEWHERE IF THEY THOUGHT I CAN'T BE BRITISH DESTROY NOT BE IN HIS DAFT ENOUGH TO DO A THING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW SO ANYWAY AND THEY LAID LAID THE MINDS AND THEN WE KNEW I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CHICKEN OR WHAT SHE SAID ALL DONE NOW WE CARRIED OUT AMBITION SHE YOU BACK IN POLE AND I WAS AT THAT TIME LISTENING TO SOME OF THE YEAR ONE AND THEY WERE SAYING LOOK AT HER MOVE AND SHE WAS DOING FORTY KNOTS SHE'S RUN THE FASTEST SHIP TO HER AND THEY COULD SEE THE BAIL WAVE MANAGE IT IS NIGHT THAT AND IT WAS STARLIGHT AND YOU COULD SEE YOU COULD SEE THE SHORE YOU COULD SEE THE PLACE WHERE THE CONES WERE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A CRACKER IS OF THE KNOWN AND AN AWAY WENT THE AND APOLLO AND AND AT SPEED AND AND WE TURNED ROUND BUT WE WE WENT AS FAR AS WE COULD BUT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO AT A GOOD SPEED BECAUSE WE GOT A SIGNAL THAT THE GERMANS JUST OUT THAT THEY WILL BE INTACT ESPECIALLY FROM EAGERSANED WITH THE BETTER WE ARE ON THE NEW AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE AFTER ITS ON THE APOLLO WHEN IT CANTEEN I SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD AND THEY RELY ON TO A MONSTER TELEGRAPHY OFFICE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT WE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED OR THE FAULT HAD BEEN CHALLENGED CHILD HAD PICKED US UP ON RADAR THE FAULT HAD BEEN CHALLENGED AND HE THINKS THAT THE AM APOLLO WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF COURSE AND GIVEN THE RIOT CHALLENGE A ANSWER BUT THEN THEY CHALLENGED AGAIN LATER ON AND DIDN'T GET THE APOLLO HAD STARTED DISAPPEARING SO THEY SENT TORPEDO BOMBERS AFTER US AND DONE THEY NEVER FOUND US SO WE GOT BACK OKAY SO DEMANDED HIS SUCCESSFUL OUR FORCE DOWN AND FURTHER INK INKERSAN A EAGERSAND AND STOPPED THE CONVOY GOING UP GERM ADD THE GERMAN CONVOY THE DAN SUNK ONE OR TWO OF THE SHIPS AND MONITOR OF OUR SHIPS HAD ADDED INJURED PEOPLE BUT ON THE WHOLE MISSION WAS SUCCESSFUL IT IS TO ME LIKE YOU WERE EXPENDABLE WHEN YOU ARE AT ONE WITH YOU OUR BUT WHY IS IT ONLY THOUGHT DESTROYED WITH A VALUABLE BEING KITS TO A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF DESTROYER AND IT'S COMFORTABLE YET BECAUSE WHAT I WORSHIP I SHALL BRING IN IS BECAUSE LATER ON I'M WHERE WHEN THIRTY END OF THE WAR WHICH WON'T BE IN THAT ONE IS WHEN WE WERE A BIG FALSE ESCORT IN SOME OF THE CRUISE OUT TO THE FAR EAST WE ONLY TOOK EM AS FAR GIBRALTAR YOU SEE AND THEN ANOTHER FALSE TAKES OVER BUT WE WERE ESCORTING A BATTLESHIP THE RENOWN AND WE WERE THE CLOSE ESCORT WONDER SO EACH SIDE FREDDYCLOSE WHEREAS OTHERS WERE FERRET OUT AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY LIKE THIS AND I WASN'T ON A JUG JUST LEANING OVER SIDE BUT WE WERE QUITE CLOSE BECAUSE THE CLOSEST CALL YOU SEE AND I'M JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE AND OVER THE TANNOY COME THE VOICE FROM THE CAPTAIN WE ARE NOW REACHING A DANGEROUS AREA AND THERE MIGHT BE YOU BOATS AROUND IF YOU BOAT AS FIRE A TORPEDO AND THAT IS AND PICKING UP OF WHAT IT WHICH WE SEE THAT TO TRACK OF THAT TORPEDO HEADING TOWARD BIG SISTER WHICH I CALLED RENOWN THEN WE STOP IT YOU KNOW WHAT WE MEAN HERE YOU STOP IT AND THERE'S ME LOOKING OVER THE SIDE LOOKING AT THE TORPEDO BULGE ON THE RENOWN AND THINKING YOURSELF YES YOU CAN LOSE TWO HUNDRED MEN JUST AS TOP OF TORPEDO BENDING LITTLE TORPEDO BUMBLED YOU KNOW YOU DON'T YOU TELL ME TO BE ABOUT THE ROLLER WITH HIS TROYER WELL ROLL ROLE OF THE MOST DESTROYERS IS THERE FAST AND THE MANOEUVRABLE AND THEY'RE LIKE A SMALL VERSION OF A CRUISE THEY HAVE OLDER GUNNERY BUT SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'VE GOT FOUR BIG GUNS FOR POINT FIVE BEGUN AND OTHER SMALLER GUNS HAD TO ALL THOUGH THE ONE THING THEY'VE GOT EXTRA AND APART ON THE SMALLER SIDE SCALED DOWN THE BIG SHIPS HAVE NOT GOT ANTI SUBMARINE EQUIPMENT THEY'VE GOT TO PETERS AND THINGS BUT UNLESS THEY'RE SUMMA ON THE SURFACE THEY GOT NO DEBT CHARGES SO AND DESTROYER HAS STEP CHARGES SO WE WERE THERE TO BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIFFERENCE THE REASON WHY YOU GOT A DESTROYER AS WELL IS JUST AS I SAID IF THE AND CAPITAL SHIP OF WHAT AD IS YOUR GUARDIAN IS TORPEDOED THE LAST RESULT IS YOU GETTING WAY OF THE TORPEDO DID RATHER LOSE A SHIP THAT ONLY GOT TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED MEN ON MOULD THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING MODERN TO HUNDRED MEN ON THE BATTLESHIP REMOTE AS IT MIGHT BE IF IT'S GOT A TORPEDO BOLD AND THIS WAR WE SHARE TO OF SHORT OF DESTROYERS BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM GET LOST BECAUSE THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN A TORPEDO IS SITED IS TO GO TO ATTACK THE SUBMARINE THAT FIRED IT BUT YOU SHOULD BE NEAR ENOUGH TO GET A WAY OF TO TORPEDO IF I AM TO BE HEAD IN YOUR WAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALK A BIT HOW YOU WEREN'T SEEN YOU WERE VERY YOUNG THROUGH THE MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE ON BOARD WAY YOU THOUGHT WE WORK IN BRILLIANTLY KNOW AND WELL NOT REALLY YOU JUST TO FIT IN AND PART OF LIFE IS YOU YOU MANAGE TO FIT IN TO EVERY SITUATION IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH AND ON YOU ALTHOUGH NEVER WORRIED AND YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU A GOOD SWIMMER YOU MUST BE WHY EVEN IF THE SHIP'S INKS BUT THEN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU SPEAK RATHER PEOPLE YOU'VE GOT SEA BOOTS ON AT THE TIME YOU HAVE A S A BELT WHICH AND SHOULD SHAVE YOU WHICH YOU WEAR ALL THE TIME AT SEA BUT YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT BELT BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT GETS IN THE WAY OF YARNS AND EVERYTHING SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU HAVE TO JUMP INTO THE HOGAN AS THEY CALL IT THE SEA THAT BELT MUSTN'T BE BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT MIGHT BREAK YOUR ARMS SO YOU EXPECTED TO BLOW THAT UP WHEN YOU HIT THE SEA AND THEN I CAN'T SAY IT LUCKILY I NEVER HAD TO BUT I HAVE SURVIVORS HAVE TOLD ME YES I HAD TO BLOW IT UP AS SOON AS I HIT THE WATER AND I HAD NO BREATH AT ALL LEFT I COULDN'T BLOW IT UP BUT THE SEA BOATS DRAG YOU DOWN BECAUSE THE DISH IS WHAT YOU'RE WEARING IT'S IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WAS THE NEXT BIG OF AN YOU WOULD CALL HIM WHETHER IT WAS REALLY MUNDANE MOST THE THINGS EVEN EVEN AN A AT ESCORT TO THE MONSTERS THAT WE DID THE YOUR ENEMY IN MOST CASES WAS TO SAY WE GOT BATTERED LEFT RIGHT AND CENTRE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE CREAMERY AND QUEEN ELIZABETH BECAUSE AS WE TOOK THEM OUT OF THE CLOUD WE JIG JAG ROLLED AWAY WITH THEM AND WE KEPT UP WITH THEM TILL THEY REACHED THE TOP SPEED WHICH AND WAS DEDITIONED ABOUT FURTHER THE WAY ACROSS AND THEN WE LEFT THEM AND WE D HAVE WAITED AROUND FOR THE NEXT ONE COMING IN FOR INSTANCE WE MIGHT TAKE THE QUEEN MARY OUT AND WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO WAIT JUST A FEW HOURS FOR THE QUEEN ELIZABETH I HAD COME IN AND DONE ALL THE TIME ONE OF YOU MIGHT PICK UP ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU AS THE QUEEN MARY WOULD HAVE ITS OWN AS DICK BESIDES ITS OWN RADAR AND WE OF COURSE AT THE AS DICK AND RADAR ON OUR COHORT PERHAPS TO CAVALIER WOULD BE THE SAME WELL WHEN WE'D STEAM OUT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE A PART AT THE EXTREMES OF YOUR AT AS DICK CIRCLE AND YOU RATE OUR CIRCLE SO YOU DIDN'T INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHER'S RETREAT OF THE THE WAVE AND IF WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH MIGHT BE A SUBMARINE MIGHT BE A RACK AND IMMEDIATELY WE RUN UP A BLACK FLAG ON OUR FLAG DECK SO THE QUEEN MARY WOULD KNOW AND WE'LL SHOW THE CAVALIER WOULD KNOW THAT WE'VE PICKED UP AN ECHO IMMEDIATELY WE'D HIVE OFF TO ATTACK THE ECHO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE IN TROUBLE IF IT IS IF THAT'S A YUGO YOU MIGHT HAVE ALREADY FIRED ITS TORPEDO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU TURN OFF SWIFTLY AT FULL SPEED IF YOU CAN IF YOU GOT A BEAM SEE IF YOU COULDN'T TURN OFF LEFT ALL RIGHT IT WOULD A BEAM SEE A DESTROY GOT HARDLY ANY DRAUGHT YOU TURN OVER STRAIGHT AWAY SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY EAGER WE NEVER DID WHETHER IT LUCK OR IS MY JUDGMENT I DON'T KNOW THEN YOU WAY THEN IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HIT TALK A THOUGH THEN YOU'D FIND YOUR WAY TO WERE OF THAT I'M ECHO WAS AND YOU WOULD ATTACK THE ECHO SO YOU RUSH OFF ABOUT TWO DEPTH CHARGES FROM ONE SIDE TO FROM THE OTHER AND ROLL OFF OFF THE TWO RACKS ON THE REAR SO AS PATTEN ABOUT TEN CHARGES WELL IF THE UBA IS A VERY EXPERIENCED ONE AND HE WAS WATCHING YOU ON THE PERISCOPE HE WOULDN'T BE THERE WHEN YOU ARRIVED HE WOULD I'D HAVE GONE DOWN LOW OR HE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BUT LEAST YOU KEPT HIM DOWN THERE 'S NO CHANCE OF HIM HIT IN YOUR CHARGE AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO TRY TO GET IT UP TAKE ABOUT HALF A DAY BECAUSE YES THEY KEEP THE SAME SPEED EVEN IF THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO LEAVE THE QUEEN MARY OR TO QUEEN ELIZABETH THE QUEEN MARY WOULD CARRY ON IT WOULDN'T STOP AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY'D ACTUALLY TO DO TO QUEEN MARY THEN I WOULD HAVE LOST A LOT OF LIVES BECAUSE WHILE YOU'RE THE QUEEN MARY IF IT'S COMING BACK IN IT HAVE A FULL COMPLIMENT OF AMERICAN GIS THAT WOULD BE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND WOULD BE CARRYING NOW THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TIGHTEN UP THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING FROM THE DIFFERENT DECKS ALL THE TIME IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF WE GO INTO ACTION STATIONS THEN WE CLOSE OUR WATER TIGHT DOORS WHICH MEANS OF YOUR TORPEDO YOUR MIND IT WILL ONLY DAMAGE THE COMPARTMENT WITH OR WITHIN SO THE SHIP MOST LIKELY WON'T SINK BUT IF IT'S ON THE CREAM MARY DIDN'T HAVE GOT NO CHANCE OF ANY OTHER WATER TIGHT DOORS BEING CLOSED BECAUSE TRAVELLING BETWEEN A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DECKS THEY'RE TRAPPED SLEEPING ON ONE DECK TRADING UP THE NECK DECK TO EAT FOOD ANOTHER DECK FOR EXERCISE TOP DECK IS ALWAYS EXERCISE TO COULDN'T OF CODE COAT ADFA DOORS OR ANY OF THOSE WHO'D HAVE BEEN ON THE BIGGEST DISASTERS WOULD FIND WHAT WAS YOU LIKE SEEING THE HAPLESS THE QUEEN MARY THE QUEEN ELIZABETH THE SAME ONE YOU HAVE ANY FIND WITH ANY MILITIA THAT YOU KNEW OF THEM WERE PROUD OF ANY ONE WELL ON AN ALL WE REALLY KNEW WAS THAT WE WAS GOING TO PICK UP ON THE MONSTERS OR BRING ONE MONSTER IN OR OR IF IT WAS THE QUEEN MARY AND WE WERE IN GREENOCK THEN WE WOULD KNOW IS THE GREEN THE QUEEN WHERE WERE TAKEN OUT AND THAT'S ALWAYS GOT THREE FUNNELS ANYWAY IF WE PICKED UP IF HE'S GOT THREE FUNNELS ITS QUEEN MARY AND GOT TWO FUNNELS IS QUEEN ELIZABETH AND SO ON YOUR FORMER FOUR FUNNEL FOR THE AQUITANIA AND SO IT WENT ON BUT YOU WERE NEVER TOLD YOU WERE JUST CHILE OUTS AND AND GO TO RENDEZVOUS WHERE YOU'D WAIT AROUND OR YOU'VE ALREADY CONTACT WITH THAT SHIP TO TELL YOU THERE AND YOU BRING IT IN VERY OFTEN A EVEN WE TWO WERE ESCORTS ONE WOULD BE A GREEN LOOK AT THE CLYDE THE OTHER BE DOWN AT LIVERPOOL AND WE WOULD REACH A POINT OF RENDEZVOUS GOING OUT OF THE CLOUD AND THE OTHER ON THE CAVALIER TRAPS COME OUT TO LIVERPOOL AND IN WE TEAM UP TOGETHER TO THE AND I RUN DIVE POINT FOR THE AND THE MONSTER DID THIS HAPPEN ALMOST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK FOR A MALE ALL OF US WE NEVER HAD THE SAME COHORT AND BECAUSE THAT WOULDN'T ALWAYS BE IN THE SAME AREA THEY'D BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE AND BETWEEN THAT IS YOUR DUTY SHIP IF AND THERE WAS AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER WHICH HAPPENED IN ONE CASE ON MENTAL PEDOGE WE JUST COME DOWN FROM SCUPPER TO A TO GREENOCK AND WE'D JUST ARRIVED AT THE HARBOUR ENTRANCE WE WENT STRAIGHT TO AN OILER BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO FILL UP WITH OIL BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO OUT AND JUST AS WE AT THE OILER WE GOT NEW MERCY CALL TO SAY THAT SOME AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER HAD BEEN TORPEDO JUST OUT IN THE AND A CLYDE THE BEGINNING OF THE CLYDE SO WE AND JUST LET GO FROM THE OILER AND WE WENT STRAIGHT OUT TO A TO DO THE THAN IT WAS IN OUR AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND STRANGELY ENOUGH SHE WAS ON HER OWN SHE'D COME FROM LONDERRY SHE'D HAD NO ESCORT AND LUCKILY SHE DIDN'T HAVE A FULL COMPLIMENT OF A OF SEAMEN AND SO FORTH AND SHE WOULD COME INTO AND TO THE CLYDE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THE TORPEDO THAT TORPEDOED IN A MERKIN SHIP AT THE SAME TIME AND YOU BUT GOT AWAY ALTHOUGH WE WENT TO ATTACK IT IT WAS DARK AND A WE LEFT THE OTHERS I THINK LOOK INTO THE NEW BOAT OFFERS WHERE WE CAME CAME BACK IN HARBOUR ON HOW LONG YOU WOULD SEE WHEN YOU ARE IN LATIN AND OFTEN GOING BACK TO BASE IN GETTING IN AND LOW IN A DESTROY NOT VERY LONG BECAUSE YOU YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT MUCH FUR UNDER YOURS USING YOU STOP SPEED ALWAYS MANEUVERING YOUR ONLY WAY OF GETTING FUEL IF YOU'RE OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS FOR FROM ONE OF BIGGER SHIPS OTHER FROM AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER OR SOMETHING AS BIG AS A BELFAST A CRUISE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ALSO FOOD YOU FOOD RUNS OUT AFTER A SHORT WHILE SO THE ONLY TIME WE'VE REALLY OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS WHEN WE'RE UP AT SCUPPER WHEN HE'S ON WORKING UP WHEN WE'RE GOING OUT ON THEM FOR AS TO A TO HELP TO SINK THE TIP TO PITS OR DOING OTHER JOBS MOST OF THE OTHERS IT WAS A CASE OF GOING OUT JUST FOR A DAY OR TWO TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS AND THEN COME BACK WITH THE MONSTER OR TAKE ONE OUT AND LEAVE IT IN WHICH CASE WE'D HAVE TO GO TO LONDON DERRY PERHAPS AND THEN WE COME OUT LONDONDERRY AGAIN AND I'LL GO OUT ON THAT SHOW WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT RESPECT NO WE WERE NOT OUT FOR A VERY LONG THE ONLY ON ONE OCCASION WHEN WE WAS OUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME MUST BE OVER TO FIVE DAYS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE OCCASION WAS BUT WE HAD RUN OUT FOOD AND WE WAS FURTHER UP IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND OUR CAPTAIN WAS A EX FISHERY FLEET MAN HAD HIS OWN FISHERY FLEET MEN SO WHAT HE DECIDED TO DO AS WE RUN OUT THE FOOD HE SAID I KNOW WHERE THE FISH THOUGH HE GUIDED THE SHIP UP TO WHERE HE KNEW THEY WERE PICKED UP A SHOW ON THE RADAR IT ON THE AZTEC DROPPED A SET AGE LOWERED THE BOAT PICKED UP ALL FOOD OF FISH THAT CAME UP AND STUNNED AND STOOD ON THE FORE SHALL WE SAW HIM SAT ON THE FORECASTLE AND SAID UP MY MIND PEOPLE IS ONE WE LIVED ON FISH FOR A FEW MORE DAYS AFTER THAT ONE BIGGER BUT OUR RUNS WERE MOSTLY AND JUST ABOUT FIVE DAYS AT A TIME BUT THAT MEANT THAT EVERY TIME WE CAME IN TO THE ER A EITHER SCUPPER OR IF WE WERE IN LIVERPOOL OR TO THE DECIDE WE HAD TO ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF FUR ON BOARD BECAUSE I ASSURE DIS ASSURE AND THE DUTY DESTROYER AND THEN IF SOMETHING COMES UP WHERE SHIPS BEEN SUNK WE HAVE TO GO OUT STRAIGHT AWAY AND YOU MIGHT BE OUT FOR A LONG TIME LOOKING FOR A SOBERING OR ONE ON SOBERING SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THE FACT THAT WE NEVER WENT OUT FOR A LONG TIME I AVOIDED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OILING AND SEE WHICH IS A DANGEROUS PRACTICE ANYWAY AND PICKING UP FOOD EVERYTHING FRONT FROM IT CAN YOU IS QUITE RAGE YES I NOTION RAY IGHT YES VERY ODD FOR FIRST OF ALL WHEN ONE ON THE RAID OR SET IS ONLY A SMALL SET AND A IT THEY ARE DIFFERENT TYPES THAT THE TWO NINE THREE THAT IS HIGH UP IN A MASK AND THAT SPECIALLY FOR PICKING UP AN AIRCRAFT OR SURFACE SHIPS REALLY ANY ANY DISTANT UPON CAN'T THINK OF THE RAT RANGE RANGE OF IT BUT IT SENDS OUT A SIGNAL FROM THERE WHICH OF COURSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT ANYTHING YOU DON'T GET IT BACK BUT IF IT HITS ANYTHING EVEN CLIFFS OR OR AN AIRCRAFT OR SURFACE SHIP THEN IT BALANCES BACK AND ON THE SCREEN VIEW ON WHICH IS A A ROUND SCREEN UNDER THE A THE CURSE IS GOING ROUND ALL THE TIME THAT WILL SHOW A BLIP ON THAT BLIP YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S ON A CLOUD WHICH IT MIGHT BE I DEPEND ON YOUR RADAR WHAT IT'S DOING A VERTICAL OR ANGER AND YOU WILL THEN READ OFF THE DISTANCE AND THE ANGLE OF EVERYTHING THIS IS MOSTLY ON ONE LEVEL BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER SCREAM WHICH GIVES YOU THE HEIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT SO YOU YOU USE ONE WITH THE OTHER THAT THAT AND WHEN AT A SIGNAL ELECTRONIC SIGNAL HITS ANYTHING THEN IT RETURNS AND THEN YOU YOU READ OFF THE DISTANCE OF IT BUT IT EAT IT IS NOT ITS EASIER TO USE AND WHERE WE FIND A DIFFICULTY IS MY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN WHAT YOU LOOKING AT ON THE LAND BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF IT ON THERE OR IF IT'S A SMALL BLIP THEN IT IS AN AIRCRAFT A SHIP OR WHATEVER IF IF YOU KNOW YOUR USING ONE TYPE OF RADAR IT'S ONLY AND ONLY HORIZONTAL IF YOU USE ANOTHER ONE COMES HORIZONTAL OR AN AIRCRAFT AND IT WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD DISTANCE THE TIME IT TAKES OF COURSE IS BASED ON IT TAKES TEN SECONDS GET FROM HERE TO THERE THEN THE AND YOU READER OFTEN SCREAM LUCKILY AT OUR POINT IN OR WE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE IN AIRCRAFT THE ONLY TIME WE WOULD HAVE HAD PROMO FOR THAT IS IF THE TORPEDO BONES HAD BEEN SENT AFTER US OFTEN AWAY THEN WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO USE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD NOW GET THE ANT WE'D HAVE TO USE A TWO RAID OUR SETS THAN THE ONE WHICH GIVES YOU A SIGNAL IN THE HEIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT THE OTHER ONE WHICH GIVES YOU A DISTANCE OF IT AND THEN YET YOU'RE TRAINED TO NO RICHER THE DIFFERENCE AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT FAR AS I REMEMBER IF IT WAS ONE OF YOUR OWN AIRCRAFT IT WOULD HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION SIGNAL WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW ON YOUR RED OR SAT BEFORE IT HAD GOT TO YOU SO YOU YOU'D HAVE TO BE PRETTY WELL EXPERIENCED BUT MY TIME WOULD NOT ALWAYS ON A RADAR SET YOU ARE SOMETIMES A LOOK OUT AS A SEAMAN WHERE YOU'RE SETTING UP IN THE LOOKOUT BOX ON THE STAR SIDE WAS MINE AND YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR AIRCRAFT WHICH WAS NOT VERY OFTEN BEFORE A SURFACE SHIPS OR MORE THAN LIKELY YOU ARE LOOKING OUT FOR A LITTLE TINY PERISCOPE WHICH IS VERY HARD TO SEE IN A ROUGHER ATLANTIC OR YOU MIGHT BE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE THE TRACK OF A TORPEDO COMING TOWARD YOU IN WHICH CASE YOU GET INTO A PANIC AND A CALL OUT QUICKLY TO THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE AND THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE AND THE CAPTAIN OR THE AN OFFICER OR THE OTHER WAS AT THE TIME IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE NOWADAYS IT'S ENCLOSED BECAUSE AN OPEN BRIDGE SO THE BRIDGE IS HERE YOU GOT TO LOOK OUT AS JUST HERE TO JUST CALL OUT TO THAT PERSON ON THE BRIDGE OFFICER SHIP BEARING RED FIVE O GREENFIE WHERE WERE YOUR POSITION IS ANGLE OF SIGHT IF IT'S AN AIRCRAFT AND IN MEALY A LOOK AT IT AND DECIDE YOUR ACTION TO TAKE BUT IF YOU THAT LOOK OUT POSITION WHICH I WAS ON QUIET A LOT AS A SEAMAN IS ROUGH BECAUSE AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN ALL THE TIME BEEN A DESTROYER YOU ALMOST A SUBMARINE AT TIMES THE WHOLE OF THE SEA COMES OVER YOU AND YOU GET NOT BACK AGAINST THE SEARCH LINE IT'S VERY DAMP THAT IS VERY ROUGH UNCOMFORTABLE BUT AND THIS IS GOING TO GET USED TO YOU USED TO WEAR AND A SPECIAL SUIT WHICH COVERED YOU COMPLETELY WATER SUIT WITH CAPTAIN AND BUT EVEN EVEN THAT THE WATER ALL THE WAY DOWN AND YOU GO SOAKING WET I REMEMBER COMING OFF WATCH ON ONE OCCASION LIKE THIS CAUSE NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO CLIMB BACK DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE LADDER TO THE SHIP BECAUSE THE DOORS THAT YOU WOULD GO IN AND OUT IN PORT OR OPEN WHEN YOU OUGHT TO SEE THOSE DOORS SHALL BE CLOSED BECAUSE THE WATER COMES IN THOSE SHALL YOU HAVE TO CLIMB DOWN LADDERS DOWN THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP NOT NOT OUTSIDE IN THE SEA BUT CLIMB DOWN FROM THE TOP BACK TO THE ADE AND IF YOU NOT CAREFUL THE WAVE IN IT HITS YOU YOU CAN GET WASHED AWAY YOU HOLD ON VERY TIGHT WELL THIS WAS THE MIDDLE WATCH THAT I CAN RECALL WHICH IS FROM TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TWELVE COVE AT NIGHT TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BUT YOU'RE NOT ON WATCH AND LOOK OUT ALL THAT TIME OF THE FOR OUR WATCH YOU DO DIFFERENT JOBS AROUND ON LOOK OUT OF OUR CAT FROM THE RADAR AT OF OUR ONE HALF HOUR BEHIND A GUN WHERE THERE'S A GOD YOU BECOME PARTLY GUN CREW SO IF YOU DID HAVE TO GO INTO ACTION YOU WOULD DO THE SHOOTING OR THE REAL GONE THROUGH IS CALLED UP TO TAKE OVER FROM YOU WELL ON THIS OCCASION IT HAD BEEN VERY WELL OUTSIDE I'D GOT CHOKING AND TIRED OF SAME MIDDLE WATCH FROM ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK I'D COME DOWN I WENT DOWN TO MY MISTAKE WHICH HAD DINNER FOR CAR IS A ROUGH PART THE SHIP I HADN'T LOVE MY HAMMOCK I'D SLEPT ON ME A CUSHIONS THIS TIME I I DIDN'T FANCY SLEEPING ON A CUSHION BECAUSE THE SHIP WAS GOING SO MUCH THIS WAY ON YOU WOULD COME OFF THE CUSHIONS SO I GOT DOWN UNDER THE MESS TABLE IS ABOUT THAT MUCH WATER ON THE FLOOR THE DECK TORY NOT THE FLOOR ON THE DECK ABOUT THAT MUCH SO I GO MY COAT ON IS THIS SUIT SO CALLED IT IN EVERYTHING AND I'M LAYING DOWN ON OFF TO SLEEP STRAIGHT AWAY NEXT TO GO NOW I THOUGHT I'D TOUCH ME AND I OPEN MY BLEARY EYES AND THERE WAS THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH AND THE LEADING SEAMAN OF THE MESS AND YOU SAYING TO ME I'M TOLD IS IN THE MORNING BY THE LEADING HAND OF THE MESS HE SAID THE OFFICER SAID YOU COME ON SEA WHEN YOU CAN'T SLEEP UNDER THERE IS TOO WET AND I SAID AND HE LOOKED AT THE LEADING HAND AND SAID WHAT DID HE SAY AND THE NAMES OF DEAD READ THAT LANGUAGE AND SO OH WELL WE'D BETTER LAY YOU LET HIM SLEEP THERE LOOKING THERE NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT IT I BY YOU YOU LINE IN THAT MUCH WATER THE THE DECKS OF THE SHIPS WERE INSIDE NOW INSIDE YOUR MYSTIC THE WATER JUST IT'S A ONE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE AND A LITTLE BIT WARMER INSIDE SHOW ALL HUMIDITY ALL THE WATER RUNS DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE DECKS ANY TIME YOU ON THE CAVALIER YOU YOU HAVE A LOOK INSIDE CUSHYOUR METAL WORK OF THE SHIP'S SIDE IS ONLY ABOUT EIGHT OF AN INCH NO THICKER THAN THAT AND AND SO THERE THERE ARE WHERE YOU GOT WATER MOST OF TIME ON YOU YOU ON DOMESTICS WHEN YOU'RE AT SEE AND IN HARBIN NOT TOO BAD IT GETS TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE THERE WAS ANOTHER TIME WHEN WE WORKED WITH A QUEEN MARY AND WE HAD TO PICK HER UP TO BRING HER ON WE WENT OUT NETTING UP ONE OF THE ROUGHEST STORMS THAT WE HAD ABOUT THREE REALLY ROUGH STORMS IN THE PERIOD THAT WE WERE IN IN THE ATLANTIC AND WHAT WE HAD TO AT THIS TIME BE ABOUT MARCH NINETY FORTY FIVE WE HAD TO GO AND PICK UP THE QUEEN MARY NOW THAT THE STORM HAD BEEN RAGING ALL AWAY FROM AMERICA AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE THAT THE ICON DAD COME ACROSS OUR WAY AND THE CREAMERY HAD BROUGHT IT WITH US SORT OF THING AND WE PICKED HER UP AND I THINK WE RE A DAY OR MORE WAITING TO PICK HER UP BECAUSE EVEN SHE HAD BEEN HELD UP BY THE BAD STORMS WELL WE AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAS A SISTER SHIP AT THAT TIME BUT WE GOT REALLY BENT UP WE LOST A MOTOR BOAT WE LOST AND ONE OF THE AND WHALERS AND AND WE GOT REALLY KNOCKED OUT AND WHEN WE GOT AND TOWARDS THE CLYDE THE QUEEN TO QUEEN MARY KNOWING THAT IT WAS IN THE AREA THAT THERE WOULD BE BOATS WE HAD TO RELY ON HER SPOT SO AS AS WE HAVE GOT WITHIN HAILING DISTANCE OPPOSING SAY OF UNDER THE CLYDE AND THE QUEEN MARY DECIDED SHE COULDN'T SLOW DOWN TO KEEP UP WITH US CASE IT WAS TOO ROUGH OF US WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER AND SO SHE JUST FLASH THE MESSAGE SHE YOU IN A CODE TATAR AND SHE KEPT UP HER SPEED AND GOT INTO THE GLIDE NOW SHE HAD THE WHOLE OF THE FRONT OF HER BRIDGE STOVED IN AND IS A BIG SHIP WELL UP IN THE AIR THEY HAD A LOT OF CASUATIES BECAUSE THEY CARING ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND TROOPS AND ON THIS WAS NOW LATE AT NIGHT I THINK ABOUT AN ELEVEN AND TOO TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT BUT ANYWAY SHE GOT INTO THE CLIDE WITH WITHOUT ANYTHING BUT DAMAGE FROM FROM THE SEA WE LIMPED IN LATER ON NOW IN THE CLYDE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO AN ANCHOR AND WE COULDN'T GO FURTHER IN TO GREENOCK TO GREEN BECAUSE AFTER THAT YOU GO THROUGH THE BOOM AND THE BOOM IS CLOSED AT NIGHT ON THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TRY TO OPEN A BOOM WHICH PREVENTS OR ELSE TO PREVENT AND YOU BOTH GETTING AT THAT POINT SO AT THE OTHER SIDE WHERE WE HAD TO RUN T UP TO A BOY WE HAVE TWO FOR JUMPERS TO TRY UP TO A BOY YOU HAVE TO STOP AND YOU HAVE TO LOWER YOU WHALER WITH THE BOY JUMPER AND THE ROW IS IN IT TO TAKE YOU TO THE BOY WITH THE TRYING TO CLIP IT TO THE BOY WELL IF I'VE GIVEN YOU A PICTURE OF HOW ROUGH THE STORM WAS IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT FIRST WHALER WE WE AN AND LET DOWN ON TO THE WATER MANAGED TO GET DOWN SAFELY BUT GOT WASHED AWAY WITH A COIN IT FURTHER DOWN THE CLYDE AT THE WAY FOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO LOWER ANOTHER WHALER ALL OF US WAS UP ON THE FORESHORE WE ARE ALL THE SAME AND THAT COULD HELP WAS UP ON THE FORESHORE AND A COULD YOU CAN'T USE YOUR ANCHOR YOU JUST USE ANACHAIN WHICH GOES WITH A WIRE ATTACHED TO THE END THE ANCHOR CHAIN UNDER THE WHALER HAS TO TAKE THIS WIRE TO THE BOY TO CLAMP IT ON TO THE BOY AND THEN THE BOYS PULLED BY THE ANCHOR CHAIN NEARER THE SHIP SO THAT THEY CLIP IT ON SO ANY WAY THEY LOWERED THE SECOND WHALER THE BOY JUMPER MANAGED TO GET ON TO THE BOY AND IN DOING SO BROKE HIS WRIST AND THE IN THE END AFTER THINK IT WAS ABOUT FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO CLIP UP TO THE BOY AND ONE THE CAPTAIN SAID TOPPED ALL ROUND A I HATED TO SMELL AROUND AN ANYONE AND NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD THE TOP THAT IS HORRIBLE BUT A WELL HAD IT THAT NIGHT BECAUSE WE WERE FROZEN FROZEN STIFF AND A WE UNDERTOOK IT AWAY WITH IT BUT NOTHING WAS EVER SAID ABOUT THIS TIME A THING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH A PEOPLE AT THE PORCH KNEW THE BIG SHIPS COME COME IN AND IT WAS NOT A THING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THE GERMANS ALSO KNEW THEY WERE BRINGING THE OLD THESE LARGE NUMBERS BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS IT COULD CARRY AND ON ANY OF THE YOU VOTE CAPTAINS I UNDERSTAND AND IT IS NORMAL KNOWLEDGE WERE OFFERED A LARGE SUM OF MONEY THOUSANDS OF AN ORGASM DOGMA THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK AND THE HIGHEST OF THE BACK OF HONOURS TO HAVE KNOCKED DOWN ANY ONE OF THE MONSTERS BUT WE NEVER LOST ONE FORTUNATELY ABUSIVE BUT THE THE QUEEN MARY AND WAS REALLY BATTERED VERY BADLY BATTERED HOW WE DIDN'T GET TURNED OVER OR NO IDEA WHEN YOU TALKING ABOUT MAKES THESE ALSO SAY TO WELL IF YOU'RE AN HE DID THE SIEGE ITSELF YOU TOLD ABOUT WELL AND THERE IS IS GENERALLY KNOWN THAT SOME ON WAVES WAS SIXTY FOOT HIGH NOW IF YOU THINK OF SIXTY FOOT GOING UP THAT WAY WHEN YOU GO UP TO THE WAVE AND YOU COME DOWN TO THE TROUGH YOU GOT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOOT AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN CUT THROUGH THOSE WAVES AND THE BIG SHIPS OR THE SMALL SHIPS YOU ACTUALLY GO UP ON THAT WAVE AND THEN YOU FEEL IT THAT YOU COME DOWN WITH A CRUNCH LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU UP TO NEXT ONE AND ALL THE TIME YOUR CORK SQUIRREL NOW UNION YOU'RE NOT STILL AND YOU GET USED TO THIS AFTER THAT FIRST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE YOU GOT TRULY ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE YOU YOU GO THROUGH A NORMAL ON CHORIC FLATS THEY CALLED ON TO STRAW THE NORMAL CORRIDOR ON THE FLOOR ON A FLAT AND TO STRAW WHICH IS ABOUT THAT WIDE WELL WHEN YOU FIRST GO ABOARD ONE LIKE THAT AND IT WAS FAIRLY CALM WHEN YOU SET OUT FOR CHCAPPER FROM GREENOCK BUT AS YOU WALK ALONG THE DECK COMES UP TO ME TO IT GOES UP AND YOU HIT YOUR FEET AS YOU GO DOWN ON THE DECK BUT BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THAT DECK HAD GONE AWAY AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN AND THIS ISSUE FROM THE TOP AND THEN ALL THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING THIS THIS BALLET IT UNLESS YOU KNOW THAT BALKET IT YOU SO IN TIME YOU LEARNED TO WALK LIKE A SAILOR AND AS THE SHIP GOING DOWN YOU GO DOWN WITH IT AND COME UP WITH IT AND THAT'S WHAT YOU FIND SAILORS AND WHEN YOU GET ASHORE THEY WORK WITH A ROLL WALK WITH A ROLL THAT IS JUST THAT THERE STILL WALKING ON THE SHIP WERE I EAT A YOU'LL NOT FINISH ON BREDA ITSELF WE WERE AND AS JUST ANNOYANCE I WE WERE BRINGING IN THE OLD FRANCE AND WHEN WE GOT NOTICED THAT THE PEACE AND HAD BEEN DECLARED FOR NEXT DAY AND WE WERE COMING IN TO GROW INTO GREENOCK SO WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN THE LAST OF THE ON CHIP CONVOYS BEFORE THE WAR ENDED WE ARRIVED IN GREENOCK I BELIEVE IT SO OR WHEN YOUR SUNDAY I'M HALF THE SHIP'S COMPANY WAS A LOUD LEAVE WHICH WASN'T ME OFF I WASN'T ONE OF THE SHIP'S COMPANY BUT THEY WENT ASHORE TO AN TO GREENOCK WHEN I GO TO A TIME SO I THEN WE STILL CARRIED ON WITH SOMEONE CONVOYS AFTER THERE BECAUSE I'M THERE WAS QUITE A FEW OF THE NEW BOATS APPARENTLY MISSION A LOT THEM ONE OR TWO WENT TO BRAZIL OR WHATEVER SO THERE WAS A CHILL STILL A CHANCE THAT IF THERE WAS A ROAD ROAD YOU BOAT AROUND AND COULD HAVE KNOCKED DOWN SOME OF THE MONSTERS WE WERE SURE BRINGING BACK IN BUT WE HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL BUT TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT ANYWAY AND WE WERE THEN DESTINED TO GO ACROSS TO THE END TRY TO END THE JAPANESE WAR SO TO BY TWO OR FLOTILLA WENT IN FOR REFITS WE WE WENT IN FOR A REFIT LATE IN MAY AND JUNE AND BECAUSE WE WERE GOING OUT THERE ANYWAY BUT FORTUNATELY WHILE I OWED ON IT AND LEAVE TO GO OUT THERE THE SHIP WAS DOWN AT AN DAVENPORT BE REFITTED THE WAR ENDED I SHALL GO TELEGRAM TO SAY DON'T LEAVE EXTRA DAILY VECTOR WHEN WE CAME BACK TO THE TRIP WE STILL HAD TO GO OUT THERE BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING TO CLEAR UP AFTER THE WAR OR AND THE WHOLE OF OUR FLOTILLA FOR OUT THEN WE WERE THE LAST TWO SO AS WE RAN OUT GIBRALTAR MALTA AIDAN AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT WE WERE THOUGHT WE RESEMBLE A LOVELY SOME CRUISE BUT THEN WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE NOW WHEN WE GOT TO DRINK MALE AT A NAVAL BASE WE BASED A DRINK MALI AND ALSO BASED AT SINGAPORE OR WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE A THIS WAS JUST ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THESE ARE AND AND WE WERE CORING OUT AN EXERCISE WITH A ATMESUSSEX AND ANOTHER SHIP AND ON THE CAPTAIN OF THE FLIER THE FLOTILLA LEADER WHO WAS ON A MISSILE AND A OURSELVES IN CAVALIER WERE ORDERED TO GO WITH THE SUSSEX TO AN A PROBLEM SO WE IMMEDIATELY WENT FOR SPEED WE WERE SENT TO A TO JAVA WE ARE STOPPED ON A COUPLE OF TROOP SHIPS ON THE WAY I CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT BUT WE TOOK ON BOARD OUR FOR OUR FULL DECK WAS COVERED WITH INDIAN TROOPS ARMED INDIAN TROOPS AND THE CAVALIERS AS I AM AND THE CAESAR WAS ALSO AND THE COSSACKS ANCHORED OUTSIDE CURABACAS IT CONGDIN WE COULD HARDLY GET IN CASE WAS A A SUNKEN A JAPANESE CRUSE IN THERE IN THE WAY SO I WAS CHOSEN WHEN IN FIRST CAUSE SHE IS PITIEDA FULL OF TROOPS WE WENT IN SECONDS AS WE WERE SECOND AND THEN THE CAVALIER AFTER US IF WE WENT IN AT DAYLIGHT WE HAD ALL THE TROOPS ON BOARD SO IF THAT ANY TROUBLE WE COULD HAVE USED OUR GUNS BECAUSE OF TROOP LUCKILY WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE FROM THE SHORE BUT AS WE CAME INTO SURABAYA I WAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE AND THERE WAS BODIES DOZENS OF THEM IN WHITE NAVAL UNIFORMS I THINK THEY WERE PROBABLY DUTCH I DON'T THINK THEY WAS OURS BUT WE WERE SLOWLY MOVING OR AVOIDING THE DISH WRECKAGE AND AVOIDING THE BODIES AND AND WE GOT TO THE SLAVE NOW WHEN WE ARE IN A WAR BODIES IN A WATER MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU EDIT ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT THEY WERE BODIES AND DEAD NOW AND THAT SO ANYWAY WE SLEAMOVED IN WE ANCHORED IN THE DOCK THERE AND AND ONE BY ONE CRUISE DISGORGED HER TROOPS FIRST AND WE CAME IN NEXT TO THE THREE OF US ALL OUR TROOPS WENT ASHORE THE DOGS HAD BEEN ALREADY TAKEN OVER BY AN ERA THE UK ARMY I THINK I BEEN BROUGHT IN AHEAD AND IT WAS THE ENGINE INDONESIAN REBELS THAT FIGHTING HAD ALREADY KILLED A BRIGADIER MALLABY THAT WAS THE ARMY BOSH AN AND THESE TROOPS WENT ASHORE AND WE STAYED THERE READY FOR AN A LOT OF SURVIVORS OF THE DUTCH PEOPLE THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS FROM A CAMP RIGHT THE OTHER SIDE OF A CURE BAR AND THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BE BROUGHT UNDER AN ESCORT OVER ANOTHER TRUCE THE BRIGADE THAT MALLABY HAD BEEN KILLED UNDER A TRUCE AND NOW THIS POSTMAN ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DUTCH PEOPLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN MOSTLY IN A CAMP THE OTHER SIDE THEY RE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS BY ANOTHER TRUCE AN ARMY TRUCKS AND GUARDED BY INDIAN TROOPS IT IN TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS TO US AND WE GOT TO HAVE THEM ON BOARD AND WE WERE TO TAKE THEM OUT TO THE TROOPERS WHICH COULDN'T GET INTO THE HARBOUR WELL WE WERE THEN TOLD WHILE WE WAIT FOR THESE PEOPLE TO COME ACROSS WE WERE TO GO OUT INTO THE WATER BECAUSE WE MIGHT BE USED WHICH WAS WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO HAPPEN WHEN THIS CONVOY OF ARMY TRUCKS GUARDED BY INDIAN TROOPS GOT AS FAR AS CUBA THEY FOUND THAT THEY WERE STOPPED ALTHOUGH HE HAD A WHITE FLAG THERE WERE STOPPED BY THE POST OFFICE WHICH WAS FULL OF INDIAN RE AN INDONESIAN REBELS THE INDIAN REBELS WERE SET UP TRENCH MORTARS AND MACHINE GUNS AND AS SOON AS THE CONVOY GOT THERE THEY SHOT THE THE TROOPS THAT WERE GARDEN CONVOY AND A CONVOY COME TO THE HALL SO WE WERE CALLED INTO USE OUR FOUR INCH FOR FIVE GUNS SO WE HAD TO A FIRE ON THE TOWN AND WE TOOK OUT THE POST OFFICE WITH THE INDIAN ASIAN TROOPS IN IT AND THEN THE CONVOY COME THROUGH WE WENT BACK INTO HARBOUR WE HAD ALL THE ON A DUTCH PEOPLE ON BOARD AND TOOK EM OUT TO SO WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T THINK I HAVE TO GO ASHORE I HAD TO GO ASHORE LATER ON TO GUARD SOME OF THE WAREHOUSES AND AND SON BUT WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO ANY FIGHTING ONLY FIGHTING READ TO DO WITH FINE CANCERS I WAS ON THE UPPER DECK AT THE TIME WHEN WE WERE CALLED IN TO FIRE AND I CALLED OFF THE UPPER DECK AND TO FIRE AN EXCELLENT AND WIGAN UNDONE I SHOULD HAVE NO ONE I SAID YOU TODAY SO I PUT ME ON THE AND ON THE GUN GUNNERY WITH ANOTHER ONE AND WE HAD THE FIRE TO THE DIRECTION OF A SPOTTER PLANE THAT WAS SENT UP BY THE ARMY AMGEN POTEPLANE AND APPARENTLY WE TOOK OUT THE POST OFFICE SO HAD THE GOOD DEAL OF COMFORT THAT WE DID HAVE A MEN BOLD OVERNIGHT A LOT THESE ARE DUTCH PEOPLE WE VACATED ALL THE FOREIGN MISTAKES AND HAD TO SLEEP DOWN AFT ON THE UPPER DECK AND DIFFERENT PLACES ON THE DUTCH PEOPLE WOMEN TO BE ARE IN THE FRONT THERE TILL WE TOOK OUT TO THE YOUNG ARE JUST THE OTHER SHIPS THAT ON AND THEN WE GOT HAVE PLACE BACK ON A LOFT A PAIR OF SANDALS THEY DISAPPEARED HOW YOU FEEL WHEN YOU SEE OR DO ANYTHING TO ENABLE PEOPLE WELL YOU YOUR ART YOUR APPREHENSIVE TO START WITH BUT AT THE AID YOU ARE ON YOUR VERY SELDOM FRIGHTENED AND I SWADE YOU YOU IN DELLA DAN DWELLER THAT GOVERN COMES BACK LATER ON AND YOU THINK YOURSELF WELL I COULDN'T CURE THERE NOW BUT I WOULDN'T AND IN THAT SAY YOU TOOK IT AND IF YOU COULDN'T TURN IF SHADOW YOU THOUGHT OF ALL THESE THINGS AT THE TIME YOU'D BE A NERVOUS WRECK BUT YOU'RE EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AND THEN WE WERE NINETEEN YEARS OLD AND ANYTHING HAPPENED AND
