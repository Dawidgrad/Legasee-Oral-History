lord west can you begin by giving us an overview of your career in the royal navy and an introduction to yourself i'm admiral the lord west of spithead i finished my career as first sea lord and then actually went into government as security minister for three years i joined the navy in nineteen sixty five at the age of seventeen my father had been an admiralty civil servant and i suppose that's part of what lead me into the navy i'd lived in singapore dockyard i'd arrived there on a troop ship with my mother at the end of nineteen forty eight and was there for some three years in which we were almost blown up by the malayan terrorists at one stage and then moved back to the west country and then up to rosyth dockyard and so all my childhood i really lived around dockyards and naval bases and as i say i joined the navy in nineteen sixty five i went in as a cadet because that was the scheme in those days effectively two terms at dartmouth a term with the dartmouth training squadron then off for a year as a midshipman which i found absolutely fantastic fun it was like rudyard kipling i was out on a minesweeper in the middle east it was a time when britain really ruled the roost out there still nineteen sixty six nineteen sixty seven we replaced the ruler of the united arab emirates he was sent off because he'd gone a bit batty and his son was put on the throne and i was a bit involved in that we visited persia as it was then because it was before the khomeini revolution went up the shatt al arab the waterway that goes up to basra it was beautiful plantations on every side green and lovely the next time i saw it was after the invasion of iraq which i lead the navy as commander in chief at that stage and it had all turned into a wasteland because the persian iraqi war had gone on for so many years there i went on a ship to a little island were we rescued the survivors of a typhoon the island then called the korea maria's sat down south of oman i was involved in resting a small ship carrying slavers so the slave trade was still going on we were shot at by the odd bedou we used to trace people down across the trucial oman scouts across into the empty quarter it was all really exciting stuff and then went down to aden where i was involved as the boarding officer in capturing a somali gunboat and then came back through suez into the mediterranean i left the minesweeper and joined the aircraft carrier albion as a midshipman still and we were sailed almost immediately we thought for a thing called the six day war in the middle east but in fact when we got to gibraltar having taken on a lot of extra commandos and ammunition we went off into the atlantic and none of us new but a thing called the biafran war was starting in nigeria and we loitered off nigeria for some five or six weeks because if they starting killing the europeans the plan was that we was going to go into lagos fly out the strategic reserve spread out across nigeria get all the europeans back into lagos and we was going to evacuate them with some other ships but luckily they didn't start doing that although it was a particularly bloody war but it gives an impression of sort of world one was in at that stage i then went and did the rest of my training as an acting sub lieutenant at dartmouth fourth year courses then joined h m s whitby which went around the world very exciting stuff again as a young officer and i then slowly qualified i became a principle warfare officer i did things like the lieutenants course i served in ship after ship as primarily an operations officer that was my prime area off expertise and knowledge i became a lieutenant commander and was out on the big deployment out to the far east by admiral stanford i joined the ships in new zealand there i was picked up for promotion to commander on that trip and i was very lucky i went straight away to command a ship h m s ardent i took her almost immediately out to the middle east and the first armilla patrol started at that stage protecting tankers and ships going into the gulf that had started at that time after that deployment i brought her home and we did some working up exocet firing we did an exercise right up of north cape just when command eight two eight eight the big defence cuts that the conservative government put in nineteen eighty one came out and i remember talking to my ships company off north cape in fact shortly after we'd laid a wreath on the previous h m s ardent that had been sunk when fighting with the scharnhorst and gneisenau in nineteen forty and i said to them sadly the government and the people who are meant to know these things have not really predicted what will happen in the world i don't believe we are likely to die fighting against the russians or the soviet threat as it was in those days i said it will be somewhere else in the world little did i know that less than a month later we were deployed to the south atlantic we lead the invasion force into the grantham sound down between the two islands they peeled off into san carlos water we were bombarding goose green and my ship was sunk there i came back to the uk and started what you could call my second career and that in dispersed with being in the ministry of defence and going back to sea and i did a period in the ministry of defence and the plans division i then went back in command of h m s bristol which was the flag ship for flag officer second flotillas and then also became the captain of the dartmouth training squadron i then went back to the mod again and did a couple of jobs i did the royal college of defence study and higher command and staff course i then went and ran i was a director general at navel manning as a two star officer and then became the commander of the uk battle group where i flew my flag almost continuously for two years primarily in illustrious but also in invincible all around the world i was out in the far east for the withdrawal from hong kong very exciting days where we were attempted to be rammed by a chinese of the coast and one could of sparked a dreadful incident which wouldn't of been good with prince charles actually sitting in hong kong i came back from that and then went and became the chief in defence and intelligence briefing all the chiefs of staff and chief of defence staff and ministers on the events particularly there was an operation called desert fox bombing of iraq at that stage but particularly the kosovo war which i was very deeply involved in i then became the commander in chief and i really lead the response to the nine eleven things with the invasion of afghanistan in two thousand and one which i think was the right thing to do at that stage and of course illustrious was used with special forces across pakistan coordinated all of that and then i became the first sea lord at the end of two thousand and two and i was first sea lord for the actual invasion of iraq which i think was probably an error invaded iraq but that's another issue but a fascinating period in the navel part of it was very successful we basically lead the right flank and took over all the alfor very successful indeed i then master minded the which was fantastic one hundred and seventy eight ships in the solent quite a special occasion and something that needed to be done and the british public rallied around although the bbc didn't twig it at the time and were then very embarrassed afterwards and of course was therefore the expansion of the war in afghanistan which i think was wrong and i finally finished in two thousand and six quite an incredible career but was it it seems like it was an early decision for you to go into the navy was it almost your destiny did you feel as a young child i think it was i think because my father was an admiralty civil servant because i'd always been around ships and when i went onboard ships very often they were all fleet auxiliaries actually i just felt instantly at home an empathy there and i suppose from an age of about eight i was absolutely set that was the only thing i wanted to do was be in the navy before eight i think i wanted to be a train driver or something but that didn't count but from the age of eight i absolutely was set on that there was nothing else i wanted to do when i was at school i didn't even make plans to do anything else at all i always wanted to do that and indeed the exams i passed at school an i could always pass exams i did them so every opportunity was available for me in the navy so i qualified i could off gone in as an engineer a seaman officer anything and i wanted to make sure i could have gone in as anything to make sure that every avenue was open and did you always want to go to sea and be in command of a ship i always wanted to go to sea i don't suppose i thought deeply enough about did i want to be in command of it i very rapidly when i got to sea and found as a midshipman when i was at sea actually doing the job at sea i realised i just absolutely loved it and i think i took to it a bit like a duck to water as well and it was then slowly over that period and then when i was a young sub lieutenant in h m s whitby then i became the acting gunnery officer actually because the gunnery officer went away and so there was a baby having just been made a lieutenant i was a gunnery officer on a frigate doing antiaircraft firing and shooting gun i slowly started thinking gosh i'd really like to command something and you sort of think this is well out of reach i was always amazed that i was there the next day in the early days of my career and delighted i was and then you slowly realise that some of these things were in reach and after a period in a ship called h m s russell i learnt a huge amount it was very very hard work i realised there was the opportunity of commanding a small ship and i went off to command h m s yarnton which was a minesweeper converted to a patrol craft based in hong kong part of the hong kong squadron again very exciting and my goodness me i absolutely loved it and we had a very exciting time we were initially trying to pick up people trying to escape from china in mirs bay shark infested i remember one occasion where we came across some of these poor people because they were often attacked by sharks in the bay there because it was a breeding ground for sharks because there was a supply of food i don't know and they were attacking some swimmers on blow up lie lows and things like this who had escaped from china and there was blood in the water and thrashing around of sharks and my coxswain leapt into the water and helped tie bow lines around these people to get them out very very brave of him but exciting moments like that and i took the ship all around the far east and down to indonesia and it was great fun and i really enjoyed it can you tell me about your involvement in the aden conflict yes we sailed i was on a minesweeper called burnaston which was up in the gulf i was a midshipman on board midshipman had crucial job like running the wardroom wine bar but also i was the boarding officer and the gunnery officer which was much more fun and much more important and we sailed down out of the gulf on our way back to gibraltar for a refit and we pulled into muscat in fact the day before christmas day and then we were sailed fairly rapidly because they'd been a cyclone which effected the korea maria islands the islanders had no water and were starving and going to die from thirst and we rushed down there between christmas and new year and dug wells for them and sorted them out gave them stores and then we went down to aden and of course this was in nineteen sixty seven when we were moving towards withdrawal and there was a lot of fighting going on with a group called flosy the freedom fighters for south yemen i can't remember what it exactly stood for but anyway that's the group and the linkages between yemen and somalia are close i mean it always has been very close constant flow of traffic it's one of the issues today with terrorism of course and yemen has always been a bit of a difficult place as i say we were fighting there then we had people fighting up in the jebel up in the hills there there was fighting going on in little aden and in crater the famous mad mitch and all of that stuff and we were anchored in the bay there we were escorting merchantmen small merchantmen with arms past aden and also doing patrols and then on one evening we were sailed very suddenly because there was a somalia gun boat coming over with arms and we intercepted it and had to board it and had a little bit of a fight and captured it and then it was a soviet ship of a type that we hadn't really looked at before nothing very special a small one but the intelligence people were very interested so i got sort of a lovely scrap from a couple of chaps that tried to come and we gave them to the army and then we had to tow this thing back to aden and we were told by the intelligence division in uk make sure that everything was kept and very carefully looked at because we need to view this but much to my horror as we headed back in towing this thing into aden we did by tying it alongside us rather than pulling it astern i kept noticing the odd sailor going disappearing onboard and of course sailors can't resist getting rabbits as they called them and i then had to have a very big whip around in the ship because i found chaps with very nice woolly furry hats for radio operators and slide rules and paper weights with russian crowns on and all this sort of stuff everywhere and i thought my god i hope they haven't taken anything that's of intelligence value it was exciting to capture and do it the night and this sort of thing and also we were trying a new technique of landing on the coastline setting up a quick patrol and then capturing arabs and i suppose i learnt a lesson as a midshipman on a big open beach went in in the middle of the night with my landing party two gemonese with people on with weapons and things and we came across and there was a much much bigger swell and breakers on the beach than i'd expected and of course it was pitch black and so the boats were tipped by these huge breakers so men were in the water i had to go back in and rescue a wireless operator who was drowning because he had the wireless strapped to him and i managed to get that off him and do it but it was a bit of a disaster really but it was my fault because i hadn't really thought through how big the breakers would be and of course we were then on this beach with terrorists around and i had to try and get some weapons ready we set up a little perimeter and then it was very difficult to talk to the ship the wireless was gone of course i got people to collect stuff together and then i used a torch to flash a message to the ship and then an army patrol came out to get us so that was a very good lesson for me to make sure one got things done properly and i remember again there was a court of enquiry on that but my sailors were all very kind the radio operator said well you saved my life sir and they were all doing this and i said that's not really the point i'm afraid i shouldn't of put it in jeopardy in the first place so it was all a it was a very good lesson served me well for the rest of my life and as you said one of your early jobs was taking command of h m s ardent can you tell me about taking command of the ship and then the preparations for the falklands war did you think britain would actually go to war yes i had what was known as a pier head jump tower because she was going to deploy to the gulf and so i had a very short period i didn't finish my commanding officers courses but i think i had enough experience to be able to do it anyway as an ops officer and things and i joined her and we rushed off to the middle east where of course i was able then to really get up to speed and learn and understand her and we came back to the united kingdom after about six months out there and we then did a maintenance period and then we did the work up at portland in very cold very icy weather i remember how cold it was and then we deployed up to north norway for an exercise with h m s invincible and the amphibious group jeremy larkin and others and in fact the very ships we were down and going to be in the falklands with we didn't know it at the time again was some pretty unpleasant weather up there but good training and exciting stuff i took my ships company to lay a wreath on the spot where the previous ardent had sunk only one survivor when they were protecting ardent and her cast were protecting h m s glorious from the scharnhorst and gneisenau sadly all were sunk one survivor from ardent and he'd been there at the launch of my ardent but sadly is dead now and what was interesting is the captain of that ardent his son was the captain of the h m s endurance in the falklands and i wrote to him and said that i'd done this and had photographs of the memorial and after i was sunk i got a letter from him because he was down in the falklands then saying he would lay a wreath where my ship was and return the photos so it's quite interesting these interconnections but we came back from norway some very very bad weather and i damaged my main armament my gun got into devonport dockyard for what was meant to be a long docking period about two days after i got in the argentineans invaded the falklands on the second of april the dockyard had told me it would take nine to ten weeks to fix my gun they changed it to nine days the carrier battle group sailed i think on the fourth or fifth of april the amphibious group on the sixth of april and i sailed a week later in company with argonaut and a couple of royal fleet auxiliaries down to ascension island and we paused there while a lot of cross decking went on and the amphibious forces got ready and then i sailed south with the which was full of para's and marines and the elk which was full of unbelievable amounts of ammunition so very good idea to stay about two miles away from her if someone dropped a bomb on her it was really going to go up with a big bang as i told their captain on one occasion when i went over and a couple of other ships and i took those down to the exclusion zone we then met up with the rest of the amphibious force and all the escorts then we met the carrier battle groups it was an amazing occasion you know two carriers plus all of the escorts i mean i've never seen really that number of ships apart from a very major nato exercise certainly not all british together in one spot we had sad incidence like the loss of a sea king with twenty two sas men onboard which went into the water about three miles from us in the pitch black no survivors apart from one of the pilots who as the plane went down and down and down he kicked out the windscreen which were armoured plated and to do that he smash both his ankles his legs and everything but it shows the genuine rush pitch black but he was recovered and he sort of wished he hadn't been in a way it wasn't his fault it was a bird strike then we went and had our talk about where we were going in when it was going to happen for the initial invasion and talk that through it was quite clear that my ship was going to be in a very exposed position because i had a longer ranged gun longer range enough to bombard darwin and goose green airfields to stop pucara's and those aircraft taking off and attacking us and so i led the amphibious force through into grantham sound and we was very lucky because going in the weather was absolutely ghastly that day very murky and misty and then it became night and of course it was night time when we went around the headland and down into the channel and then the next day of course brought dawn very very bright and clear and it brought to my thoughts because i'm a bit of an historian of crete very bright and clear and of course it was quite clear the main threat to us would be air attacks i started bombarding helping the special forces who were by goose green quite early in the morning and then carried on bombardments through the early part of the morning i destroyed a pucara taxiing on the airfield meanwhile the amphibious forces were going in san carlos water and we got the first sort of air attack by a pucara and a aermacchi on the force i suppose about three hours or so after sunrise we were all working at greenwich time and then we were aware the fast jets were all taking off from argentina and the first sort of attacks started i had an attack from a afour which dropped a bomb either side of me but didn't hit me caused a bit of damage to one of my aerials and then we had air attacks through that morning i'd really finished my task then of bombarding the airfield and i asked the commodore what he wanted me to do now and he asked me to split air attacks from the south so i moved across into the centre of the sound and to do that we had more air attacks through the lunchtime period and afternoon then there was a series of attacks primarily on me i was struck first of all by a five hundred two five hundred pound bombs from a navel argentinean navel afour they were the most accurate there air force seemed to keep missing which was quite handy and i steamed into wind at maximum speed which gave them a higher crossing rate and they hit me down aft blew off my sea cat launcher and caused some bad fires and blew out some of the torpedoes and that sort of thing and then of those three that attacked me those three argentinean navy ones we saw two were shot down by our harriers sadly after they dropped their bombs on me but anyway it was still quite good seeing them being shot down then we tried to get that under control which we managed to do i'd lost my missile system my gun i'd lost power to my gun and i was trying to restore power to the gun so effectively i only had twenty millimeter and gpmg as my armament we were attacked by some other aircraft my naffi manager who was manning the gpmg managed to put some bullets into the wing of one of the air force afour which these ones didn't manage to actually hit us and it therefore lost fuel and went back to port stanley rather than back to the argentinean mainland were the argentineans kindly shot it down for us so i said to my naffi manager you got it effectively sadly he's dead now which is sad one knows these things because once a ship is sunk everything's stuck in aspect and those are your people for ever and your always in contact with them i then had another attack with a number of the navy afours where i was hit by a number of bombs again two more of those were actually shot down by harriers again sadly after they'd hit me by that time i was very badly on fire and out of control my steering my aft steering had been hit and we were just running towards an island so i ordered the engines to be shut down i couldn't think of any other way of stopping us and to release an anchor so people ran up and released anchor and we stopped just short of the island and by then we had explosions aft and were very badly on fire i got the damage control officer and heads of department together to get a briefing of exactly what the position was we had another air attack from some daggers at that stage and we were sinking by the stern and they said they really couldn't do anything to stop what was happening there and so i very reluctantly gave the order to abandon ship and h m s yarmouth was nearby we had helicopters and so quiet a lot of people managed to get onto yarmouth and things like that once i'd made sure there was no one alive left on the ship i stepped of the bow because she was going down by the stern onto the yarmouth and that was that really as you were heading towards the falklands what was running through your mind as being in charge of the ship and did you know where you were headed and what were your feelings towards going into this conflict well i understood and knew my ship well i knew it was a very good ship we'd managed to win all sorts of trophies the fleet gunnery trophy asw we were very well worked up but equally i knew the prime threat that we would face would be fast jet air attack fighter ground attack and probably one of the least capable areas of my type of ship it was very good at surface to surface really quite good at asw but the thing it was worst at was close to land anti fighter ground attack aircraft meant you'd almost certainly have to use your secondary mode of fire and it was not very good at that so i knew this threat was really quite a significant threat i felt there would be a fight i sort of know what the spanish and argentineans are like they'd made this big bid they'd taken over the island they weren't going to go easily and i'd also flown up to northward two days before i sailed and i'd seen how much money the prime minister mrs thatcher had released from the contingency four and a half billion that day well when prime ministers release four and a half billion they intend to fight as well so i was pretty certain we were going to fight most of my ships company even though i told them we were going to didn't think we would without a doubt and i think that was true throughout the force they thought something would come up i was probably the only one in my ships company who had ever fought before i'd fought in aden but there hadn't been sort of naval war for a long time and so they hadn't fought so most thought there wouldn't be a war and it wasn't until the sheffield was struck by the exocet that people suddenly realised that this is for real and that defiantly had a dampening thing and a focus then of what had to be done but i exercised and practised this secondary modes and the way of doing anti aircraft fighting when we had the briefing about where we would go on going into the sound i realised i'd be very exposed and i was and i did say to the commodore i'm very exposed without any support there could i maybe have a combat air patrol over the top of me but it was impossible he had other things that were much more his priority by looking after the invasion force and those men but i realised how dangerous that would be i didn't then of course brief my people that that was the case i mean i was always very positive to them about what we could do and how well we do it you were a young commanding officer in charge of a enormous ship under constant attack what was running through your mind throughout that day as you were being continually hit by air attacks i think the main thing was to keep doing ones job early on it was to ensure bombardment after that it was too stop these air attacks getting to the amphibious ships it was a that aspect of it was a huge success the very thin line of escorts who suffered very badly actually that day because you know i was sunk brilliant was hit and damaged antrim was hit and damaged argonaut was hit and very badly damaged most of the ships actually were damaged but of the landing group five thousand men marines and para's the only people who were killed were a couple in a gazelle helicopter who were shot down so we successfully defended them and the amphibious shipping none of the amphibious shipping was hit huge success i mean the argentineans should of focused on that amphibious shipping should of tried to sink that but they had to come across us first and they got diverted by us once i was on fire that's why i had more attacks because i was a very obvious target if you imagine they were flying very low level they were scarred of the harriers soon as they saw something they went in and attacked it and so i drew quite a lot of attacks onto my ship and that was good but wasn't very pleasant and of course my mind shifted from really being able to do things to actually being able to save the ship and focus on that and i felt i was quite lucky in away because i had so much going through my mind i was able to concentrate on that i was impressed by some of the young men who didn't have all these things to think about you know a young man in a torpedo compartment on his own not very nice when that's going on and generally they performed very well one or two maybe didn't quite but the pressures on some people were quite awful and how much of a pressure did you feel on you as the ship caught fire and of the responsibility for your ships company well as captain you have total responsibility for all your people and you fall in love with your ship you know it's called your grey mistress and giving the order to abandon ship was extremely difficult very hard to do because i was weighing up could the ship actually be saved could it do something then and there after how many more of my people would be killed how many had been killed already how many were injured i think i'd lost twenty two killed by that stage and quite a lot injured and all of those things one was balancing up and its quite difficult you having to do it fairly quickly with a huge amount of noise going on and attacks going on and that was quite difficult and it was very hard and you know still one thinks to one's self oh gosh what if i'd done so and so what if i'd done this you know that's with you for the rest of your life and also with you for the rest of your life are your these boys you remember from that time you know one had to on the journey home i went to cambria initially and then to the qetwo after that my wife accuses me of cruising for the whole war but on the journey back on the qetwo i had to write letters to all the next of kin you know that was very hard and difficult i'd explained what had happened what had happened to their son and these were people i knew really well they were my people i looked after them that was my job to look after them so i felt a lot of guilt about that and thereafter after you've had the big seven nine week enquiry where they went through every single person where they were for the full twenty four hours before it what had they done i was quite a focused thing quite right it should be done because you got a lot of money and people's lives and that's quite difficult period to go through all of that at the end and then at the end of it you either get a court martial or you don't and i was fortunate enough because of how well my people had performed to get a distinguished service cross for gallantry for that thing thereafter as i say its stuck in aspect and i know all those families we have a reunion every year which is very well attended indeed and you never ever lose them you get christmas cards you get a letter from a young girl who her father had died explains to me about her boyfriend and should she get married to him and all this sort of thing you know forever you've got those people and it's a great honour you have but it's actually quite a burden as well but that's what happens you know could you just tell me what it's like being a ship under attack and being in charge of a ship that's under attack knowing sheffield had been attacked been hit wellbeing under fast jet attack when you're not that capable of being able to shoot them down because as i say because we were close to land are primary modes anti aircraft fighting which is using radars really didn't work and we had to do it in secondary is not very pleasant because you feel a certain vulnerability you're not able to get back at them in the way you'd really like to be able too so that was fairly unpleasant but as i say there are lots of other things to think about i think one of the amusing incidents was we were already on fire and people killed bodies around and people lying here and there and we were under attack by some more mirages and suddenly i was aware these were coming across the water firing cannon at us i was suddenly aware of someone by my side on the bridge and it was one of the stewards with a silver salve with a cup of tea on it and i sort of said well what are you doing i probably said it rather more forcibly than that he said well its tea time sir then he sort of looked out the window and there were these planes coming roaring towards and he went oh blimey and toddled off and i thought this is wonderful you know british will still have tea because its tea time which it was tea time it was about four o'clock which i thought was rather nice so there were incidents like that and people did brave things and i had one able seaman who was down aft which was very trashed because i steamed into wind most of the bombs kept hitting down aft which is why i had so few casualties twenty two dead could have been a lot worse than that but it was pretty awful down aft absolutely wrecked and on fire and he was in a space that was whipped out pretty well by a bomb completely wrecked everything collapsed down big red hot girders and everything all on fire an oil tank caught fire but also oil spilled into one of the water tanks where the top had been ripped off and had oil on top of it on fire and everyone was killed apart from him and a man enticknap who was trapped under an iron beam and had very bad damage to his head and lost fingers and things like that and this young boy a very young able seaman pulled him out from under there and then dragged him across and they had no way out they could see and then the ship sort of shifted slightly it was listing and air blew and there was a hole where the bomb had come in and he dragged this chap across and then enticknap fell in the water tank that was on fire and he jumped in after him and pulled him out and then he put his life jacket on enticknap and pushed him through the hole and then he jumped out afterwards and they were luckily picked up by a helicopter with a chap called rick jolly who was in it who didn't have a proper strop he was very strong and he managed to take them out one after the other to the helicopter so things like happened you know which one didn't find out about really until afterwards at the board of enquiry so a lot was going on and of course you're not aware of all of these things you're focused on trying to monitor keep the ship going and all these sorts of things how hard was it then to make the call to abandon ship well it was extremely difficult that's not instinctively what we do we don't do that and one had to weigh up will the ship survive is it going to sink anyway what capability had it got left what will it be able to do how many more people will die if i try and save it how many people will die if it can't be saved and there was these things going through my mind and there's a tendency to say we'll keep on going at it even though we'll sink and do it and one had to rationalise that and that's sort of very difficult thing that one has to wrestle with and there's no doubt i mean now there's a lot of talk about posttraumatic stress syndrome and it is very real and i think for some people effects them very badly but i mean i thought i got over this very quickly but certainly my wife said that i wasn't the same for about three four years then i did i wasn't aware of that but certainly every night for two or three years i would in the night be dreaming or be thinking about the events what i'd done what could i of done what should i have done and for some of the men it was much worse and you know everyone always feels a certain guilt and if they in their own mind put a certain guilt for something that happened that's very difficult to get rid of and it does have a huge impact on people which we didn't really realise at that stage i don't think and most people of course can get through it themselves i mean it's hard but they do and that's what happened in the second world war but there are some who can't and they do need help you were the last person onboard h m s ardent can you tell me what it was like having had all these attacks the ship was on fire it was sinking what were your last moments onboard the ship like well i went down onto the foc'sle and there was a couple of other people just going off before me and then i sort of thought i didn't want to leave her actually and then a couple of them came back and dragged me off and onto yarmouth because it was too much after commanding her for almost two years and her being my grey mistress my baby and my people being left on board there dead it was quite horrible actually were there times onboard h m s ardent when you were scared for your own life with all these air attacks going on i think at times one was scared when the planes turned in towards the ship and started firing cannon gun one felt quite a tightening in the stomach and when they released the bomb and you saw the bomb coming in you did duck down and then the bomb would go off and you'd get up again and get going again as so it was yes it was frightening but i think its lucky if you're in command or in a position of authority because you have so many people your responsible for your thinking more about them than thinking about yourself but i think if you're a little able seaman all on your own i think it must be terrifying and i think being on your own in a space is not very nice interestingly down in the engine room where it's very very noisy and they have ear defenders on they didn't have that same threat throughout the day because they were just getting on with their work they couldn't hear all this they heard the odd thump and bang and things but they weren't aware of it all and i think that was quite interesting in retrospect and having been through the enquiry afterwards what was it like to receive a distinguished service cross for your time on h m s ardent well it was a great honour and i thought it was a reflection really on how my people had performed sadly they can't all get one of these things but what the ship did it was very sad it was lost and what other ships did but what that ship did it did make the invasion possible with the other ships they all contributed to that and once the five thousand men were ashore and then over the next three days five thousand tons of equipment pretty well untouched by the argentineans it was a forgone conclusion we were going to win the only time they had a chance to stop us was if they stopped us landing and they didn't so it was an instrumental part of the success of that operation which was hugely successful and after all even for the argentine although they keep on rattling the sabre and saying it's the malvinas because they've been brought up like that forever it did mean that in the argentine they did changed from a very very nasty fascist dictatorship which oppressed and killed lots of their own population to a free democracy of the type it is now so actually it did a lot of good for them as well and certainly islanders in the falklands i've been back a number of times they never ever wanted to or saw themselves as part of the argentine and it was an appalling thing that someone invaded them and took them over and they are eternally grateful for what we did it's now quite a prosperous country with the fishing rights and things and of course now there's probably a problem coming up because of the oil exploration because if they find a lot of oil there this will be a difficulty i think as you stepped of the ardent for the last time did you look back at the ship what happened next i did yes i looked back at the ship and saw her on fire and exploded because the ship that picked us up then shot off up to cambria and i didn't actually see her finally go down but she exploded rather like antelope because of the big fires down aft and that was seen by a couple of other ships but you've probably saw the film footage of antelope blowing up that's actually what happened to ardent as well and then she sank and i've been back and laid a wreath on her and if the winds die down that's not very often in the falklands and its flat calm you can actually see her shape from helicopter until the wind from the rotors starts fluffing it up so you can just see her she's it about i suppose thirty feet of water or something her mast was just sticking up above sea level and h m s arrow when she did her bombardment for the goose green action used the mast and the position it was in as the reference point to do the bombardment so that helped as well so it was nice captain of arrow told me that as well what's it like when you've been back to the falklands when you reflect on what happened to ardent and the ships company what do you think about when you've been back well i'm very proud that it's now a prosperous and thriving place and that the people who live there were allowed to exercise their own right to how they were governed and who ruled them and the bottom line is they may be dancing on pinheads about what happened in eighteen twenty two or whatever it is certainly for nearly two hundred years it's been ex british people who have been living there falkland islanders the same families who absolutely wanted to stay part of britain and they had every right to do that and it's great to see them all thriving down there and one as you can imagine gets very well looked after those people were part of the force in nineteen eighty two are extremely well looked after there can you tell me since the falklands has there been any other times where you were perhaps fighting for your own life when you've been in the navy no not really i haven't been involved in combat since then i mean i've been out to iraq and out to afghanistan i was quite interested in one occasion in iraq when i went up to baghdad airport and it was a stage when they kept mortaring the airport and i was talking with an american general and a british general and suddenly lots of the people lots of sirens and people started rushing around trying to get into shelters and things like that and i said to the british general well what's going on and he said there mortaring the mortaring our airfield and i said well how big is the airfield extent and he said hundreds of acres i said well there pretty unlikely to hit something he said yes so we just sat there and drank are tea while all the rest shot off so there'd been things like that but hardly real threats only on certain visits one has to be quite well protected in the job i'd been doing and you know they run separate convoys and they'd been attacks on those but not really because i haven't been in combat operations but i've been in what you could call dangerous places for id's and things like that but very different that's very different you've spent a lot of time as i understand it after the falklands in charge of naval intelligence for the mod can you tell me a little bit about the gulf war one and what your role was there yes in the gulf war one i was the i ran the defence intelligence centre in the military of defence which was irksome because i'd loved to of been out there doing something but that's just one of those things and of course it was really important because the targeting and these sorts of things there was rather a lot of clever targeting tlam and for air strikes and things like that was very important and i remember i was on watch actually when the iraqis did that little foray down the coast down towards saudi arabia and that was quite an exciting period when that happened and i was able to watch the whole thing unfolding what was particularly interesting was one of course is privy to the fact the moment the thing is going to start and of course very few people are privy to that so i was actually at home and we had a dinner party and i knew the time this would happen and i thought well how quickly before in those days twenty four hour news wasn't quite what it was but cnn had started and i think this gulf war one actually made cnn effectively and i thought well it will take let me think cnn will pick it up probably about five to ten minutes after we've started all the huge attacks they'll know on the media so we were having the cheese coarse and i said there's something i just want to see on the television and i toddled into the other room and turned it on and sure enough about seven minutes later from the time they started reporting all the attacks so as the people came in from the dinner party i said ah well there you are then this is all happening they said you knew didn't you and i said well i don't know maybe i did i'm not sure so there was that sort of thing so that was interesting but it was festinating to watch all the intelligence picture being put together and the decisions for example by bush not to and bush and major not to go and follow the iraq's into iraq and one has to ask questions well was that the right thing it was certainly the right thing in terms of the un resolution but i do feel if we had gone and done that saddam would have collapsed at that stage and sadly we gave encouragement to the shia in the south particularly the marsh arabs and then we didn't support them and they were massacred i mean it was awful genocide effectively and now of course we have this libya thing makes it interesting to compare the two and of course because we didn't do that we ended up in another war and i'm not sure if that was right to invade iraq at that stage he was a ghastly man saddam i'm sure the worlds better not to have him but i think it's caused a lot of other difficulties when you're in a position of very high rank within the navy as you were and in charge of a lot of intelligence how frustrating is it when you think the government isn't making the right call on a big decision how much influence in retrospect do you think you had well i think when i was in the intelligence world and so for example particularly i was director in navy intelligence for three years earlier on and that was gulf war one time that was only as a commodore that was quite low rank really to be able to influence i couldn't really influence things i could put more intelligence up when i was chief of defence intelligence i was very much part of the chiefs of staff committee and the prime minister used to come along and others and therefore although i would put raw intelligence i did have an opportunity to try and impact on it a little bit but i wouldn't want to over emphasise in what is more important as an intelligence man is to give raw intelligence and so for example the air attacks on kosovo very heavy air attacks on the yugoslav army there did not have the impact that they were expecting they were very good at putting out dummies hiding weapons and things like that and it certainly wasn't going to make milosevic change his mind and collapse i was under lots of pressure to produce evidence of this was having a huge impact and i wouldn't and there's always a danger if you mess around with intelligence and one could see maybe examples of the iraqi time and you must not do that where one has more chance to influence things is when one becomes a chief of staff or a commanding chief certainly a chief of staff and then one fights ones corner and does ones best the trouble is if you don't win you either resign and that very seldom actually does very much or you have to begrudgingly except the corporate decision and that means then you've got to stick by it you can't say oh no and rattle away to the music and things one has a little bit of influence so i would like to think for example the getting the amphibious forces ready for the right flank invasion of iraq and the decision to go south i had a little bit to do with that and there were others who had more to do with it but that was very important because initially the plan was to go through turkey into the north and that would have been absolutely disastrous we would have been bogged down in the north of iraq with all the implications of that and the huge lines of communication it would of just of been stupid so with all the intelligence that you've seen over the years is there anything the public has a real misconception about is there anything we haven't read about that you think i'd like to be able to put them straight on that i think there are an awful lot of things that people don't know about and i think it's very dangerous to start trying to put people straight on secrets that's a very dangerous thing i think when i get very old if i live that long i might write something about it i've been asked and offered quite a lot of money to write when i left the navy in two thousand and six primarily about the iraq war and when i finished as security minister about my time as security minister but the people that offer you a lot of money for this thereafter salacious things that are nasty rather than the true historical perspective which is why if i survive long enough i'll write something when i'm older because i think it is right by that stage to maybe put your side of certain things which can be taken into the balance by historians into the future did you ever expect to become commander in chief of the fleet and then first sea lord no never i mean from day to day as a young officer i was a bit of a scaly wag when i was young had great fun i was always delighted i was still aloud to be there the next day and then you slowly become aware that you've got potential and capability and then when i had my first command as a young man which was h m s yarnton in hong kong i absolutely loved it i just revelled in it i found it the most fantastic thing moulding that group of people and getting to know them extremely well and achieving things with your unit and i thought gosh i'd love to do this on something a bit bigger and i then went back with new focus on things like my warfare course and advanced warfare course and things like that and threw myself into my job as an operations officer very hard work and some people and some people find it not particularly satisfying because you just go on and on and on but i at that stage thought if i do things well it's important anyway but i'll get there and i did i was lucky and got command of h m s ardent pretty well a brand new frigate only about three or four years old a real racing car of the ocean driving it was great fun i loved driving ships some people hate it but i love it and that's the mechanics of it you know and screaming alongside and doing stern boards and things and i was what thirty three i suppose when i got that which was quite young to be doing that and then you almost have a second career you have to go into the ministry of defence all very different writing lots of papers being a bit political very different from what you've done before and some people just hate it totally i found it quite a challenge and in a way enjoyed it i missed being at sea and i was delighted then when i went back to command bristol and have a squadron i was commanding you know that was exciting and good then i went into the intelligence world as you say got promoted then up to flag rank and i was really pleased to go as command of the uk battle group to do the proving exercise for permanent joint headquarters to run asw operations from mount whitney i had the record for holding down two soviet victor class submarines for the longest period with helicopters and with my nuclear submarine with all the assets i had and what was fascinating when i was first sea lord some years later and i visited murmansk at the invitation of the russian navy the northern fleet and when i'd been holding down these victors it was the soviet navy and it shows how times changed and i went to look at the breaking up of a number of their nuclear submarines which had been paid for by britain and america to get rid of them and to look after the nuclear reactors and there was one reactor on the jetty and bits of steel and it was one of the victor class submarines i'd held underwater those years before so one saw this incredible change to the world and i think one of the things that my generation of military don't recognise is effectively we won a war the cold war was a war different sort of war and we won it and thank goodness we did the world could have been destroyed eastern europe was absolutely under the yolk and here we are now in a different world and that was quite an achievement and it is sometimes under estimated i think history will show that that was an achievement because it wasn't a hot war people fighting in all directions although our submarines did some exciting things its sometimes forgotten can you tell me being first sea lord is there a typical day in that role what sort of things do you see coming across your desk what sort of variety of things are you dealing with there isn't really a typical day as a first sea lord i mean there's lots of variety which is what's so nice about it you're responsible for the fighting effectiveness and morale or your service and your chief of staff so firstly your responsible for the fighting effectiveness of the royal navy and its morale and that of course gives you a very wide remit and means you've got to look at all sorts of things and as well of controlling all the administrative staff in terms of logistics and supply and training and all these that have to be going well you need to get out and actually meet people see them talk to them get a feel for it you need mechanisms to give you feedback from lower down because people below you will tell you what they want you to hear and you need to be able to get more data than that so you got to be able to achieve that there is a political dimension in dealing with other chiefs of staff in the other services and dealing with politicians which is different from when ones more junior and that can be quiet difficult you know politicians have quite a difficult job but there corkscrews as well and that is quite hard to plain speaking sailors so that's quite tricky i suppose one of the things lots of visits you need to visit other navies other nations i visited fifty different countries that's different countries in my time as first sea lord now some of those countries i visited a number of times like afghanistan iraq france things like that but i had fifty different ones gives a flavour for the number of visits you do and visits out to see your ships to see your establishments to meet your people you know they need to see you when i was commander in chief my motto was fight and fun and fight was meant all aspects of the ability of the navy to fight which of course includes all of its administration its logistics training all of these things and the fun bit was because if you don't have fun and enjoy what you're doing i mean i think it's the same in anything and i don't mean everyone is roaring with laughter all the time it's not very pleasant when your sunk for example but if you can't have some enjoyment out of what you're doing then life's a pretty dull place and that was my motto and that's why i try to inspire with people and i wanted to get the nation to understand again how important the navy is because we have a certain sea blindness within this country i think it's because we take it for granted and part of the whole bicentennial for nelson part of that was to achieve that and a basically i was told by the government well you're not having any money to do this you know this by bicentennial you no its not and so what i did was i found some money in my recruiting budget and i said this will justify it to myself by saying well obviously it will help with recruiting that allowed me then to kick start something i then invited a mass of nations from around the world all of who responded and said they were coming and i then set up a team and they also got money from donations from the british public which amounted to several million and we ended up with this huge fleet review which was a gigantic success the big firework display and because of course it was donations it meant the heavy hand of the civil service couldn't stop things so for example the grand firework night on the last night of it cost one eight million pounds now you couldn't of justified public money but as it was given by the british public there entitled to see their fireworks and so things like that were rather good you told me earlier you lead the response after the nine eleven attacks on america what was the feeling like within the mod and within the navy at that time how much of a threat was the uk under that we might not know about well i think everyone was pretty shocked by the twin towers i mean it was a huge belt and what became clear was that a lot of this threat which clearly was a greater threat that maybe we appreciated it wasn't well articulated in our country was coming from afghanistan i think across the navy most people didn't realise that there were huge training camps there didn't realise there were lots of laboratories there and these sorts of things and indeed i didn't think even the intelligence people didn't realise the extent of them until we went in there but i think the thought of going and hitting were these terrorists came from who were clearly going out in the world and attacking us and let's be clear the nine eleven happened but before that there'd been an attempted attack on the centre of birmingham by al qaeda terrorists which had been stopped by the security service and police but it was not well publicised and these things were kept quiet so i think they felt it was appropriate this should happen and what i lead of course was the navel response to this and what i'd done was arranged a big training exercise called safe soria to take place in the middle east because i thought the next place there would be trouble because it was quite clear from what was going on would be in that sort of region and that exercise was underway when the twin towers happened and things and of course they were very well placed to be able to do something and a lot of assets moved from that to afghanistan and the illustrious filled herself up with chinooks i think she carried eight or nine which is absolutely full up and special forces and conducted special forces operations across pakistan which were really quite amazing and the three commando brigade was the british first land response apart from sf into country and that brigade went in there and i flew in when they flew in there prior to them going off on their first operations on the snow line against the taliban and so it was quite an exciting time and three commando brigade and the navy were able to do this even though afghanistan was a land locked country it showed that flexibility which i was very proud of and of course all the forces involved did extremely well i think it's quite well documented that you said earlier you thought the invasion of iraq was an error can i ask a bit more about that and how frustrating it was being part of the mod at the time and not agreeing with the decision well initially i was commander in chief and in about june july of a i'm trying to get my years clear two thousand and two i think it was i became very aware that we were going to invade iraq when i now try to think about why was i so aware its quite tricky to think about but i was and i know i was because i said right to the fleet the fleet is to be in all respects ready to conduct war operations in the northern gulf by december of this year and i told the marine commandos to get themselves up to full full kit and all this sort of thing and i realised we'd need mcm vessels out there because in the first gulf war mines had been a problem and it takes time to get them out and acclimatised so i arranged for them to sail from the uk an msm squadron in august and the way i justified it was i said they were doing exercises all the way out there and so of course they sailed and were all out there ready for the war when the war started now i wouldn't of done that i wouldn't of woken up in my bath and said umm let's get the navy ready for war against iraq so i was defiantly told and actually if you look it fits in with the talks between our prime minister and the president of the united states at camp david and so i'm sure i was told post that by somebody this was going to happen now it then became a little bit more clever with the use of words about well maybe we will maybe we need to get a un resolution but i was quite clear in my mind that it was going to happen and i was quite glad i'd done what i did because when we went in in two thousand and three by then i'd become first sea lord it meant the navy did have all its kit the army were desperately trying to get desert boots and desert kit and all this sort of stuff because they hadn't been allowed to do a bulk order because it would of meant they would have been going to war i'd actually told my lot to do it and we done it and in fact my marines lent the army an awful lot of stuff out there because i had the amphibious force there and my ships were ready and all fully stocked up and ready to go my mcmvs were there and we really lead the right flank of the invasion if iraq now i think generally invading people is a bad idea it was difficult with saddam because we had a no fly zone and he would regularly shoot at our aircraft and things and there would of come an occasion when one was shot down and one sort of wondered what an earth did we do to this man because sanctions were impacting on his children and it was causing a lot of upset so it was difficult situation but i wasn't sure there was enough there to invade him then i was aware of the rhetoric about weapons of mass destruction i thought well this is an excuse then for war because i was sure he had some chemical weapons not very many because i'd been chief of defence intelligence i knew what he had had i knew what he wanted to do but i was quite clear he didn't have a nuclear program he wanted to have one but he didn't because we dismantled it and destroyed it with the israelis his biological program we dismantled at the beginning of the nineties and of course it's easy to start one again but there was no indication that he'd got one going properly he might have had the odd tube of nasty bugs but not a proper program he'd been doing a ballistic missile program we knew that to get longer range ballistic missiles but they weren't yet capable of carrying anything really nasty and of course he had his chemical program were i did think he had some chemical shells because he had had a lot of them so i thought there would be some of those and i thought this is just an excuse to do it and as i say generally it's not a good idea to invade people the invasion of afghanistan was correct they'd attacked us huge training camps we should have gone in there knocked them about which we did then got out which we didn't do that was a mistake iraq i don't believe we should of invaded them but the decision had been made i was absolutely focused on the royal navy playing its full part and doing it properly and i first of all although the attorney general said it was legal because we had pushed the cds the three chiefs pushed the cds to check if you remember and he did say that i went and got separate legal advice to tell me it was legal because i wasn't going to have my sailors and marines doing things that were illegal in international law that advice also said it was legal although the firm that advised me said it was quite close and we'd love to represent you afterwards because it could go on for years but anyway that was their view and then are part in the invasion was to hold the right flank which was mainly an amphibious operation on the alfor using amphibious forces helicopters shore bombardment from a number of our ships and that went seamlessly went brilliantly and we moved on up and took the eastern part of basra the army were following the american army in and then they had there bit of fighting up by basra so i was very proud of what we did of that initial invasion but no one really had thought through of what then happened we asked at the chief of staff meeting what about phase four that's the aftermath that was called phase four at that stage and we were told the americans had that all in hand which was not a good bases to go on and do it and of course they dismantled the army and got rid of the bath party and we know what happened it was a disaster the actual invasion went brilliantly the navy part in it was brilliant i'm very proud of what our people did there after it became a real mess looking back on your career in the navy do you have a proudest moment it's very difficult because you have pride the pride you get as you get older relates to things that have happened all through your career in the past and the fact you belong to this amazing organisation so i was hugely proud of my people in h m s ardent you know fighting there hugely proud of them but one felt a huge boost of pride when for example i was standing next to her majesty do the review of the fleet for the bicentenary in two thousand and two onboard h m s endurance leading a column of ships around this vast assembly of ships and i felt pride then for what the navy had achieved over well through its history but certainly in my forty years of being in the navy and part of it as i mentioned the cold war was a huge victory for all of our military and the military's of nato and the navy played a gigantic part in that and i was proud of the things that the navy had done while i'd been in it you know it had done very well in that invasion of iraq no matter how much one might think it was a flawed thing it had done very well it had done very well in the invasion of afghanistan it was very important in sierra leone were actually we stopped a huge massacre of people there the navy was crucial for that and one had example after example of where it had done and achieved things and i've seen that happening around the world ranging from disaster relief right up to hot war and one feels that pride at certain moments and that was one of the moments i felt it one would feel great pride when i having been ashore for a while i remember joining bristol i did a pier head jump to take her over in the united states from admiral white he was a captain who just become admiral and sailing out on that first day into a big rolling ocean atlantic swell knowing that was based on your career before that and being part of this wonderful organisation you feel pride at all of those moments really leaving the navy and entering politics the house of lords and as security minister what was that transition like how does life as security minister compare to a life in the navy well when i finished as first sea lord i initially one takes a deep breath and its quite a shock not to be in an active job although one is still on the active list in the navy if you're a chief of staff because in the old days one would have been an admiral of the fleet having done that but that rank was put in abeyance in nineteen ninety seven but the post of first sea lord stays on the active list and can still fly his flag can still wear his uniform can still do a whole raft of things that still happen so i'm still on the active list but you're not doing a job with the navy and i thought well i go and do some things in the commercial world which i slowly did and collected them and found how much people earn in the commercial world which was quite nice and i was just getting settled into that when the prime minister asked me if i would join his government he was very worried about the threat from terrorism he showed me the latest threat my initial response when he just asked me to join i just said no not for me really i'm quite happy where i am i'm not a politician he then came back to me again and said look please i'd really like you to do this you know and he said you'd get a place in the house of lords which of course is a great honour but i'd been a knight twice already so i wasn't over fused about that and he said you know you could live in albany house well i'd lived in albany house for twelve years so i wasn't to fussed about that either so i still didn't really want to do it and then he asked me to come into number ten to talk to him and he showed me the latest threat assessment which was very very bad and he said what did i think of that and i said i was quite shocked because the last i'd seen had been some fourteen months before when i finished as first and he said well i'd like you to help make the country safer and i said well i think there are probably people better placed than me to do it he said i don't know them so i'm asking you as prime minister of great britain and ireland would you join my government as security minister and help make the country safer well its quite difficult at that stage to say no let the bastards die isn't it so i said of course i will and i joined the government and it's different being a politician i was lucky in that i'm not a pure politician and everyone knew that that made life a lot easier i did know a lot about intelligence and security and military issues and so that helped me i unlike most politicians i'm not being rude i actually understood what i was the areas i was working in i knew more about than most of the civil servants and that's very unusual because politicians don't normally do that which again is quite useful i was given by gordon brown to be fair to him quite a free rein to do things and he put money into that area and that always helps as well so i think over the three years i was almost doing it for three years i was actually able to make the country safer not safe sadly because there was still a huge threat but safer so i feel proud of what i did then i'm pleased and i feel very proud that a naval officer an admiral was actually doing that and it was quite nice to have another admiral in the house of lords because when there are defence debates and things one could have a maritime perspective which is useful so all in all it was a good experience it did mean one stopped earning money again really you know it was quite a dramatic drop than what one had but money is not the key driver in life there are things that are much more important and now i've finished that i'm out sort of getting the odd job here and there and doing this and that so it keeps one busy where do you see the navy of the future going in the next fifteen years or so what would you like to see perhaps being done differently if you were still in position as first sea lord well i suppose the thing i find saddest at the moment is that the government this government and indeed all governments seem to say it that the prime and most important responsibility of any government is the security of the nation and the security of british people overseas if you say that then that means it surly must be the top of the priorities for spending but one does not actually see that and now i know defence is not a vote winner it's only a vote winner when your actually in a big war and whilst the british public love their sailors soldiers and airman they hate the thought of them being killed in afghanistan they actually are unwilling to see money going from the national health service and other things into defence and that is unfortunate because we need more money in defence i believe we need global reach and of course the force that does that is the navy and there's no doubt the navy compared with navy i joined in nineteen sixty five has been really hit in terms of resources and size it is nothing like the navy it was then it's still very capable but very small it's almost to small i think the twenty twenty vision of having the two big air craft carriers with proper air wings and amphibious forces that's great but that's jam tomorrow and i'm very worried about this next ten years and i think the current first sea lord has a real difficulty in fighting for resources and things and i think the nation will regret it if it forgets it's a maritime power and a maritime nation and i fear we will live to regret that when are nation has forgotten that it has always suffered and that worried me and i love the navy and i love britain and i think the two are totally intertwined and that's very important
