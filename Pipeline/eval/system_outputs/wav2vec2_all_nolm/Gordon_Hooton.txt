COMPASS LIKE WHERE YOU SEE THE ILE ANDS GO OU YOU GOT NUMBERS FLICKING BACKWARD AND FORWARD AND YOU ON READ THEM AND ER BUT WE DID HAVE ONE IN THE OLD ONE WHAT ABOUT THIS SHIP THE JAPANESE SHIP YOU WERE ESCORTING TELL ME ABOUT THAT YEAH WELL ER THAT WAS THE BIGGEST OF THEIR CREISE I KEPT THINKING AND DON'T ASK ME THER NAME I CAN'T TELL YOU BUT IT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE THEY HAD THAT HAT HAD AND SHEAD BEEN BOMBED AND SHE LAY IN THE HARBOURWE USED TO GOOD BY ER EVERY TIME WE WENT IN AND OUT BUT WE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON THE BOTTOM BUT SHE WASN'T BUT ANYWAY IT WAS THE BIES ONE OF THE JAPANESE SHIPS AND IT HAD BEEN BOMBED AND IT HAD BEEN IN SINGAPORE HARBOUR FOR QUITE SOME TIME SINCE IT WAS HIT ANYWAY ON MINO A NE THEY WERE MAKING IT READY TO TOW IT AND SINK IT YOU SEE AND WE GOT JOSE TO DO IT AND WE WERE COMING ON OUR WAY HOME AS IT HAPPENED AND IT WE LEFT SINGAPORE WITH HER WITH THE TOG WEATHER TO TOK WITH HER ACTUALLY AN ER SHE WAS A MASSIVE SHIP AND SHE'D BEEN EMPTIED IN EVERYTHING AND IT GOT DARK AND WEWERE COMING UP THE MALACA STRAIGHTS AND WE GOT TO THIS POINT WHERE WE SHE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN SUNK THE DEEPEST WATER CAUS SHE WAS THE BIGGEST ONE THEY HAD AT THE TIME AND ER CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS PITCH BLACK AND WE WERE ON OUR WAY COMING TO COME HOME YOU SEE IT COME TO MIDNIGHT AND ER O TWO JAPANESE TOGS WERE TOWING HER THEYAD BEEN TOWING HE ROYED OUT ON AIR WELL AS FAR AWAY FROM US FURTHER THAN THAT THEIR BIG AV THERE THEY WERE FROM US BUT THEY WERE COMING UP AGAIN THE COAST LINE AND WE WERE FURTHER OUT WHERE WE COULD KEEP OUR EYE ON EVERYTHING AND AS I SAY IT GOT PITCH BLACK AND BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE POINT WHICH WE HAD A COMPUSS READING WHEE GOT A SINKA ON THEY STARTED THE SHIP COMING UP AND LEFT HER THEY BOLTED AND LEFT THE SHIP WITH NO HEADWAY AND SHE'D COME HALFWAY UP NEARLY TO WHERE SHEPLOSED HAD BEING SUNK AND I EXPECT I DON'T KNOW WHATEER AIR CAPTAIN GOT PERMISSION TO SINK HER BUT IT WAS MIDNIGHT PITCH BLACK AND WE HAD AIR SEARCH LIGHT ON HER AND THEY VANISHED INTO THE BLACK AND GONE OF COURSE SHES DRIFTED SWELL SHE WOULDN'T DRIFT FUTYOU KNOW I MEAN SHE'S A MASSIVE SHIP BUT SHE WAS ONLY JUST OFF THE COAST LINE AS WE THOUGHT PITCH BLACK AND I'M STILL ON THE BLOODY WHEEL I AM OF COURSELOOKING AT THE WHEERLEGS WELL CAUSE WE WEREN'T GOING WE WERE JUST ABORRY AND WE I SUPPOSE THE CAPTAIN GOT IN TOUCH WITH AIR PEOPLE AND THEY SAID WHAT TO DO SO WE HAD TO SEND MEN OVER WITH DEPTH CHARGES CAUSE WE CARRIED DEPTH CHARGES AND THEY GOT TO PUT THE DEPTH CHARGES AS LOW AS POSSIBLE IN THE SHIP CAUSE THERE WAS NO BODY ON THERE AND I MEAN IT WERE MASSIVE AND THEYD GOT TO WIRE EVERYTHING UP AND ALL WE COULD DO WAS USE THEIR DEPTH CHARGES AND ER AND TRY THEM THAT'S IT THA WES ALL WE COULD DO WELL WE DID WE DID IT IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN WE STARTED AND WE WERE DRIFTING A SPUR AWAY PERHAPS AS THE SPIRST ELS FROM HER AND ER COURSE YOU COULDN'T DO MUCH REALLY BCAUSE OUR AIR MOTORBOAT WENT OVER AND THEY TOOK I THINK THEY PUT FOUR DEPTH CHARGES IN HER IN THE MOTORBOAT AND E THAT'S ALL SHE D HOLD YOU SEE CARRY AND SO THEY TOOK THEM OVER FROM OFF OF US THEY WERE OUR CREW YOU SEE DOING IT AND WHATEVER THEY'D DONE THEY WENT ABOARD THE SHIP AND THEY TOOK THESE DEPTH CHARGES AS THE CAPTAIN HAD SAID S GOT TO BE DONE AND PUT THEM RIGHT DOWN IN THE LOWER END AS THEY COULD GET O THE SHIP COUSE I MEAN SHE WAS A BLOODY MASSIVE THING AND ERM THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD AND FOSED EVERYTHING BAT WOULD EXPLODE AND CAME BACK TO US AND BANG SHE DID SHE WENT DON AND BLEW THE BOTTOM OUT AND SHE WENT DOWN OF COURSE WE NEVER SEE ER KNO MORE CAUSE WE LEFT HER THERE WHETHER SHE SHE WERN'T TOO FAR OFF THE COAST AND SHE WASN'T TOO FUR FROM PINANG SHIP WASNT WE WERE GOING UP TOWARDS PINANG AND ER DID YOU SEE HER GOING DOWN THEN OH YEAH WE WATCHED HER WITH ER SEARCH LIGHT YEAH THE ONLY SPECIAL THING TO SEA YEAH WELL WE ONLY ON UTIL WE SEE HER MORE OR LESS THE THE MAST WAS STICKING OUT OSING THAT'S ALL BUT SHE 'S STILL GOING SHE WAS STILL GOING DOWN SHE SE PITCHED AIR MEN PUT DEPTH CHARGES ALL THE WAY ALONG SO WHEN SHE GOT TO CERTAIN DEPTH THAYD OPENED THE DEPTH YOU KNOW THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP TO LET THE WATER IN AS YOU DO AND WE HAD TO SIT THERE UNTIL IT FILLED UP AND FIRED THESE CHARGES AN OH W BLOODY YOU NEVER SHOUT LIKE IT IT WAS FABULOUS BUT OF COURSE YOE WASN'T TO LEAVE HEIR CAMERAS SO A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD MIND SWEEP YOU KNOW A STORY ABOUTWHAT YOU DO HOW YOU DO IT OH WELL THERE'S VARIOUS WAYS YOU CAN DO IT YOU CAN DO IT WITH TE WIRES OUT WITH FLOATS ON ERM OR THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN PUT DEPTHS DOWN PUT THEM DOWN TO CERTAIN DEPTHS AND LEAVE THEM DOWN THERE WAIGHTING THEM DOWN IT DEPENDS WHAT'S GOIN TO BE THERE OVER THEM AND THAT WHEN YOU COME BACK BUT BASICALLY YOU ONLY DO IT TO CLEAR THE OCEAN IN THE AIRA YOU'RE IN AND IF THERE'S BEEN SHIPS COLLODING WITH THEM YOUWED GET SUNK OUT WE'D GET SENT OUT THERE TO SWEEP IT YOU HAVE ANY MER MISSES WITH THE MINES WELL WE'VE HAD THEM COME UP BESIDE US YEAH HAD TIME O TWO BUT WHEN YOUWERE ALL JOINED TOGETHER WE WARD GREAT STRONG WARRIERS YOUWERE IN A FORMATION LIKE THAT AND EACH SIDE BE GOES OUT TO ANOTHER SHIP AND THEN THEY GO OUT TO ANOTHER ONE AND THEN OUT TO THE OTHER THEN YOU GOT SEVEN BUT YOU'RE THE ONE IN THE FRONT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOT PROBABLY MORE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU CAN SOUND THAN THE OTHERS O SAY THEY DO THAT SORT OF THING THEY KEEP IMPROVING ON CERTAIN THINGS AND WE MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER I DON'T KNOW BUT ERTHAT'S HOW YOU SWEEP THAT SWEEP YOU'RE ALL OVERLATCH EACH OTHER AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY TIGH YOUE ACTUALLY GOT WIRES HOLDING YOU TOGETHER IN A POSITION NO NO NO IT'S ALL DONE FREE THEY BRINK THEY HAVE TO SET THERE ON EACH SIDE OF YOU AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE AND THEN VOSE EVERSEY FOR THE NEXT TO AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT THAT'S WHEN YOU DO THAT TYPE OF SWEEP BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAVES YOU CAN SWEEP AND ER SOM WE USED TO DO SWIPES SWEEPS WITH E LONG WIRES WE HAD A GREAT BIG THING ON AIR QUARTER DECK AND IT WAS FULL OF HEAVY WIRE AND WE USED TO LET THAT OUT WITH THINGS ON THAT YOU KNOW AND ER CAPTAIN ON THE BRIDGE HE SA LET GO THEN YOU STOP IT WHEN HE TELLS YOU COULD T SOME MASSIVE SSACK OF WIRE ON A DRUM AND IT'S NOT HEAVY WIRE BUT ER YOU PUT ANYTHING ON THE END OF IT YOU SEE AND YOU COULDNT LET IT OUT AND IFIT WILL EXPLODE MINES ORIT'LL FIND IT IF THERE'S ANY THERE YOU'LL KNOW WHERE YOU STAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER IF YO IT'S ALL DONE ON LOCK REALLY S YOU CAN'T LOOK DOWN IN THE SEA BUT WE USED TO SNAG UP AN WE SNAGGED UP ON AN AIRPLANE DOWN THERE THAT HAD CRASHED AND ER WELL SO WE WERE TOLD IT WER I DON'T KNOW I NEVER SEEN IT BUT I KNOW WHEN IT SNAGGED IT AND IT GOT ROUND THE SHIP BUT IT WAS A PLANE BUT I DON'T KNOWHOW THEY KNEWCOUSE WE DIDN'T STOP BUT YOU ALWAYS GOT SOMEBODY THAT MADE SOMETHING UP DIDN'T YOU
