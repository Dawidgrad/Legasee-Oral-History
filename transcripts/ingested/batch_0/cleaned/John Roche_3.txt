talk a bit about what you were doing during this period when i commissioned the ship you've all got your various acting stations and your normal workstations there were usually four parts to a ship the front end of the ships there was the main top on one side and a four top on the other side and that would be the mid ship part of the ship and then you had the quarter deck was the after end of the ships and i was in the quarter deck so you all had your own part of the ship as it were you all had your acting stations there and your normal workstations my first station was the transmission station we were down about three decks with big hatches closed down on top of us so if the ship disappeared we would be gone as well what was you doing down there in the transmitting station in the transmission station they would have a range finder fitted on the master and the range finder would be transmitting down the distances of targets whether that would be aircraft or ships and we had a transmitter it was like an old type of computer we followed dials and had to line them up and we were in contact with the gun and all the feed that we put into it the guns followed our instructions so if you was firing a four five gun at an aircraft we would transmit the height the bearing and all of that sort of thing or if it was on a surface target you'd transmit the range and all that sort of thing it was a type of computer i suppose if you like that's when you closed up and went to your action stations you either ended up in two watches port or starboard if you were in cruising stations or you would normally be in three watches you had a red white and a blue watch so you'd be four on and eight off or sometimes if you were on a more action routine sometimes you could be four on and four off so it was pretty strenuous it all depended on where you were and what the danger was you might have been there all night maybe all day it all depends on where the ship was and what the danger was what was it like down there when the fifteen pounders were going off well you could hear them thumping away all the time every time they fired there was a tonne projector one would weigh a tonne they had to be loaded we had six fifteen each guns so twelve tonne at a time going out and when the ammunition was shipped one had to come on at a time because they did weigh a tonne each and they went down to the shell room and the cordite in another the magazine so you had the shells in one room and the cordite in the other so if you got hit in action you can say cheerio you were on your way
