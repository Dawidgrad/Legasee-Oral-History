my name is baden singleton i was born september twenty seventh nineteen twenty four and i was brought up in in dorset i went to lulworth school until i was fourteen two and a half mile trek to school and when i was fourteen because my father died when i was seven i had to get out and get some work because we were brought up on the parish and i got this job in domestic service three male servants and three each kitchen and house maids quite a happy household really i was there until i joined the navy i was glad to get out of there because i was on my own i was doing the butlering side of it just me you know anyway i joined the rn at seventeen and a half to go and stand guard on the camps i did my training at gosport in a new barracks gosport at six weeks disciplinary and rough outline of naval the i went to camp six months i was there standing guard and then from there too general service training at collingwood were you a volunteer for the navy was this something you really wanted to do yes right from a youngster i found a seaman's hat on the beach and it fascinated me i had tried as a boy to get into the navy and i couldn't i got two retracted ribs not even the merchant navy would take me but when the war came they didn't notice that they accept anyone i suppose anyway from gosport too collingwood and i really can't remember how many we did the full training there quite strict we had a old retired po in charge of our class and he didn't want to come back in and he let us know at every opportunity he was quite a character he said if it wasn't for you lot i could be at home sitting in my arm chair spitting on the ceiling' that was his favorite you see and during the training in collingwood the roads weren't that wide and you're marching in a squad and there is a squad coming from the other direction he would ask you what do you do ' and we would sort of move over but not him straight through he said march over them you know we had that sort of training it was all new to us end of training it was just a batch draft from collingwood to lowestoft a batch of us so you had no choice about it no no we were just seaman we don't have choices so what happened when you got to lowestoft yes we were happy it was a wet day a miserable night we got there dark and of course they have no barracks and you were billeted in the town it was much too late for us to be billeted so the main area was a concert hall that was part of this place in lowestoft they took over it was a big concert hall with a stage and what have you anyway we just spent the night on this floor how you could you know you just laid down and went to sleep we were tired enough and in the morning we went round with a lorry and you would drop off here and drop off there and i finished up at the south end of lowestoft hatfield quite a long way from the base but then we had free bus transport so so you were in digs basically you were billeted out yeah and i was billeted with a fishing skipper and he was very strict but a nice old chap you know and the failing i had with that is he insisted on making yorkshire pudding in a basin and we had to eat it you could not leave it unless you had a pocket which very often happened you know you must not leave this yorkshire pudding but he was a great chap meeting down the pub and buy him a drink he was your mate all through the war and service i was seaman and a seaman in a minesweeper you deepening in how many watches the first ship i was on we only had six seaman so that meant we did four hours on and four hours off all the time we were at sea which could be quite a long time and quite tiring and of course your watches change at the dog watch which is six until eight yes six until eight i had to think then anyway you know if you were close to the dogs just come off and wanted to sleep you lost it because you stood too dawn and dusk you always everyone was up you see and we had an hour and twenty minutes on each post this was on the bridge lookout hour and twenty minutes at the wheel and an hour and twenty minutes on the aft gun lookout the aft gun lookout made the cocoa for the next watch when we were in harbour you would paint and get stores in you know all manual jobs i suppose and at sea scrubbing the decks at sea that's all you did a sweeper takes in a lot of water she is not like a big liner and you couldn't do much on the deck if she's a bit choppy not much you could do actually so you're just watch keeping or sleeping you didn't do anything between on the second ship the wolborough we had nine seaman so we had three hours on and four four hours on and eight hours off accept for the dogs and then you lost a bit my first trip out was on romeo and at the time we set off i was pumping water from the main tank to the heads up top and i'm pumping away you see and the ship poked her head outside down a trough up a trough down and over the sides and that was it no more i lost what i had then and went back to pumping the water quite happy the only time i was ever sick again was off bengasi we were at anchor and the heat was terrible no air at all and there was a heavy swell and you know i was sick again just the once i got rid of it i was alright but that's the only times the ships i was on were escort we were asdic sweeps and radar so you were detecting mines not mines no submarines detecting submarines if there was any mines we would find them no it was subs we looked for and if you actually got a contact then what did you do nobody was handed to the bigger escorts but if in some circumstance we had to drop our own thigimies depth charges depth charges yeah but you know we only do twelve knots if we could race about whereas our flotilla leader was a frigate and they could move a bit faster corvettes they did even there was another one a south african whaler was part of our escort off hand i could never remember the names of the ships or how many we had a fair flotilla
