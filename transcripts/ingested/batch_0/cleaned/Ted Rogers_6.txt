what was it like when you were out in an atlantic convoy and you could see these u boats prowling around you you could see them astern during the day on the surface but there was nothing you could do about it if the escort say you have four corvettes and you've got thirty merchant ships and then you've got twelve submarines armed following on behind you what can you do you just wait for your death that was the great difficulty then sometimes they'd give the order to scatter you know the convoy to split up and go each your own way we did that on one convoy because we were the fastest ship some of the ships were only going eight knots and the speed of the convoy was that of the slowest ship you see and you were sitting ducks in a way and so when it got very bad in some areas sometimes the commodore would say the only thing is to split up each go your own way we're going to lose some ships but if we stay together we might lose more it was a matter of balancing that out you know on one of the arctic convoys that was a disaster when they did that did they give you the you mentioned about being told to scatter was that an atlantic convoy yes an atlantic convoy yes then we went from there because we weren't a very fast ship but we were one of the fastest ships what a bout camaraderie just talk a bit about were you always with the same apprentices that you started with or was it always different on every ship sometimes you might be with the same people on the next ship not necessarily i mean i was with one particular captain two or three trips but normally it was changed because when you went home of leave they'd re allocate people to different ships you know but there was a very good friendship amongst the crew that was really good you know and the solidarity people were willing to stick together and do what they could you know so that was very positive actually there's a man in birmingham who was on the same ship with me he was the cook now i didn't know that he was on this until he saw me on the songs of praise' and he picked that up and got me he rang me up i didn't remember his name because we had only been on the ship a couple of weeks before we were sunk i didn't know everybody but now he's in fairly regular contact with me and he's retired he's a bit older than me where does he live birmingham i wouldn't mind interviewing him i'll give you his name and address when we finish up were you ever torpedoed again no some people were torpedoed several times i mean some people we picked up had been in an oil tanker and they saw the torpedo they were on the gun platform which was at the stern because it was defensive and they saw the torpedoes coming and on a petrol tanker they knew what would happen so they jumped in the water straight away and the ship went on the torpedoes hit it the boats were lowered the sea was on fire everybody in the boats was burned those were the only two that were saved and then they had already been torpedoed on another ship so some people had two or three sinkings were there any unusual cargoes that you carried well we often carried mixed cargoes and even in going down to italy for instance in addition to sherman tanks we had food supplies we had railway lines because the railways had been devastated in italy and they had to lay new tracks you see i remember those vividly because one of them slipped out of the sling when we were unloading them and one of the cadets i was third mate there one of the cadets was down at the hull and it hit him on the foot and his foot was bleeding and we had to carry him off to shore i remember that quite vividly you carried a very general cargo transport and ammunition and war supplies whatever was needed and then this was allocated by the ministry of transport some ships would have this and some ships would have the other you know i was quite amazed in new york when we loaded these sherman tanks because they put general cargo down below first and then they came in and laid a sort of dance floor beautiful wood right throughout over the other cargo we wondered what was going on because this was done by the dockers there and then they loaded these tanks and then they pulled them sideways on this floor because they put grease down and then they pulled them sideways with the winch you see so you could pack more in it was very very clever who was in charge of the loading of the ships who has that job well that was done in port normally by the stevedores but in some foreign ports it was done under the supervision of the ship itself we had to use our own derricks and cranes especially in west africa where we used to go quite a lot because there weren't the facilities there we were going up some of the creeks in west africa ninety miles inland up to sepali and then you tie up to a big tree incredible
