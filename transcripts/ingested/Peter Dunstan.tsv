1	0 days 01:00:01		 My name is Peter George Dunstan, I was born on the top of Hampstead Heath within the sound of bow bells where Dick Whittington is supposed to of turned and gone back as Lord Mayor of London. I revolted against my father who wanted me to be an electrical engineer and I went and did a short time as a blacksmiths assistant helping to shoe great big cart horses until the war came and I knew through my height I was destined for the Guards so I joined the Royal Marines instead. 
2	0 days 01:00:45		 Can you remember much about your training when you decided to become a Royal Marine and did you know what you were in store for? 
3	0 days 01:00:51		 Oh god yes… we were told to report to the recruiting office which was just by Trafalgar Square and about twenty of us civilians had to report to the Royal Marine recruiting office that morning we were marched… or we weren’t marched we were just walked to Charing Cross Station and from Charing Cross Station down to Deal and to the Royal Marine training barracks in Deal itself for the first two days it wasn’t so bad but then we were destined for the Adjutant who called us the scruffiest lot of recruits that ever walked into the barracks and destined for training and at Deal and at Kingsdown which was the training camp firing range where we did our training and then having finished our training we were destined to Plymouth which was to be our depot. There were at that time there were three Royal Marine Depots Plymouth, Portsmouth and Chatham and by our regimental number which was PLY which was Plymouth that was our depot 
4	0 days 01:02:36		 When you say you went through the training quite quickly, I mean how tough was it for you, were you a fit young man? 
5	0 days 01:02:42		 Oh yes yes I mean you had to be I mean twenty mile route march right across… from the barracks down to Devonport across the Torpoint ferry and then a twenty mile route march along the coast to the firing range did our initial firing with live ammunition and then round back to barracks that was our main and training to toughen us up. 
6	0 days 01:03:20		 Was it in summer or winter? 
7	0 days 01:03:24		 When was it I joined… well it will be March it would be February March by the time we got to Plymouth so it wasn’t too bad. 
8	0 days 01:03:39		 Were you a good swimmer were you swimming in Hampstead pools and stuff? 
9	0 days 01:03:42		 No I’d… even getting in the bath was too deep in those days but then during training there was Royal Marine swimming pool in Deal close to Deal Castle and there you were taught and made to swim because as a Royal Marine aboard a ship you never knew whether you had to swim or not as it so happens I mean I did have to swim in shark infested waters but that’s another story

11	0 days 01:04:20		 When you was down in Deal obviously that you know… were you seeing a lot of The Battle of Britain? 
12	0 days 01:04:25		 No we didn’t see a thing… I mean that was a I don’t even know when the Battle of Britain was but I mean we didn’t see much of that at all. The only thing I do remember was that there was a German sea plane with red cross markings and I know that there was a submarine in the Channel and it fired at a ship just of Deal with two torpedoes and the torpedoes missed the ship hit the beach and jumped up onto the beach and we were taken down there on guard in case anybody got near them but other than that saw very little action there until we got to Plymouth. 
13	0 days 01:05:29		 Ok so you got to Plymouth do you know you’re going to be on The Prince of Wales at this point and what was it like when you suddenly saw that ship for the first time and you knew that was what was going to be? 
14	0 days 01:05:38		 No not until you’d finished training and they were detailing off a hundred and eighty Royal Marines to be the detachment of the Battleship Prince of Wales and it was then that about twenty five of our squad were all detailed off to be part of the hundred and eighty detachment Royal Marines for the Prince of Wales. That was ok we all organised a train from Devonport with all our kit on was straight through too Liverpool and a… was it Liverpool… yes Liverpool cause it was Liverpool because the Prince of Wales was built in Cammell Laird in Birkenhead and when we got to the docks the dock place in Birkenhead it was stowing then I’m sorry if I said earlier it was summer it wasn’t it was snowing… it was snowing like a so and so and we marched from Birkenhead railway station to Cammell Lairds dockyard and we formed up on the quay and we could see this ship laying over slightly onto the quayside and through the snow it only looked like a cruiser or a destroyer and to our amazement the Sgt Major came down and detailed us off and we marched aboard to our respective mess decks 
15	0 days 01:07:35		 And the reason the Prince of Wales was laying over at a slight angle was that the Germans had been bombing and they dropped a bomb between the Prince of Wales and the dockside which was ten feet the bomb missed the Prince of Wales went down into the water and exploded and blew loose one of the plates near the boiler room in the Prince of Wales which flooded her and she was laying over at an angle that was the first thing of the who do that the Prince of Wales was. 
16	0 days 01:08:17		 I was going to say when you saw that and you found that out I mean you know must have been exciting going onto the ship for the first time, but did you have a sense that there was a who do? 
17	0 days 01:08:26		 No… no… no it was just one of those things well its war and it happened we were darn lucky that it didn’t hit the ship itself and a the bomb hit the ship itself and make a big mess, it made enough mess as it was 
18	0 days 01:08:49		 Had you been on a ship at this point before? 
19	0 days 01:08:52		 No… 
20	0 days 01:08:53		 No so tell me what was it like leaving Liverpool well Birkenhead then? 
21	0 days 01:08:56		 I was detailed off to be at this time I wasn’t qualified at anything except as a plain Royal Marine but I was detailed off in the Navy or any ships passing another ship merchant ship and that you lower the white ensign and the ship lowers there ensign in recognition if the ship didn’t lower its ensign then you went for her and I was in the aft lowering the ensign cold and freezing job but it was one of those things until we got to Scapa. We got to Scapa and we would sent into the dock in Scapa and repaired and then of course it was training. Part of the training Churchill wanted to go to America and meet Roosevelt and The Prince of Wales was destined for it and we took Churchill across to America to meet Roosevelt 
22	0 days 01:10:27		 What was the you know… when you’re on a ship obviously now there’s a completely new set of training can you talk a bit about some of the you know intensive training that you’d of been going through as she was you know almost shake down trials? 
23	0 days 01:10:41		 It so happens that being a brand new ship they was short of Gunnery and Artificers and Machinists and things like that and they went through the crew records and of course my record showed that I’d been in the machine shops and in the industry prior to joining the Royal Marines and so I was detailed to go down to the machine shop, we had a beautiful machine shop down on The Prince of Wales and met the Chief Petty Officer and I can still see it now he questioned me then he gave me a piece of machine and said here you are boy make that and I’d hardly got the metal into the lathe he said you know what you’re doing your duty is here. So when the Royal Marines were on parade I was excused duties because I was in the machine shop the Chief Petty Officer of the machine shop said that we were at war the ship had to be brought up to full fighting standard and therefore I was to remain in the machine shop while the rest of the Royal Marines were on parade. 
24	0 days 01:12:19		 Was that a good thing or a bad thing for you? 
25	0 days 01:12:20		 Oh no it was a good thing because I mean it meant to say that half past three of an afternoon four o’clock was evening quarters. Half past three you had to go up and redress polish your uniform, polish everything to be on parade at four o’clock for the Captain Marines inspection and as I was as I say down in the… there were four of us there was three working in the gun turret and I was in the machine shop and we was excused those duties so we used to carry on there. 
26	0 days 01:12:59		 What was it like being below deck when you were first night sailing were you seasick? 
27	0 days 01:13:03		 I was seasick for the first day and then after that my body seemed to of acclimatised and so I wasn’t seasick after that I mean going across the Atlantic to America I mean we had a pretty rough time but I seemed to settle down and I was alright I mean there were other poor devils being terribly seasick and I was walking around quite good. 
28	0 days 01:13:36		 Ok… so after the sea trials you went up to Skapa is that right? 
29	0 days 01:13:39		 Yes… 
30	0 days 01:13:40		 What were you doing up there and what was the experience of being up there like? 
31	0 days 01:13:46		 Commonly known in the Royal Navy as ‘swinging round the Buoy’ we were just anchored in Skapa just doing normal training you know aboard ship while we were anchored until such time we were ordered to accompany The Hood the Bismarck was out and we were ordered with The Hood the Battleship Hood to chase her and fight her and that was when The Hood got a shell in the magazine from the Bismarck and blew up and sunk and we got a fourteen inch shell from the Bismarck which landed I can’t remember how it was very close to our rear magazine if that had exploded it happened to be a dud but if it had of exploded the Prince of Wales would have blown up as well but that was the number two of the who do of the Prince of Wales. 
32		New Film	New Film ** Start of Film 3 
33	0 days 01:14:55		 What was the sort of sense on board when you knew you were now engaged probably for the first time in a proper battle with serious you know… with potential a serious outcome? 
34	0 days 01:15:10		 I can’t really tell you… my gunnery position when I was not on duty In the machine shop and that was on the port side number one Dual Purpose 5.25 Gun and my position was in the transfer section where the shells came and the ammunition came up from the magazines and into the space where I was which was then transferred to the guns 
35	0 days 01:15:49		 And what was I mean it must have been an immense spectacle is it terrifying I mean can you try and record some of what you were seeing? 
36	0 days 01:16:00		 I… it was in a more or less sealed compartment on the first… one deck below the upper deck you didn’t see anything all you knew was the fact that when the guns fired you had to get another… operate a lever and get another section of ammunition up from the magazines so you didn’t know what was going on all you knew was the explosion, the noise of the guns firing. 
37	0 days 01:16:39		 Was The Hood on the port side of you as well? 
38	0 days 01:16:41		 No she was ahead of us, she was about what a quarter of a mile I think I can only guestimate that she was about a quarter of a mile in front of the Prince of Wales and the only thing that happened when she blew up there was a piece of The Hood that landed somehow or another in the space of that a piece of The Hood when she blew up landed on the foc’sle the front of the Prince of Wales one of these amazing things you know the two ships a quarter of a mile apart one blows up and a piece of the ship that blew up landed on the Prince of Wales 
39	0 days 01:17:33		 When you were hit do you recall feeling that… that impact? 
40	0 days 01:17:38		 No you’re talking about a thirty five thousand ton battleship and an explosion of a shell hitting you… you didn’t even hear, feel it. 
41	0 days 01:17:55		 What happens after an engagement like that I mean this is the first time isn’t it. What can you do as a young man who’s just been involved in something like that with the noise how do you wind down or do you not? 
42	0 days 01:18:07		 No you don’t just one of those things no more than as I’m sitting here now I mean you’re trained to obey orders and you just carry on 
43	0 days 01:18:22		 Ok so after you’ve engaged the Bismarck you head back to the UK is that right? 
44	0 days 01:18:27		 Yes… 
45	0 days 01:18:28		 What do you recall of that and what was it like you know being back because you’ve obviously been out and you come back did you get leave? 
46	0 days 01:18:35		 Well we went straight into knowing we got water trouble well at the time there was the flooding in the after magazine we went straight into Rosyth and straight into the dockyard the dry dock at Rosyth of course when they pumped the water out of the Prince of Wales and they got down to find out why the flooding was in the after magazine they found this dirty great big fourteen inch shell laying there not far from the after magazine and there was a right panic everybody clear the ship and the ship was cleared and then they got down and cut the side plate of the ship out and lifted the shell out and repaired that and then we were allowed back aboard ship again great fun 
47		New Film	New Film ** Start of Film 4 
48	0 days 01:19:45		 The next big thing you did was you took Churchill to America? 
49	0 days 01:19:48		 Yes… 
50	0 days 01:19:49		 What was… what did you know about I mean I take it you weren’t told well we got Churchill coming on next Wednesday what was it like… how did you find out what you were doing? 
51	0 days 01:20:01		 There was virtually no information passed the fact that Mr Churchill the Prime Minister was being… is coming aboard were taking him to America and that was it and he used to wander down the mess decks and he come along and you find your sitting there next to him talking to him and then he’ll beetle of and he’ll go around somewhere else he wandered all-round the ship but he was quite a great character the thing was the thing I do remember about that was that the…we were to meet the Americans in Arcangle Bay in Canada and the yanks had placed a dirty great big red buoy where they wanted the Prince of Wales to anchor and to great satisfaction of the Royal Navy as we come up alongside this dirty great big red buoy the officer of the watch ordered the anchor to be released and he dropped it straight on top of this dirty great big red buoy sort of two fingers up to the Americans you want us there were there! On top of it 
52	0 days 01:21:29		 and that was the main thing I remember about that of course I can’t remember what day it was but I know that on the Sunday there was a church service aboard the Prince of Wales when Roosevelt came aboard the Prince of Wales and Churchill and we had the church service and I got somewhere among my records a photograph taken and I was right at the very back against the rail at the service well I got a photograph somewhere taken that day 
53	0 days 01:22:12		 Can you remember any of the conversations you had with Churchill? 
54	0 days 01:22:14		 No… cor it’s now forty fifty sixty… sixty seventy its over seventy years 
55	0 days 01:22:23		 My apologise… one thing I was curious about is you know you’ve obviously had a major engagement it’s 41, your off to America looks like there coming in can you remember much about what the sense of war was like, what it was like now at this point against… you knew it was a major war? 
56	0 days 01:22:44		 No I mean we were engaged, I was engaged in the gunnery side and the machine shop you thought about that you didn’t… you didn’t think about… you were serving the country and you just carried on I mean you had no political thoughts what so ever as far as I can remember 
57	0 days 01:23:09		 So on this journey to America with Churchill and the return did you encounter any you know U-Boat action, mountainous seas? 
58	0 days 01:23:20		 The one thing I do remember was that on the way back we came across a British Convoy coming from America to England and the Prince of Wales steamed right through the middle of the convoy showing the flag and there was Churchill on the stern of the Prince of Wales waving like mad at the ships as we went passed that’s the only thing that I can remember about that 
59	0 days 01:23:55		 What about you touched upon earlier about some of the storms that you encountered do you remember anything any particular rough seas now? 
60	0 days 01:24:03		 No forty five thousand ton battleship I mean alright she did toss around a bit but you it was just one of those things you never thought about. 
61	0 days 01:24:14		 Operation Halberd 
62	0 days 01:24:16		 Never heard of it! 
63	0 days 01:24:18		 September 41 says participated in Operation Halberd along with the battleship Nelson and Rodney as well as the aircraft carrier the Arc Royal? 
64	0 days 01:24:26		 Oh that’s the Mediterranean I never knew what it was called yes that was another one we did there were fourteen transports and the orders were that Malta was on its knees and we had to escort and there was the Nelson, the Rodney, the Arc Royal as you say the Prince of Wales oh dear I got it… I think I got it on my ramblings upstairs there was three or four cruisers and I don’t know how many destroyers and our orders were Malta at all costs and the Germans attacked us and the only ship that got a torpedo was the Nelson and she got a torpedo right in the bow of the ship the front of the ship and she was going down at about… going along about five degrees in the water the bows were, the bows she was sort of sailing slightly down in the water 
65	0 days 01:25:50		 And the other thing I remember about that was the fact that a German plane… now who was he attacking, I can’t remember who he was attacking but I know one of the Arc Royal aircraft got his tail and shot him down and I’m not sure now or I can’t remember exactly but I believe it was the Prince of Wales was firing anti-aircraft and shot the British fighter down as well, we shot the British fighter down he shot the German down then we shot him down and I remember we got back after we delivered the convoy we went back into Gibraltar for a day’s leave and we happened to meet this pilot, he was rescued the British pilot the fighter and the language he called the Prince of Wales and us was unrepeatable 
66	0 days 01:27:07		 When you say you went to Malta I take it you… did you get on shore in Malta? 
67	0 days 01:27:11		 No no it was a question of delivering these transports to Malta because they was starving and as soon as the all clear was done we turned round and went straight back as I say we called in at Gibraltar for the day. I always remember the shops in Malta because I mean in war time rationing and things like that and I found in a sweet shop a seven pound box of Cadbury’s milk tray chocolates funny how you can remember these things and I bought this box of chocolates sealed with a brown paper seal around the outside I slipped it off took one of the chocolate’s out for myself slipped it back wrapped it up took it to the padre on the Prince of Wales or was the censor got it censored and I sent it home to my mother. That’s the only thing I can remember about Malta. 
68		New Film	New Film ** Start of Film 5 
69	0 days 01:28:23		 Alright so after you’d been into the Mediterranean was it good to get… was it good to go from you know to start seeing parts of the world do you have a recollection of the fact you’ve gone from America, Canada back to Med? 
70	0 days 01:28:37		 You never thought about it… it was just a duty and you just carried on its only now you asking these questions that I can think back about it. I’ve had no… the other time you were on duty you had a job to do and that’s it you carried on you never thought about seeing Gibraltar or America or anything like that just it was part of duty and you just carried on 
71	0 days 01:29:07		 While you’re on the ship and you’d been on it for sort of nine…you know eight… seven or eight months now what’s the camaraderie like now did you form… did you start to form good friendships? 
72	0 days 01:29:17		 Yes I mean as a Royal Marine detachment of a hundred and eighty although you formed a closer relationship with the ten other Royal Marines or nine other Royal Marines that were on the mess deck. I mean the mess deck comprised of a hundred and eighty ten… ten twenty mess decks and there were nine other Royal Marines on your mess deck you got to know them more than anything else. There were other Royal Marines that were in the squad that would you’d train with that you knew and we were friends with but you mainly got to know the nine others on your mess deck. 
73	0 days 01:30:14		 What sort of stuff did you get up too with them can you remember you know cards, games, fun, jokes? 
74	0 days 01:30:21		 Now what was it I was making… …I can’t remember now but we all had a hobby and I know I had a… I can’t remember now what it was I was making something on the mess deck in the evening when you were free and you all had a hobby you were either writing or doing something like that of an evening 
75	0 days 01:30:51		 How much you know how big was the room, how big was the space? 
76	0 days 01:30:55		 Mess deck well now… I should say it was about ten times the size of this room each mess deck because at night in the ceiling were big steel pipes or hangers and you used to hand your hammock on those on these hooks and you slept in the hammock above the mess deck 
77	0 days 01:31:33		 What was it like was it easy to adapt to night sleeping in a hammock? 
78	0 days 01:31:39		 Ooh yes in those days you were young and innocent still innocent but you just got on with it I mean a hammock is quite comfortable for sleeping in and the old soldiers as we used to call them the old Royal Marines they used to help us youngsters at anything that wanted doing get us into the life of living aboard 
79	0 days 01:32:10		 Sounds… food do you remember much of the food, I’m just trying to get sense a of what life was like when you weren’t because obviously ninety nine percent boredom and one percent terror so I was just wondering about that you know when you’re not working what you’re doing? 
80	0 days 01:32:24		 Well as I say you all had a hobby of some sort an another and then each day one person on the mess deck was responsible for the food and you used to have to go down to the galley the main ships galley where all the food was cooked and tell them the mess number and they used to dish out the rations for the food then you used to go back to the mess deck and put the plates out and either help yourself or you served it out so everybody got equal rations cause you very likely know where if you put a plate down on a table with six people there’s one of the six is going to be greedy and grab as much as they can so as Royal Marines I mean you dished it out equally and everybody got the same you knew that the next day one of your mates on the mess deck will be doing cook of the mess and so if he didn’t get treated right you didn’t get treated right. So you mucked in messed in with the comradeship that developed 
81	0 days 01:33:48		 Had you lost any… when you got on board and you were in your mess had you lost any of your comrades during any of the conflicts that you had the battles? 
82	0 days 01:33:54		 No no we didn’t lose anybody… 
83	0 days 01:33:57		 In October you set sail for the Far East? 
84	0 days 01:34:01		 Oh yeah well it was called G-Force that was it yes we set sail to the Far East called in at Cape Town. Cape Town was neutral they were told at seven o’clock in the morning it’s funny how I can remember some of these things seven o’clock in the morning on the radio Cape Town was told that the Battleship the Prince of Wales was coming in the Repulse that was with us she went up to Durban we called in at Cape Town seven o’clock in the morning the people in Cape Town were told that the battleship the Prince of Wales was coming in and I seemed to recall about eleven o’clock twelve o’clock we… eleven o’clock we pulled into Cape Town twelve o’clock three or four hundred people waiting at the gates so that those that were on leave that day that were free to have a day’s leave you were allowed to go out into the town and we were picked up. I was picked up with two petty officers that of the Royal Navy by a family by the name of Glove the father of this family was responsible for the electrification of the London underground in whenever it was and they entertained us for the day and took us out and round 
85	0 days 01:35:45		 That’s wonderful isn’t it? 
86	0 days 01:35:48		 Yeah… 
87	0 days 01:35:49		 Did you go up table mountain? 
88	0 days 01:35:50		 No I don’t think we… I can’t remember anything about it all I can remember I say it’s funny I can remember they lived in Kei Apple Road it’s funny how some of these things coming back they lived in Kei Apple Road in Cape Town because after I got home after being prisoner of war I wrote to them and I got a smashing letter back from them 
89	0 days 01:36:19		 That’s nice and then Cape Town you went on to Sri Lanka is that right? 
90	0 days 01:36:23		 Yes… we went onto Colombo can’t remember much about that but a… now where did Repulse go we went into Colombo and I can’t remember where the Repulse went to then we joined up together and steamed down to Singapore 
91	0 days 01:36:45		 What was it like… do you remember now that you know obviously you were into the southern hemisphere you’ve gone through the equator did you do anything when you crossed the equator? 
92	0 days 01:36:55		 Oh yes in fact I think there’s a photograph I’ve got there’s a book if you want any more information if you can ever get hold of it there’s a little thin book called ‘One Year of Life’ and it was written by one of the lieutenants his father was the gunnery commander and he was a lieutenant and it’s called ‘One Year of Life’ it’s got photographs and that in it but oh yes we had the crossing the line ceremony I was fortunate I didn’t get dumped I mean there’s only a certain length of time that you can carry out a thing like that during the day and they dumped about twenty chaps King Neptune lard and plastered the individual and then dumped in a great big tank and that it was quite fun that 
93		New Film	New Film ** Start of Film 6 
94	0 days 01:38:00		 So you’ve headed onto Singapore what can you remember of that and was there any anticipation about what you were there facing? 
95	0 days 01:38:09		 No I remember we steamed past… steamed past Singapore town and up into the dockyard I’ve actually been back and I’ve actually got photographs. I’ve got a photograph somewhere of the Prince of Wales tied up in the Navy dockyard in Singapore and when I organised one of the first groups of prisoners of war back as a tour guide we got back and went into the dockyard and I’ve got a photograph of exactly the same position that the Prince of Wales was in 
96	0 days 01:38:56		 So you head from Singapore down to Malaya is that right? 
97	0 days 01:38:59		 Well we were the Prince of Wales… there was a report came in from the Army that there was a Japanese invasion up around the area of Kota Bharu which is North… the north of Malaya and as the report was there was a Japanese invasion fleet there they dispatched the Prince of Wales and the Repulse to get in amongst them and sort them out but it was a complete trap because the Japanese had accumulated god knows how many twin engine bombers in Saigon and of course as we got up in towards Kuanton and that of Malaya we were well within their range and of course as soon as we got in their range the Japanese went for us and they were coming at us about ten twelve aircraft at a time five at one side and five at the other side so it didn’t matter which way you turned you steered the ship you were running into their torpedoes 
98	0 days 01:40:17		 And the first torpedo of the Japanese hit the Prince of Wales on the port after it was the… we had four propellers two on each side and the torpedo hit the ship just forehead of the inner propeller they bent the shaft twelve inch diameter shaft the explosion bent the shaft and it ripped the back end of the Prince of Wales open and of course we went down… we went down to an angle of about fifteen degrees straight away with the amount of water that flooded in there I think some of the boffins of that reckon there was about ten thousand gallons of water flooded the Prince of Wales in about thirty seconds well of course in view of the fact that we were that badly damaged and that and we were starting to sink they gave the order to abandon ship and the sergeant in charge of our gun ordered us on to the focsle of the ship counted us out and found he got the whole of the Royal Marine crew and then ordered us to jump or to abandon ship rather 
99	0 days 01:41:47		 And I can recall there was a rope there and I went down the rope so far caught my foot in one of the portholes in the side of the ship and just sort of gave myself a push and let go and dropped and it’s been calculated it was seventy feet from the time I let go of the rope to the water I tell people today I won’t even jump in the bath it’s too deep but then we swam the Navy have two or three different types of rescue and one of them is a what they call a Carley Float which is a great big what ten feet in those days it was ten feet square mat with floats placed every about a foot away from it from each other as a rescue float and I know I got onto, held onto the side of that we with a load of other chaps we pushed it and that towards the destroyer and climbed up aboard the destroyer and… which was one of our three escort destroyers and after that we were taken back to Singapore 
100	0 days 01:43:13		 What was it like to be you know that… did you I mean you talked before about being hit by a shell you didn’t feel it did you instantly know, were you in your gunnery position and did you instantly know that this was a major hit? 
101	0 days 01:43:25		 Well yes because of the angle she developed although I was in the as I say in the transfer room below deck immediately the shape and that of the room where we was we knew it was over and the sergeant in charge of the gunnery as I say ordered us aboard to evacuate and abandon ship 
102	0 days 01:44:00		 What was it like when you were in the water I mean could you see all these Japs buzzing around? 
103	0 days 01:44:04		 Ooh no the Japs… the Japs knew they got us they in fact one flight did come over and they signalled to the destroyer I can remember this piece the Japanese signalled to the destroyer to cease fire and pick up survivors and this was told over the tannoy of the destroyer that and of course our own destroyer was picking up survivors and we were taken back to Singapore 
104	0 days 01:44:51		 Which destroyer was it? 
105	0 days 01:44:52		 I ‘m not sure whether it was the Destroyer Express or the Destroyer Electra… there was the Express, the Electra and the Tenedos the three destroyers the Tenedos was an Australian destroyer I’m not sure at this present moment in time which one it was it could have been Express 
106	0 days 01:45:18		 Did you actually see the Prince of Wales go under? 
107	0 days 01:45:23		 Oh yes yes… 
108	0 days 01:45:25		 What was that like I mean you spent a good year on her? 
109	0 days 01:45:26		 The only thing I can remember is the fact that I was well away from her because you knew that when a ship sinks I mean the undertow will take you down as well and a number of us were who were hanging on to the side of this cork float we were pushing it away and one of the chaps said you know yelled she’s going and she turned completely over I can remember this funny enough talking to you I can remember these sort of things she turned completely over and you could hear the guns the big fourteen inch guns there were three sets of them the weight of those turrets they were just dropping out of the ship because they weren’t anchored down I mean the weight of the Naval gun I mean is such that it rolls around on bearings and that and once she’s upside down I mean they just fall out 
110	0 days 01:46:40		 And when you got on to whichever the destroyers it was did you…you know is this when you became aware that you’d lost some of your mess or were you all…? 
111	0 days 01:46:50		 No you were just thankful that you were aboard the you know a rescue ship it wasn’t until we got back to Singapore and even then we didn’t know until the Royal Marines now I can’t remember exactly what happened now but once you got back to Singapore the Prince of Wales Royal Marines were detailed of as guards for the Singapore naval wireless station and the Repulse Royal Marines were detailed to guard they Navy stores in the Royal Navy dockyard so it was only then and even then I don’t think we really had a roll call for exactly who was missing it isn’t until I been doing this research now that I know who was lost because of the dates given of death

113	0 days 01:48:04		 Ok so finally on land anyway as a Royal Marine in Singapore what do you remember now at this point? 
114	0 days 01:48:16		 Getting a little bit rough the Army were fighting a retreat down Malaysia and the retreat was such that they got of the causeway big causeway that joins Malaysia to Singapore and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were the last British troops across the causeway before it was blown… blown they dynamited it within twenty four hours the Japs were crossing the gap which was blown it was more or less like a little swimming pool but it was decided that the Royal Marines would join the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders who had been cut up very badly in Malaya and we were ordered to join the Argyll’s and we fought in the final stages of Singapore island with the Argyll’s and we became known which is one of the honours in the Royal Marines today are the Plymouth Argyll’s all the Royal Marines came from Plymouth Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders so they couldn’t rename them anything else and there was about equal number the Royal Marines and the Argyll’s so we were called the Plymouth Argyll’s and it’s down in history the battalion of the Plymouth Argyll’s fighting in Singapore. 
115	0 days 01:50:12		 And I mean you fire huge guns on a ship and you probably trained with some machine guns but what was it like when you started actually fighting? 
116	0 days 01:50:20		 All I can remember about that it was pouring down with bloody rain we were moved up with the Argyll’s up into the more or less jungle rubber plantation sorry not jungle rubber plantation in the north east corner of Singapore island and I can remember sort of roughly recall staying under a palm tree pouring down with bloody rain and the next thing we knew was being shot at by the Japs and retreating back and getting back finally into the Argyll’s barracks in Singapore and told we had to surrender that was about it 
117	0 days 01:51:16		 What was that like can you remember? 
118	0 days 01:51:18		 I can’t really… I can’t really remember just the fact that oh well that’s it were prisoners of war 
119	0 days 01:51:31		 And what was it like when you came face to face with the Japanese then and they started moving you about? 
120	0 days 01:51:35		 We didn’t funny enough the Japs ordered all prisoners of war oh before that… …when we got back to Tysal Park which was the Argyll’s headquarters in the fighting I got a mortar bomb splinter in my left hand the scars still there and I was sent down to Singapore general hospital because in the tropics if you ever go in the tropics and you cut yourself that will turn poison within hours and of course with that on my knuckle it blew up and I was sent down to Singapore general hospital and that was more or less were I was well taken prisoner… the Japanese I didn’t see many Japanese any Japanese at all they come in and ordered everybody out of Singapore general hospital because they wanted it for their own troops and I was moved with a number of other allied servicemen who were also there to a small school which was a first aid post and from there up into Changi Village, which was were the Japanese they cordoned off the northnortheast corner I think it is of Singapore island it’s now occupied by the Singapore airport and we were moved up there and I joined the Argyll’s and the Marines that were there and that part of it. 
121	0 days 01:53:45		 Regimental doctor of course wanted some help and my pal who was a corporal on the Repulse and myself and a Argyll volunteered to act as orderlies for the doctor and so we had a special little place in one of the shops in Singapore in Changi village which was the medical room and we had… we lived in the Navy quarters in the back the three of us so we were separated a little bit but we did alright 
122	0 days 01:54:22		 When did you move out of Singapore when were you herded out? 
123	0 days 01:54:26		 I can’t give you exact date but the 1936 fact is something I’m doing upstairs at the moment there was a scheme to connect the Thai railway to the Burmese railway and the Japanese had got the plans for this in fact I found two of the plans that are in existence in the Royal Geographical Society in London I’d been up there and traced them and in 1936 there were two British, one American and one other attempt or idea to join the railway of Thailand to Burma and the Japs got hold of these and this is why you got the River Kwai railway today because they used one of the plans. But they were shipping us prisoners up to build the Thailand Railway and six hundred of us crowded into cattle trucks for about three day journey from Singapore up to Ban Pong in Thailand which was the village where really the whole thing started 
124	0 days 01:56:04		 Can you remember much about what that journey was like and what were your feelings at this point? 
125	0 days 01:56:08		 Well you had no feelings you just accepted what was carrying on. The journey itself was pretty horrendous because with twenty thirty I can’t remember now exactly men crowded into an ordinary goods truck not the big long ones short ones and you used to take turns to sit by the door you organised it and sit by the door and on the way I can’t remember how many stops there were and the Japanese gave you rice and vegetable soup. The rice was what you see as rice is polished rice but you get a lot of broken rice pieces of rice which are broken during the process and course that is virtually fed to cattle in Malaysia and Thailand and that and of course that being virtually free Japanese fed that to us fortunately unpolished rice has a certain amount of vitamin in it and it did help us quite a bit but we were pretty well starving by the time we got… towards Ban Pong.

127	0 days 01:57:43		 You got to Ban Pong and you know do you remember what your impressions were what was happening at this point? 
128	0 days 01:57:51		 Yes yes I got very very close association let me say I am Church of England this is about a Catholic mission now in Ban Pong there’s a church and today at school where they educate two and a half thousand boys and two and a half thousand girls and when we walked from the trucks we were ordered to get out in Ban Pong we had to pass this catholic mission just a small church and that and alongside the road there were baskets of fruit and baskets of eats and allsorts and there was a catholic priest in white because we was walking past he was there telling us please you take you take and we walked about half a mile to a compound where we were made to stay as the first part of the prisoner of war. 
129	0 days 01:59:09		 Now when I first went back having memories of this food and this priest I went back and I found this mission I found actually the priest and he left Italy as a boy of seventeen as a missionary priest and he lived there all his life he came to England, he was going to Italy and he came to England he stayed in this house with me and he was one of the most marvellous people you could ever have he saved a lot a lot of lives with the work that he did with the prisoners of war 
130	0 days 02:00:02		 After we got to this what is it a school it’s a Buddhist school we were put into this compound and then after so many days which it was in the flood season of the area and I know that the compound was part flooded with water so we were living in water part of the time then the Japanese they crowded us into Japanese lorries we were one of the fortunate… I was one of the fortunate lot we were taken from Ban Pong to Kanchanaburi were the Bridge on the river Kwai is by Japanese lorries albeit we were crowded like sardines in a tin but still we didn’t have to walk all the other poor devils had to walk the fifty miles that it is 
131	0 days 02:01:07		 And when did you know what you were sort of doing and what was the sort of day to day work and you know and distance like? 
132	0 days 02:01:14		 You just obeyed the Japanese because the Japanese well it was mainly Koreans on that part during the Japanese Chinese war the Japanese had battalions of Koreans in China and when the Chinese attacked the Koreans ran so the Japanese never put the Koreans into the front line again but they put them in charge of us prisoners of war so the Japanese were beating the Koreans and the Koreans were beating us and some of those Koreans after the war they met the hangman from the treatment they gave us 
133	0 days 02:02:10		 But when we got to Kanchanaburi again I was one of the fortunate lot we were put on the barges as you say you been to Thailand and you seen the river barges that run on the river and we were crowded into those sitting on the top of rice which we finally found out was to be our ration because every night we used, they used to stop and unload so many sacks of rice at that camp and so many at the next camp and I think it was about four days we were on the river Kwai if you’ve been there you’ve been to the river Kwai village hotel yes… oh well the river Kwai village hotel is a beautiful little hotel if you ever go back that is on the river bank and the camp I was in was at the top of the hill where there is a what do you call it when the water bubbles out of the a… 
134	0 days 02:03:23		 A spring… there’s a spring at the top of the hill and that was where our camp was and I drank out of that water and today that water is being ducted down the hillside and if you go to the river Kwai village hotel it forms part of a waterfall at the back of the hotel and some of the water is diverted for cooking its good water but that was where we started and we had to start digging and blasting and cutting the rocks for the railway 
135	0 days 02:04:04		 Could you remember what you know you talked about some of the Koreans met the hangman can you remember some of the mistreatment you got? 
136	0 days 02:04:09		 Some of the? 
137	0 days 02:04:11		 Maltreatment that was dished out to you? 
138	0 days 02:04:15		 Oh god yeah the Koreans one particular incident I got up during the night funny how you can remember some of these things I mean the huts we were living in were bamboo palm leaf roofs and where we slept… slept was split bamboo platforms about eighteen inches of the ground we had no bedding or anything like that you just slept on the bear bamboo and I got up this night to go to the toilet and this bloody Japanese what was it… what was he… he was the Mad Mongol… Mad Mongol he was a right so and so big bloke and whenever you passed any of these guards you all had to stop and bow to them and of course I was diving for the toilet and as I came out he caught up with me and bashed me two or three times I never forgot that so and so I know he was one of those that went for the chop after the war, but the Koreans because they were being beaten by the Japanese they took it out on us and there were quite a number of Koreans that got exterminated after the war for war crimes 
139	0 days 02:05:57		 Did you ever try and escape? 
140	0 days 02:05:59		 There was no need there was no possible chance we were in the jungle now there is no food in the jungle there’s only wild animals and snakes I mean pythons up to twenty thirty feet long, monkeys there was the rations you were given, there was no way you could survive you didn’t know where you were we knew we were by the river, the river Kwai that was about as far as we knew. Where were we, we didn’t know how far Burma was, we didn’t know how far, where the Japanese were or anything else. There was no way there were two or three that tried to escape they were caught finally by the Japanese and executed because they tried to escape the Japanese but there was just nothing you could do 
141	0 days 02:07:07		 How did you keep up your morale? 
142	0 days 02:07:08		 I can’t tell you… you just carried on you sort of lived in a twilight world that was it if you could scrounge anything if you could pinch anything you did it not from your mates from the Koreans the Japanese I mean they were the target. In the last camp now this was after the railway was finished and I was for the last year I was down in a railway repair workshop the Jap were they Jap or Korean I think they were Japs at this time guards the first thing we had to do was to build a… to dig a trench and it was nine feet wide seven feet deep with a slope on the inside and all the soil was piled on the outside so therefore the outside was what ten feet high which was to stop us from escaping 
143		New Film	New Film ** Start of Film 9 
144	0 days 02:08:23		 Well of course living in this camp with the guards patrolling around the top all the time there were two incidents there first of all I managed to get into the carpenters shop now the Japs in charge of the railway repair workshop which we were… there was six hundred of us two hundred British two hundred Australian two hundred Dutch and mainly Indonesian Dutch and I managed to get into the carpenters shop the wood shop and the wood shop was controlled by civilian Japanese in fact all the workshops this was repair workshop they moved it because it was being bombed by the allies in the other place where it was and we had three civilian Japanese in the workshop there was Pop who was a wizened old Jap and he never understood an never could speak English all he knew was pop was complementary and he treated us well he used to buy bananas and things like that there was Moon Face who come from Osaka description of his face is nothing to be desired and there was Sunny Boy who when he walked his feet were at ninety degrees I mean he and that and they were civilian Japs and they used to treat us well when we were working in the saw mill so that was alright so it wasn’t so bad 
145	0 days 02:10:19		 Can you remember what you know how you knew that the war was coming to an end? 
146	0 days 02:10:24		 The Japanese lieutenant I think it was I can’t remember now had a radio now the radio had been fixed by Japanese technical people and it could only get Japanese but after a short time it started to go wrong and the call went out by the Japs if anybody knew radio we had an Australian who was I mean if you had a technical Australian he was a good one better not say anything more about the Australians but a call went out to see if anybody would, could repair this radio this chap went and volunteered to do it and he found that there was, it had been altered by the Japs and a piece was missing and he put a call out amongst the British and the Australians for certain bits and pieces bits of wire and things like that and he constructed the piece that was missing and went back fitted this piece in tuned it in… tuned it in to the allies radio which ever it was I think it was coming from India I’m not sure and cause turned it up and listened to it and then said to this Jap officer this ok… ooh no no… no good no good cause it was speaking in English 
147	0 days 02:12:31		 So cause with that he switched the radio down took this piece out that he’d made put it in his pocket or whatever he was wearing and fixed it back to Japanese in such a way about a week later or ten days later it broke down again it used to regularly break down once a week once a fortnight how he did it I just can’t tell you and of cause he was called back he used to do the same thing again get a bit more news and we knew that the war was coming to an end we knew the atomic bombs and of course the Japs knew this and of course they were a bit frightened and… 
148	0 days 02:13:25		 How did you know about the atomic bomb? 
149	0 days 02:13:26		 Through this chap with the radio you see I mean it broken down the British radio for the forces in India were broadcasting they dropped this atomic bomb and then that atomic bomb you know and so he was getting the information back having tuned the radio in British what’s name then used to take his little piece out tuned it back into Japanese and a week or a fortnight later it brake down again and he was called back again to do it again so we were kept… we knew… we knew the war was over now I can’t… I’ve got a bit of a blank there I can’t exactly remember now all I can remember and knew would never see it but to see a Lancaster bomber or a Liberator sorry they were Liberators in the Far East. 
150	0 days 02:14:40		 Liberator bomber flying along and seeing white puffs come out of the plane and knew that would appreciate of thinking it was engine backfiring engine trouble but then to see these white puffs slowly disintegrate and flutter and flutter down and knew that it was paper well I had a young boy in the workshop with me who lived close by a young Thai boy and I said… I can remember saying to Boon look that paper you bring to me and so we knew when the allies were dropping these papers they were destined for us they knew were the prison camps were and they were dropping these bundles of papers around prison camps hoping that we’d get them and so we knew when the war was over and of course the attitude of the Japs completely changed and I was moved back… moved back to the… the whole camp was moved back to a main base camp which was about four mile away and I fortunately the captain of the Marines of the Repulse was in that camp so course I being a Royal Marine I mean I got detailed to be with him and so we knew various things were going on and that 
151	0 days 02:16:27		 Can you remember what it was like when you saw that piece of paper when Boon brought it back? 
152	0 days 02:16:33		 Oh yes now what happened to that can’t remember now… I can’t remember now exactly what happened it very likely went for smoking because being close to a civilisation we could get so called Japanese… not Japanese… Thai tobacco some of the chaps just they’d rather smoke than eat whereas me… we were getting paid when we were in the workshop we were getting paid ten cents a day well a bunch of bananas would cost you two dollars from the outside you know Thai’s bringing in and so we used to keep a thing going like that 
153	0 days 02:17:30		 So you’ve been liberated what was it like returning to England after all that time and seeing your family? 
154	0 days 02:17:39		 Well we were flown… when we were told to we were taken down to Bangkok and again by the Japanese… the Japanese now under allied control and we were taken down to Bangkok and billeted in the hanger… hanger I think is still… I’m not sure last… when I first went out it was still there the hanger and the following morning we were detailed off twenty men right your number one group twenty men your number two group twenty men your number three group and at a certain time in the morning there were nothing in half an hour there were twenty… it’s funny talking to you I can remember these details and yet I can’t remember other details there were twenty Dakotas landed and you were told right your number so and so get on that plane 
155	0 days 02:18:55		 and we were flown back to Rangoon, Rangoon to I can’t remember what it was now it was turned into a British hospital in Rangoon and then after a time we were detailed off onto a transport ship and it was Worcester… the name of the ship was Worcester and there was about twenty of us Marines including the Captain of the Marines and one of our lieutenants who’d been gathered together we were taken down to Rangoon and put into this army place and we learnt there was a Royal Marine detachment who had come up the Rangoon river and were billeted in Rangoon and as soon as we knew this we got a… a number of Marines I can’t tell you how many there was now we commandeered a lorry went down to Rangoon and we were welcomed into the Royal Marine mess and we lived with the Royal Marines you know they never heard anything about us they were commandos coming in and we lived with them for about a week until we were detailed off to the Worcester to come home. 
156	0 days 02:20:33		 That must have been amazing to see you know fit young Royal Marines against yourself who was seven and a half stone? 
157	0 days 02:20:40		 Ooh yes I mean they absolutely adored us, they didn’t know who we were but no that was good that we had our own mess deck on the Worcester came back to Liverpool and we Royal Marines were taken down to Plymouth given ration cards and money and that and given two months leave go home and don’t report back for so and so 
158	0 days 02:21:12		 Can you remember what it was like going out to your home knocking on the door? 
159	0 days 02:21:16		 Yes I do actually my father when I… when the war came he’d been in the Royal Engineers in the 1418 war and had a bit of a rough time and he warned me when I went home and told him I joined the Royal Marines he said good luck boy when I came home after being a prisoner of war he’d got a big big sheet of something and tied it across the end of the road welcome home I can always remember that but then things happened and I left 
160	0 days 02:22:09		 And that’s your military life’s story yeah? 
161	0 days 02:22:12		 Yes well I went back after… I went back to the Royal Marines and due to my war service and that I was destined for… what was I… oh I was destined in those days of course all Royal Marines were trained as parachutists and I was told to report to the office one day you will be going to so and so for parachute training and I said no way… you will that is an order and I said I won’t and I had already learnt as I joined up in 1940 there was no war service Marines then and course after I’d joined they started recruiting war service Marines and I learnt I could transfer so I told the recruiting sergeant what I thought of him when into the office applied for transfer for war service went back to him threw my application on his desk and said here are now you know what you can do and I came out 
162	0 days 02:23:33		 I nearly went back but commando work was not my I was not fit enough and that to do commando work so having gone back to my old company… no I didn’t I thought as tall as I am once I got fairly fit I wanted to be a policeman so I joined the City of London police and that was a bloody site worse than the Marines ever was so after a year directing traffic and that at the Bank of England. In those days there were seven policeman at the Bank of England in London you very likely know the crossroads there… there’s traffic lights there now there used to be one in the middle and he would direct the other policeman around him to stopping and starting traffic on the different roads so after a year I thought it was a dam site worse than the Royal Marines so I packed it in and went back into industry 
163	0 days 02:24:41		 Do you have any you know overriding… what would be your overriding sort of reflection on your world war two experience? 
164	0 days 02:24:49		 Just one of those things I served my country to the best of my ability I survived as a prisoner of war, which was… let me to look at life somewhat differently and ok I just carry on I survived.
