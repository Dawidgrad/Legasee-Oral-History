just explain your relationship with the trumpeter well i met this chappy which is my my husband eventually am at one of the dancers in the drill hall and every time he came in i knew had a date that night to her and then that he went with a crowd of them so if he wasn't ashore am one of the others would come and take us girls out they had the only time that gwynn who's always clean shaven but you know that the navy is not allowed to just grow a moustache they must have a set so the number didn't you know that you oh yes you can't have just a moustache now the air force you know they could grow the big moustaches but you've got to get permission to grow a set and of course when they went on after convoys of course it would have been the thing to do is to grow a set because otherwise you know pretty cold shaving every day wins and that and he only grew a set once and then he when he was demobbed he shaved off the beard anne kept the moustache and then my mother said to him one day i don't like you with that so he shaved it he wouldn't shave it off for me but he shaved it off for a month he also was at the trumpeter was also on a a convoy to malta and i haven't got that photograph guess again my great nieces got it and as they were coming back from malta they called in gibraltar and there eating bananas cos suppose there were no bananas here to be had so they were showing off i think four of them in the picture all tucking into these bananas so they were not only on the russian convoys but they did the multi one anyway and they were also on the atlantic what would you feeling when he went off to sea to do for some i don't think that i ever thought anything could happen that i see i'm sure i didn't well i know i didn't you know we'll see you next time when you're back and never thought of it of being that dangerous although obviousy it was how close did you feel the war was sometimes a well as i think that one of the things that brought it home to me after d day was because i'd got a one of the americans i used to write to him it wasn't that he was a boy friend as such you know what i mean but a friend and he was of german extraction and another one was of italian extraction now it isn't this strange they're fighting against the the italians and the german it was funny but marvin he's the one that was killed in in belgium and i had one of my letters returned and it wasn't until that point because i hadn't known anybody else that had been killed and it wasn't until that point that i realized just how bad it was and then i had this he must have told his mother and that i was in girlfriend well i suppose i was a girl friend but i wouldn't say i was the girl friend if you know what i mean and she sent me i've got it there actually she sent me cater things as well so poor old marvin but i just reading this morning he was born in twenty nine i think it was twenty nine or born and twenty i didn't think he was that much younger but still there and then you tell you mention it in did did you did your work increase up to die oh there was no yes yes the resuwith a lot of action going on busy switchboards et cetera and a but at hatton now again we didn't do a lot firm parade work but we did go on divisions one day and you'd be nominated and very rarely were you on there but the captain in charge the chap in charge believe it or not didn't like res in the old lil stockings you know the thick lyle stockings you only like them in silk stockings so well stilt viren really i don't see the we been pure so well there weren't pure silk i do know that and so only ren that had silk stockings could go on parade because he didn't like lucette legs governed in it's the opposite way normally you know you have to go on the what's issued you know but not hub that with that was something
