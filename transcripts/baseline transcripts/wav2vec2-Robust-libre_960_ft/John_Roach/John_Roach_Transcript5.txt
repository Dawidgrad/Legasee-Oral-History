what do you remember of that some of the early arctic convoys that you did where we were normally sort of distant support the aircraft carriers and and battleships and battle cruisers and the the convoy went as a convoy it normally assembled probably in the north of scotland up in locke or somewhere like that and then they went up to iceland and we were based in iceland and when the convoy sailed we re sailed about the same time and then it all depended what what sort of danger they expected whether we were behind the convoy or to the right of it or to in front of it or whatever you know because now there were german destroyers and other ships and they were always worried about the bismark coming out which was based in norway and so our prime aim was he with any battleships and with aircraft carriers to to stop the biggest ships like a battleship interfering with the gun boys so we we weren't normally in the middle of the convoy but now and again we would pass the comer or be close to it you know you'd see the convoy or maybe thirty forty ships steaming along you may steam through the middle of it or something like that jin a it is very enlightening really that they cause a lot of them they were older ships and they were struggling to keep up the speed of course you know and a lot of them were a colburn and ships you know felt sorry for the poor stalkers down below they were shovelling coal all the time trying to make the ships do up nine or ten knots or something you know we only had to press a button and we could do thirty you know so it that was the main thing the combat were pretty slow so there was sitting ducks for for u boats really cause they stopped canvas a couple of years to rain the dead of winter you know it was the main thing was it was it was so cold and and and the and the seas were pretty rough you know there was a lot of bad weather you know you which you had to contend with and then the ships were icing over we could go up in the morning you see all the guns and all the guard rails and everything else would be covered in black ice where the water had come over on during the night time and froze and we had to go round and chip in hammers and chip and ship the ice off there were cases of smaller ships turning over up there when he became top heavy with ice and and the the ship rolled and never came back and just what i may if you touch was is very cold but just what do you remember of the cold when i remember going on on unwatched and putting because we didn't have any of these present day foul weather clothing that they've got these days you know we only had you know or our ordinary gear maybe we got issue with long johns and things like that and you put a couple of pairs of trousers on a couple of coats on and we only had duffle coats and and balaclavas and we got some some bags of goodies coming on board of somebody done a bit of knitting so looked like a crowd of pirates if you like when you but you put all the all the gear that you could on and a pair of gloves and maybe two pair at love to go and watch especially if you were look out or in an open position and i and all the bridges and that were where the officer the watch and the captain that the bridges in those days they were there were open so they're really open to the elements and then if you came off watch you'd be standing by again in case it was action stations you had to go back up so you just lay down on the deck and went to sleep and kept your gear or your clothes on you wouldn't have time to to put it all back on a vaccination sound so you normally slept in the gear you were in you might stay in the same gear for a week without taking it off and but then you know if if if the ship a ship was torpedoed or anything like that we the people didn't have any chance really if they ended up in the water because you you you only live about two minutes and in in the water you you'd be frozen uno frozen solid like to think man mentioned that you talked about people putting binoculars to their face ye just deprive described that ye well you had to breathe on them really before you put them in your face casino would make sure they kept them near your body trying to keep the lends a bit warm man you know or otherwise everything in the cold you you you you you could nearly you can nearly burn yourself with ice i suppose if you like you know but yes it was it was the cold weather you know the cold weather was a was the main thing very very cold and and rough rough seas and whom did you get into polian on the man could you ever to you now we we didn't we we we we we got on on the outskirts and then we turned round and picked up another convoy and came back again you know so there wasn't any anchorages in there for big ships really big ships did normally go in but the escorts went in because they would have to go in and pick up another convoy or whatever or go in and do a little bit of maintenance and things like that you know but the bigger ships they stood off so we didn't we didn't axle land in russia and then you touched on it but what about you boats did you see any u boats we had plenty of alarm the son's alarm alarm went we alter course and buzzed off in the other direction you know somebody picked up a u boat but you know as far as seen them we didn't see any you know we knew they were in the vicinity you know you you you you you'd hear a bang on a ship being torpedoed or something you know and and we were normally screened with the destroyers of frigates or whatever you know keeping us safe from you boats we hoped you know but in any you were alarmed and we we alter course quickly did you ever see any ships going down yes we did see a couple of them going down yes but in in the distance sort of you know but i die you could just see the mast moment and the next man and there was nothing there there's a big bang and then the thing in summary gone but but if they were you boats in the vicinity they'd say we we we would be shepherded away in another direction you know out of the way with the u boat so morley mot willy would be interested in sinking us if they got a chance of course with but we we we we week out of a we could be going a bit faster you know we got ahead the convoy and come back again and we could do or twenty or twenty knots or something like that and and zigzag as well so it would be pretty a difficult target for a u boat in those days when they only done about eight or nine knots on the water
