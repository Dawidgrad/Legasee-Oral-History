MY NAME IS IRENE BELLAMY I JUST UM WHERE ARE YOU FROM I WAS FROM BRISTOL FROM THE FISH PONDS AREA WHERE I WAS BORN AND I WENT TO SCHOOL IN BRISTOL AND STARTED MY WORK AFTER SCHOOL IN BRISTOL HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN WAR BROKE OUT UM WELL I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN NINETEEN SO I WAS TWENTY WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE FOR YOU IN BRISTOL I MEAN WHAT HAPPENED JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YOUR SCHOOLING AND JUST LIFE IN BRISTOL SO I UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE YEAH UM I ORIGINALLY WENT TO A SMALL PRIVATE SCHOOL AND THEN WENT TO COLSTON FROM THERE AND ERM BRISTOL ITSELF I FOUND RATHER DULL YOU KNOW IT WAS ALL PUBS AND CHURCHES THAT'S HOW IT SEEMED TO ME YOU KNOW THERE WEREN'T THE FUN THINGS THAT THERE ARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO DAY UM WE SPENT MOST OF OUR TIME EITHER GOING TO THE OUR FREE TIME GOING TO THE CINE M OR PLAYING SOME KIND OF GAMES YOU KNOW I BELONGED TO YOU KNOW VARIOUS HOCKEY TEAMS AND TENNIS CLUBS AND UM DURING DURING THE WAR UM OF COURSE WE WORKED VERY LONG HOURS AT ATE SO THAT YOU WEREN'T LOOKING FOR YOU MUCH LEISURE FUN AND I MOVED BECAUSE OF THE BRISTOL BLITZ DURING THAT TIME I WAS PUT BY THE FIRM THEY DIDN'T WANT US IN THE DANGER OF CENTRE OF BRISTOL AND SO ON AND SO THEY TOOK OVER A COTTAGE IN SHIPPING OLDBURY AND I LIVED IN SHIPPING SOBER FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THAT WAS QUITE GOOD FUN ACTUALLY WAS A SORT OF VILLAGE LIFE WHAT'S GOING ON BUT I'D ALWAYS HAD A YEN TO GO INTO THE NAVY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT MAINLY BECAUSE I HAD FRIENDS WHO HAD JOINED THE SERVICES UM WAS IT WAS IT WRENS OVER ANY OTHER SERVICE YEAH I DIDN'T WANT TO JOIN DO YOU MEAN ER IN RATS OR NO NO NO MY PARTICULAR FRIEND WENT INTO THE AND SHE HAD A VERY INTERESTING TIME AS OUT IN WASHINGTON WORKING FOR THE NOT NAVAL THE AIR FORCE THE WREN WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE YES YES LIKE THE UNIFORM TOO YEAH JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT IT AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE AND THEN THE WORK AND STUFF ERM WELL ERM AS SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF DESIGNER IN THE BEGINNING UM IT WAS A QUESTION OF DOING M TYPING HE WOULD DICTATE HIS DESIGN M REPORTS BECAUSE IT ALL HAD TO GO UP TO THE AIR MINISTRY FOR APPROVAL BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR EM AN ORDER FOR THESE PLANES OF COURSE AND IT WAS TYPING ALL THESE SHEETS OF DESCRIPTION OF THESE PLANES EM AND THAT I MEAN TO SAY HE WAS A VERY UNDISCIPLINED MAN IN THAT HE LEFT EVERYTHING TO THE LAST MINUTE SO ONE WAS WORKING QUITE LATE AT NIGHT VERY OFTEN TO GET IT DONE TO THE DEADLINE THAT THE MINISTRY HAD SET THAT WAS HIS NAME BASIL HENDERSON AND HE DESIGNED A SMALL PLANE CALLED THE UM WHAT DID THEY CALL IT UM THE HENDY IT WAS A BREAKDOWN OF HIS NAME IT WAS BASIL HEN UM IT'LL COME TO ME BUT IT WAS ROUND ABOUT THE TIME THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER CHAP DESIGNING THOSE SMALL PLANES M I CAN'T THINK OF HIS NAME NOW BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THE WAR WAS COMING UM NOT REALLY NO I MEAN TO SAY THE BOYS THAT WE USED TO MEET AND MIX WITH WERE MOSTLY ERM AIRFORCE TYPES OR GOING INTERESTED IN THE AIR FORCE AND WE KNEW IT WAS THE FIVE O ONE SQUADRON AT FILTON M THAT MOST OF THEM FLEW WITH EM AND WE KNEW AT TIMES FROM THEIR CONVERSATION THAT THINGS WERE GETTING VERY NEAR BUT ERM NOT REALLY NO NO YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T PUTTING UP THE BARRICADES OR ANYTHING WHAT ABOUT THE OUTBREAK OF WAR DO YOU REMEMBER THAT I DO WE WERE ACTUALLY ON FILTON AERODROME THEN THAT SUNDAY WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED IT WATCHING THESE LADS IN THEIR PLANES TAKING OFF PURELY FOR EXERCISE SO I MEAN DID THINGS CHANGE IN BRISTOL WHEN WAR BROKE OUT WHAT WAS THE CHANGE DO YOU REMEMBER I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY BECAUSE MOST OF MY LIFE WAS SPENT BETWEEN FISH PONDS AND YET YOU KNOW I VERY RARELY WENT THE OTHER WAY TOWARDS TOWN AND DIDN'T REALLY GET ANY FEELING OF WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE EVEN YOU KNOW I READ NOW ABOUT SOME OF THE GHASTLY THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBING YOU KNOW THE LOSS OF LIFE BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME DIRECTLY UM MY PARENTS HAD A SHOP IN FISH PONDS AND THEY STILL KEPT GOING YOU KNOW IN A QUIET SORT OF WAY DID YOU SEE THE BLITZ DID YOU SEE WERE YOU IN WERE YOU IN ATE WHEN IT YES I WAS IN AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FIRM MOVED US TO LIVE IN ATE SO WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BUSINESS OF TRAVELLING UM BUT WE DID HAVE A DAYLIGHT RAID IN YATES AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC UM THEY SENT A SINGLE PLANE I SAY WE WERE ALL WORKING AWAY QUITE HAPPILY IN THE AIR RAID SIREN WENT AND I WAS BEING TAUGHT HOW TO PLAY BRIDGE BY THE FRIEND WHO WENT INTO THE AIR FORCE AND ERM WE DIDN'T TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE ARRA TIRING BECAUSE WE'D NEVER HAD ANYTHING AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS THE MOST ALMIGHTY EXPLOSION AND THE WHOLE BUILDING SHOOK AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED A SINGLE PLANE HAD COME IN APPARENTLY IT CAME IN FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTHERN FRANCE AREA WHERE THE GERMANS HAD ERM AIRPORTS AND HAD FLOWN UP THE BRISTOL CHANNEL SOMEWHERE NORTH OF GLOUCESTER PICKED UP THE RAILWAY LINE AND YATES RUNS ALONG THE RAILWAY LINE IF YOU KNOW THE BUILDING AND FLEW DOWN AND DROPPED THIS STRIP OF BOMBS ALONG THE FACTORY FORTUNATELY A COUPLE OF THEM DID GO OFF AND I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SEEING A DEAD BODY BECAUSE I KNEW MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FACTORY BECAUSE OF WHO I WAS WORKING FOR AND ONE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOUSE IN CHIPPING STORY WAS A WOMAN CALLED SISTER HOBBS WHO BECAME QUITE WELL KNOWN FOR THE WORK SHE DID IN THAT LIZ AND SHE JUST GOT HOLD OF ME AND SHE SAID COME ON WE'VE GOT TO GO UP TO THE BRICK FACTORY SHE SAID TO IDENTIFY THESE PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN KILLED AND YOU KNOW I WAS TAKEN WHAT WAS I IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE SO LIKE TWENTY TWO AT TWENTY TWO TO SEE ALL THESE DISINTEGRATED BODIES AND I HADN'T SEEN A DEAD BODY BEFORE AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC YEAH WAS THAT DO YOU THINK A CATALYST OF THINKING I WANT TO JOIN AND BECOME A WREN NO I DON'T THINK SO NO NO THAT WAS QUIETLY SIMMERING AWAY AND I THINK THE CATALYST IN THE END WAS WHEN MY BOSS MOVED HE WENT TO A FIRM WHICH AGAIN YOU MAY KNOW OF BOOZE AND HAWKS THEY RM HE WASN'T A MUSICIAN OR HE HADN'T MADE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE JOB THEY DID ORIGINALLY THEY WERE MAKING SPARE PARTS FOR SOME OF OUR GUN TURRETS AND THEY FOUND THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD DESIGN WHAT THEY WANTED AND THEY GOT HIM THEY HAD HUNTED HIM AND WHEN HE LEFT I WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH A PERSON WHO GOT THE JOB AND I THOUGHT I WANT TO MOVE BUT I HAD TO WORK QUITE HARD TO GET INTO THE WRENS BECAUSE OF COURSE I WAS IN A RESERVED OCCUPATION I WAS GOING TO ASK WAS IT OVER I ASSUMED IT WAS A RESERVED OCCUPATION SO YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCEDURE TO GET OUT YES AND THEY WEREN'T THE WRENS WEREN'T OPEN FOR RECRUITMENT ANYHOW AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE BEING ERM ER DRAWN I SUPPOSE IS THE WORD FOR THE BY WAR ARTIST A MAN CALLED LEOPOLD FREEDMAN I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RUN TO EARTH SINCE I'VE TRIED BECAUSE HE DID LIKE A MURAL OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THE FACTORY AND IT WENT TO THE NATIONAL WHAT'S THE ONE IN TRAFALGAR NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE EM AND UM I WAS SITTING YOU KNOW WHILE HE WAS DRAWING ME AND TALKING TO HIM AND I SAID I WANTED TO JOIN THE WRENS AND THE PROBLEM WAS THERE WERE NO VACANCIES AND I WAS IN A RESERVED ACIDIC SO HE GAVE ME THE NAME OF A WOMAN AGAIN I FORGOTTEN HER NAME BUT SHE WAS HEAD OF THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR IN LONDON SO I'D GO OFF TO LONDON TO SEE THIS WOMAN AND SHE TOLD SHE TOLD ME THE SORT OF INSIDE SECRET THAT I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN FAIRLY SOON BECAUSE THE WRENS WERE EXPANDING AND THEY EXPANDED VERY RAPIDLY AND I GOT IN VERY EASILY THEN BUT I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THE DOORS OPEN BECAUSE THE LORDS OF THE ADMIRALTY DIDN'T WANT WOMEN YOU KNOW THEY RELUCTANTLY TOOK THEM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR BUT YOU KNOW IT WAS A MAN SERVICE IT WASN'T FOR WOMEN BRILLIANT SO WHAT WAS THE PROCESS THEN FROM TRANSITIONING FROM BEING A SECRETARY IN TO BECOMING A WREN WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF IT YES I REMEMBER YOU HAVING MY PAPERS BEING SENT TO LEEDS BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY SUDDENLY EXPANDED THEY HAD TO OPEN NEW TRAINING DEPOTS I WAS IN MY EARLY TWENTIES AND UM I HAD WHAT THEY CALL A WHITE PAPER EM WHICH WAS A RECOMMENDATION FOR A COMMISSION AS SOON AS YOU WERE INTERVIEWED ORIGINALLY YOU KNOW MOST GIRLS HAVE TO WAIT AND WORK A WHILE BUT I WAS OLDER AND I THINK THEY SAW ME AS A POSSIBLE ADMIN OFFICER WELL THEY DID ACTUALLY BUT THEN I WENT FROM LEEDS AFTER I DID MY BASIC TRAINING TO ROCHESTER WHICH IS REALLY THE CHATHAM NOW I HAD SEEN MYSELF IS BOAT'S CREW YOU KNOW AND BECAUSE I WAS A BRISTOLAN I WANTED TO GO TO PLYMOUTH WHICH WAS UM BUT THE NAVY HAD OTHER IDEAS SO THEY SENT ME TO BE TO GO TO TRAINING FOR AN ADMIRING OFFICER AT CHATHAM REALLY ERM ANYHOW THEY PUT ME IN WHAT'S CALLED THE REGULATING OFFICE WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHERE YOU MONITOR PEOPLE COMING IN AND GOING OUT AND TELEPHONES AND UM I ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THE FIRST OFFICER WHO WAS THE ONE IN CHARGE WAS A VERY VERY DO WOMAN AND SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER FOR SOMEBODY CALLED LADY BURTON SHAW WHO LIVED IN HOVE AND EVERY SATURDAY AFTERNOON LADY BURTON SHAW WOULD RING UP HER DAUGHTER JUST FOR A CHAT AND I WAS PUT ON THE TELEPHONE WELL I NEVER WORKED YOU KNOW THOSE PLUGGING TELEPHONES I NEVER WORKED ONE OF THOSE AND OF COURSE LADY BURTONSHAW COMES THROUGH AND I WAS A PANIC YOU KNOW I WASN'T VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT IT AND OF COURSE WHAT DID I DO IN A VERY MIDDLE OF THEIR CONVERSATION I PULLED THE PLUG OUT YOU SEE SO I HAD TO GO IN SHE CALLED ME IN AND SHE SAID WHO'S ON THE TELEPHONE SO I SAID IT WAS ME MAM SO YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A BROKEN REED AND I THOUGHT WELL NOBODY HAS EVER CALLED ME A BROKEN REED BEFORE BUT YOU KNOW IT DID ME A WORLD OF GOOD I THOUGHT I WAS GOD'S GIFT TO THE NAVY YOU SEE AND I WASN'T A BUT THAT REMARK REALLY HAS STUCK WITH ME ALL MY LIFE SAID WERE YOU WERE YOU ASSUME FROM WERE YOU AT CHATHAM RATING YES I DO YOU KNOW UM I SUPPOSE I WAS NO COMMAND IT WAS DID YOU GO TO CHATHAM WELL NOT ONLY IN SORT OF VISIT BECAUSE WE WERE BILLETED IN ROCHESTER AND BECAUSE I WAS DOING THE ADMIN WORK IN THE OFFICE THE OFFICE WAS ATTACHED TO THE ERM BILLET HOW DID YOU FIND MOVING AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE YOU BEEN OUT OF BRISTOL AT THIS POINT M NOT VERY FAR NO THAT WAS ANOTHER THING YOU DIDN'T TRAVEL FAR YOU KNOW HOLIDAYS WERE WELL THE FURTHEST WE WENT WAS TENBY IN SOUTH WALES BUT I HAD BEEN TO LONDON ERM AND I HAD BEEN TO FRANCE ON THE SCHOOL TRIP EM ONCE ERM BUT NO NOT VERY FAR WE WEREN'T VERY WELL OFF ANYHOW AS A FAMILY YOU KNOW WE HAD TO CUT OUR CORNERS SO AFTER ROCHESTER THEN WHERE DID YOU WHERE DID YOU GO THEN WELL WHEN I WAS AT ROCHESTER M THE FIRST OFFICER I WAS TELLING YOU CALLED ME A BROKEN READ EM I WAS IN THE UM WHAT DO THEY CALL IT NOW SORT OF THE OFFICE WHICH ALLOCATED POSTINGS TO THE GIRLS BECAUSE ALL THE GIRLS THERE WERE WAITING TO BE SENT SOMEWHERE UM AND I WAS THERE AND NOTHING CAME IN BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAME IN FROM THE ADMIRALTY AND NOTHING CAME IN I WAS INTERESTED IN I WAS DOWN FOR AN AND THEN I FOUND THAT TO DO HAD ME AND I HAD TO GO TO M LOWESTOFT TO THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE WHERE THEY TRAINED ADMIRAL OFFICERS AND I FOUND THERE WAS A LONG WAITING LIST AND I THOUGHT WELL I DIDN'T JOIN THE NAVY TO SIT IN AN OFFICE AND WAIT FOR THAT SO I WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO AND I SAID NO SO THEY SAID WELL YOU REALIZE YOU'LL GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST I SAID WELL I DIDN'T JOIN TO HAVE A COMMISSION ANYHOW YOU KNOW I JOIN YOU TO DO A JOB SO SHE SAID TO ME IF YOU SEE ANYTHING COMING THROUGH IT WAS A TELE PRINTER IN THOSE DAYS LET ME KNOW AND I'LL SEE I SAID WELL ALL I KNOW IS I DON'T WANT TO WORK IN LONDON I DON'T MIND WHERE ELSE I GO AND YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO STICK WITH MY SHORTHAND AND A SORT OF GENERAL OFFICE WORK OK SHE SAID SO INCOMES IT WAS AT THE TIME WHEN GENERAL EISENHOWER WAS ERM GETTING TO BE QUITE WELL KNOWN AS A COMMANDER AND HE SET UP IF YOU REMEMBER CHEF AND I LOOKED AT SOMETHING CAME IN WITH AN F STROKE CHEF AND I THOUGHT WELL THAT'S INTERESTING AND THE ANC WAS THE ALLIED NAVAL COMMANDER EXPEDITIONARY FORCE AND THAT WAS ADMIRAL RAMSEY AND I THOUGHT WELL THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING YOU KNOW SO I'M GOING TO LIE COULD I HAVE MY NAME PUT UP FOR THAT VACANCY AND SO SHE AGREED AND YOU KNOW YOU HAD TO TAKE YOUR CHANCE WHAT OTHER APPLICATIONS THEY HAD AND EM I GOT IT AND I SAID WHERE IS IT SO SHE SAID WELL TO START WITH YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO NORFOLK SQUARE IN LONDON WHICH IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF CHEF AND THE ANC GROUP WERE COLLECTING THERE AND THEY WERE MOSTLY WRENS WHO WERE GOING TO DO THE D DAY PLANNING BUT I GOT BECAUSE I PUT IN FOR AN STROKE SHAPE I GOT ATTACHED TO THE THIS IS WHERE ADMIRAL PARRY CAME IN TO ADMIRAL PARRY WHO TYPICALLY BRITISH WE HADN'T STARTED D DAY BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS ALREADY POST OPERATIVE PLANNING AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS I THOUGHT WELL WE HAVEN'T WON THE WAR WHY ARE THEY PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE YOU SEE AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS CAUGHT UP IN THAT FROM THEN ON I WAS ATTACHED TO HIM AND SENT TO BUSHY PARK IN HERTFORDSHIRE NOT HERTFORDSHIRE ERM IT'S NEAR HAMPTON COURT PALACE AND IT WAS GENERALIZING HOW HEADQUARTERS FOR THEY WERE COLLECTING ALL THE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE PEOPLE THERE YOU KNOW WELL THE TROOPS WERE BEING COLLECTED AROUND KENTON SUSSEX AND PLACE SORRY IT'S MY NERVES THEY DON'T ERM AND ERM I SAW I DON'T WANT TO GO TO LONDON BUT ANYHOW IN THE END THEY SAID WELL YOU'LL ONLY BE HELD THERE UNTIL UM AND I WAS ONLY HELD THERE A DAY MEMBER SITTING ON THE WALL OUTSIDE NORFOLK HOUSE WHICH IS WHERE THE LONDON GROUP WHERE AND TOLD TO WAIT AND SOMEBODY WOULD PICK ME UP BECAUSE FROM THEN ON IT BECAME HIGHLY SECRETIVE I WAS SITTING LIKE A ONLY WREN WAS MY NAVAL CASE AND NOTHING ELSE AND A JEEP CAME ZOOMING AROUND THE ERM SQUARE AND AN AMERICAN STOPPED BY ME AND HE SAID ARE YOU RE AND IRENE BELGO AND A BUSHY PARK WELL I SAID I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING I'VE JUST BEEN TOLD TO SIT ON THIS WALL SO HE SAID HE GOT ME ABOARD HIS JEEP AND WE WENT THROUGH THAT IT WASN'T FAR FROM NORFOLK TO GET OUT OF LONDON WENT TO BUSHY PARK IT WAS AND OF COURSE WHEN I GET TO BUSHY PARK I'M THE ONLY WREN THERE BECAUSE IT WAS A SEPARATE UNIT TO THE BIG GROUP THEY WERE AT NORFOLK HOUSE WHAT YEAR WAS THE ER FORTY FOUR I THINK FORTY FOUR FORTY FIVE YEAH YOU JUST DESCRIBE THE SET UP OF BUSHY PARK AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE BEFORE D DAY UM WELL BUSHY PARK UM I PRESUME IT'S A SORT OF LOCAL IT 'S A VERY LARGE PARK AND IN IT WERE PORTER CABINS IN WHICH BY THEN YOU'D GOT THE BRITISH AND THE FRENCH AND THE AMERICANS WHO WERE THE FORCE OF AN NOT US CANADIANS YES WELL THERE WERE A FEW BUT NOT MANY BUT I WAS THINKING OF THE GROUP THEY SPLIT GERMANY UP INTO REGIONS DIDN'T THEY THERE WAS THE BRITISH RUSSIA RUSSIANS BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER RUSSIANS BEING AT BUSHY PARK I THINK THEY LINKED UP LATER BUT I REMEMBER BEING IN IN ONE OF THESE WE HAD OUR OFFICE AND THIS IS WHERE I DIDN'T ACTUALLY COULDN'T SAY I MET HIM BUT ERM THE DOODLE BUGS HAD STARTED FLYING AND ERM THEY GOT THEY HAD BUSHY PARK IN THEIR SIGHTS AND THEY GOT VERY NEAR US BUT SO THEY WERE AIR RAID SHELTERS BUILT SPECIALLY AND A LOT OF THE AMERICANS PARTICULARLY THE WOMEN IN THE AMERICAN ARMY HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE AND THEY JUST WENT TO PIECES IF THERE WAS AN AIR RAID THEY WERE TERRIBLY NERVOUS LOT EM BUT I QUITE ENJOYED BEING WITH THEM BECAUSE IT WAS A DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE ALL TOGETHER THE METHOD OF EATING ON THE EQUIPMENT THEY GAVE US YOU KNOW IN THE HYGENE THAT WAS PUT IN UM SO I WAS I WAS UNDER AIR ERM TS SUPERVISION ER AND SOMEBODY CALLED LADY BRECKNOCK I THINK SHE BECAME QUITE A POWER IN THE LAND AFTERWARDS FROM A POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW BUT SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF US AND SHE AND I RESENTED HER BECAUSE SHE SHE USED TO OPEN MY POST WHICH OF COURSE THE NAVY NEVER OPENED YOUR POST BUT OF COURSE BECAUSE I WAS UNDER ATS RULE ALL OUR POST WAS OENED ERM LADY BLOCK ALWAYS MADE A POINT OF READING AND REMEMBERING WHAT WAS IN AND I WAS ALWAYS SENDING HOME FOR MONEY AND SHE WAS ALWAYS SAYING YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED MONEY YOU'VE GOT PLENTY EVEN THOUGH YOU SHOULD MANAGE ON WHAT YOU'VE GOT AND THAT WAS SEVEN AND SIX A WEEK SO FROM FROM THERE ERM DID YOU MEET ISEN WELL YES NO I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE DOODLE BUGS AND IF HE WAS ON SIGHT IN HIS OFFICE HE DIDN'T COME VERY OFTEN BECAUSE OF COURSE HIS RESPONSIBILITY WAS ENORMOUS AND THE PLACES YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAID OH EISENHOWER WAS THERE BUT THEY WERE NEVER THERE FOR LONG BUT HE DID USE THE AIR RAID SHELTER WHICH WAS THE SAME SHELTER THAT WE USED BECAUSE WE WERE IN A JOINING OFFICES UM BUT YOU KNOW HE HARDLY SAW US M BECAUSE HE POPPED DOWN AND ALL HIS ENTOURAGE WOULD BE WITH HIM BUT I MEAN TO SAY WE DIDN'T FEEL WE WERE LESS THAN HIM YOU KNOW HE ALWAYS HAD A WORD TO SAY BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY SAY YOU MET HIM YOU KNOW WHEN DID COME ON HARRY COME TO YOU SEE EM NOT ACTUALLY IN AND I WENT ACROSS TO TO FRANCE BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME HIS ONE OF HIS SIDEKICKS WAS A CAPTAIN OWEN WHO HAD BEEN THE ERM PORTUGUESE ER THE IT WASN'T AN ATTACHE I THOUGHT THE NAVAL REPRESENTATIVE IN LISBON EM AND SO WHEN HE JOINED US ON THE STAFF OF ADMIRAL PARRY I WAS ATTACHED TO HIM AND HE ALWAYS CALLED ME HIS MARINE YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY SPOKEN TO A PORTUGUESE TO FIND OUT I WAS TOLD IT MEANT FRIEND BUT ERM I WAS ALWAYS SAID HE ALWAYS TOLD PEOPLE IF THEY WANTED SOMETHING GO AND ASK MY MARINE BUT HE HE WAS A VERY GENTLE VERY NICE MAN WHO ABOUT WHOM I KNEW NEVER HEARD MUCH ABOUT HIM AT ALL I KNOW ADMIRAL PARRY ERM AT THE END OF THE WAR UM I THINK HE WAS AN APPLE GROWER IN KENT AND THAT'S HIS RETIREMENT THAT'S WHAT HE DID BUT CAPTAIN ON I NEVER KNEW WHAT DID YOU SENSE WHAT DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS ESCALATION TOWARDS D DAY HOW HOW SORT OF PRIVY TO IT WERE YOU OH ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I WASN'T IN THE TYPING POOL AS IT WAS UM I KNEW I'D SEEN PAPERS GOING THROUGH AND YOU KNEW WHAT THE PLANNING WAS AND YOU SAY IT WAS TOP SECRET JUST DESCRIBE THE SECRECY PROCESS WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO BE YOU KNOW WE LET IT YEAH ERM WELL IT WAS A BIGOT WAS THE THE THIRD LEVEL WHICH WAS THE ABSOLUTELY I DON'T THINK WE COULD EVER GET THROUGH THERE WERE SPECIAL LINES AND THINGS ON THE TELEPHONE AND IT WAS MOSTLY FOR USE BY TELEPHONE BUT I NEVER REALLY KNEW HOW THEY DECIDED I KNEW WHEN I HAD TO IF I HAD TO MAKE A CALL WHICH LINE I HAD TO USE WHETHER IT WAS THE ORDINARY ONE THE TOP SECRET OR BIGGER BUT I NEVER KNEW WHEN SAY CAPTAIN ON WAS WANTING ME TO DO SOMETHING AND HE SAID THAT 'LL BE BIGGER HOW HE KNEW IT HAD TO BE BIGGER NOW THAT WAS SOMETHING KNOWN TO HIM IS BEING ABOVE TOP SECRET YES YES JUST DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR JOB WAS THEN WHAT WERE YOU ACTUALLY DOING M PREDOMINANT IN LONDON OR A WELL MAINLY EM DOING THEM ADMIRALS OR CAPTAIN WHICHEVER ONE WAS DOING THEM THEIR POST AND AND TAKING DICTATION AND WHAT PLANNING THEY HAD TO DO IN TERMS OF POST OFF MOST OF THE POST OPERATIVE STUFF WAS THE DIVISION OF THE GERMAN NAVY WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER YOU KNOW WHO WAS GOING TO HAVE WHAT AND THAT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE OF COURSE THE RUSSIANS WANTED EVERYTHING THIS WAS MUCH FURTHER ON WHEN WE WERE IN BERLIN BUT THE RUSSIANS ALWAYS WANTED ALL THE BIG STUFF YOU KNOW AND WE KNEW ALL THE BEST EQUIPMENT WAS IN THE SMALLER DESTROYERS AND THINGS SO ERM WE WENT FOR THOSE M SO YOU KNOW THEY WERE WORKING OUT ALL THOSE SORT OF THINGS AND OF COURSE IT ALL HAD TO GO UP THROUGH THE ADMIRALTY AND BACK AGAIN SO IT ALL TOOK TIME BUT IT WAS JUST STRAIGHTFORWARD SHORTHAND REPORTING WHAT THE POST OPERATIVE PLANNING EVEN BEFORE D DAY YEAH DID YOU DID YOU EVER MEET ANY YOU KNOW WERE THERE ANY OTHER LIKE CHURCHILL ANY OF THE OTHER BIG WIGS THE BIG NEVER SAW CHURCHILL ERM MONTGOMERY UM WE WHEN WE WERE IN GERMANY IT WAS THE FASHION TO HAVE A DOG AND I NEVER HAD ONE BUT MY FRIEND HAD ONE WHICH SHE CALLED FRAT BECAUSE THAT OF COURSE WAS NO FRATERNIZATION UM AND I REMEMBER WE HAD AN OFFICE WE WERE IN FRANKFORT AT THE TIME AND THE OFFICE THERE HAD A SORT OF STAIRCASE GOING UP AND PADDY ALWAYS TOOK FRAT TO WORK NOBODY MINDED BECAUSE THE WAR WAS OVER BY THEN AND WE WERE GOING UPSTAIRS ONE DAY AND SOME OF THESE SAID WATCH OUT MONTGOMERY'S COMING AND HE WAS IN THE BUILDING AT SOME MEETING AND HE WAS COMING AGAIN WITH HIS NOSE DOWN STAIRS AS WE WERE GOING UP YOU SEE AND ERM APPARENTLY HE DIDN'T DO IT IN FRONT OF US BUT WHEN HE GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE HE TOLD HIS ADJUTANT TO CONTACT WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WRENS TO SAY HE DIDN'T WANT DOGS IN THE BUILDING IT WAS A DIFFICULT THEM SO IF YOU YOU WERE VERY PRIVY TO ALL THIS STUFF WE WHEN DID YOU KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BE JUNE THE OR SIX DID YOU KNOW THAT M WELL YES BECAUSE YOU KNOW OF THE DELAY DO YOU MEAN YES BECAUSE OF THE DELAY YOU KNOW YES BUT YOU SO YOU KNEW THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE DAY THAT THE LANDINGS WERE HAPPENING DID YOU EVER GO YES WELL IT WAS IT YOU DID AND YOU DIDN'T YOU KNOW THERE WERE ALWAYS THINGS BEING SAID TO PUT YOU OFF SO YOU WENT A HUNDRED PERCENT SHORE BUT ER WELL I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYBODY WAS REALLY BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER AND THINGS BUT WE WERE WHEN I WAS AT CHATHAM AND THERE WASN'T YOU KNOW WE'D DONE ALL THE WORK WE HAD TO DO AND WE WERE WAITING UM WE WERE SENT CHERRY PICKING IN THE KENT ORCHARDS AND THAT WAS AMAZING BECAUSE ALL THE LANES AND ROADS ALL ROUND SORT OF KENT AND THE SORT OF AREA GOING DOWN TO THE COAST WERE FULL OF ARMY VEHICLES AND MEN WAITING AND ER YOU KNEW THAT THEY WERE THERE READY TO GO BUT I THINK THAT'S HOW I LEARNED RATHER THAN THROUGH THE OFFICE SO AFTER BUSH AT YOU WENT BACK TO CHATHAM DID YOU BACK OVER TO NO BUSH I'VE GOT TO GET THERE BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEEM NO FROM BUSHY PARK M WE WERE MOVED BACK TO LONDON AND I WORKED IN PRINCES GARDENS THERE AND WE LIVED IN ENGLAND LANE IN SORT OF ENGLAND'S LANE IT SORT OF SWISS COTTAGE WAY AND THERE WAS A NURSES HOME THERE I THINK IT WAS A CHERRY CROSS NURSES HOME AND THEY USED THAT FOR WREN BILLET AND WE USED TO TRAVEL TRAVELLED TO UM PRINCES GARDENS FROM THERE AND IT WAS FROM PRINCES GARDENS THAT I WAS DRAFTED OVER TO FRANCE CAN YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU FELT WHEN YOU FOUND OUT YOU'D BE GOING FOLLOWING THE EXPEDITION I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I FELT THAT I AM STILL THAT MY NAVAL LIFE WAS ANYTHING BUT NAVY YOU KNOW THOUGH IT WAS BECAUSE I HAD GREAT GREAT IDEAS OF BEING A BOAT'S CREW AS I SAID GOING TO SEA WITH E MAIL ERM SO I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE INLAND AS IT WER BUT ONCE I GOT USED TO IT AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN ADVENTURE AS WELL IN GOING OVER DID YOU SAIL TO FRANCE WE WENT YOU KNOW THOSE EM BOATS THEY TOOK THE TROOPS OVER WE WENT OVER BECAUSE ACTUALLY ERM WHEN IT CAME TO IT THE WAR WAS THAT THE ARMY WAS ALMOST IN BERLIN BY THEN SO THEY FELT IT WAS SAFE TO PUT THE GIRLS OVER EM WE WENT ACROSS TO A LITTLE TOWN IN NORMANDY CALLED GRAVEL ON THE WERE DUCKS WE CALLED THEM YOU KNOW DKK THOSE ERM LIKE LANDING CRAFT AND I WAS TERRIBLY SICK I MAY SAY IT PROVED TO ME I WASN'T A SAILOR THEY WERE DESCRIBE THE SORT OF THE DAY YOU WENT ON THE LANDING CRUST TO FRANCE JUST GOING BACK A LITTLE BIT ON A STORY AND WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF YOU KNOW THAT DAY WHERE DID YOU SAIL FROM AND WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LIKE ET CETERA CAN YOU REMEMBER YES THE WEATHER WASN'T TOO GOOD HENCE THE FACT THAT I WAS UM I SUPPOSE I THINK THERE WERE PROBABLY NEARLY BETWEEN FIFTY AND A HUNDRED OF US GOING NOT ONLY WRENS BUT I WAS UM TO THINK WE WENT FROM ERM ONE ONE OF THE UM LITTLE PORTS THEY WEREN'T REALLY PORTS WERE AROUND THE BLEY RIVER THAT THAT WAY UM WE WERE EXCITED WE DIDN'T YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAD ALL SORTS OF IMAGINATIONS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN CROSSING THE CHANNEL MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO SWIM FAR ENOUGH AND UNDER YOU KNOW THEY DID WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WATER WHEN WE GOT THE OTHER SIDE LIKE YOU SEE THE MEN YOU KNOW TRAILING OUT WITH ALL THEIR STUFF TO WATER THEY MANAGED TO BEACH US SO WE WERE QUITE DRY WHEN WE GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU KNOW THE FRENCH ACTUALLY IN NORMANDY WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING THEY WERE VERY PLEASED TO SEE US THEY WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN MY VIEW TO THE ONES WE MET IN PARIS WAS IT OBVIOUSLY WATER OH YES YES YOU KNOW THE UM BECAUSE IT WOULD BE AFTER D DAY OF COURSE WE WEREN'T ACROSS SO THINGS WERE STILL PRETTY BROKEN YOU KNOW ALL THE ERM ER SORT OF FRONT LINE HOUSES AND THINGS WERE ALL BASHED ABOUT BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN BOMBARDED OF COURSE FROM THE SEA AND AND AND GRANVILLE WHAT WAS THE SET UP THERE AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE STILL IN A WAR WAR ZONE BASICALLY AREN'T YOU YEAH IT WAS A WAR ZONE WELL IT WAS IT WAS JUST A SORT OF GETTING OFF POINT FOR MOVING PEOPLE ON BEHIND THE ARMY I THINK IT WAS FELT TO BE A REASONABLE PLACE TO START MOVING BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF EQUIPMENT AS WELL WE DIDN'T BUT THE ARMY AND THE AIR FORCE AND THE NAVY FOR THAT MATTER ALL HAD EQUIPMENT TO MOVE UP WITH US ERM AND I THINK GRANVILLE PROBABLY HAD AT A LITTLE TOWN WAS CONSIDERED YOU KNOW THEY HAD ERM GOOD NOT GOOD BUT THE TRANSPORT SITUATION MOVING STUFF WAS REASONABLE BUT VERY BASIC LIVING CONDITIONS YOU KNOW WE HAD NO RUNNING WATER OR M WE HAD SORT OF THINGS LIKE YOUR TRIPOD WITH CANVAS BAGS IN THE LOOK WE USE LESS WASHING ERM MACHINE ERM WELL RM FOR WASHING WHAT ELSE WAS THERE IT WAS LIKE CAMPING REALLY FROM A LIVING POINT OF VIEW AND VERY LITTLE WORK WE HAD AT THAT TIME AND WHAT WERE YOU JUST WRITING OR DID YOU HAVE TELLY PRINTERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WAS THERE ANY TECHNOLOGY SO OH YES THERE WAS A LOT BUT NOT IN THE GROUP I WAS WITH YOU KNOW ACTUALLY THE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO GO OVER WITH THE COMMUNICATORS UM TELEPHONE OPERATORS AND SO ON AND OF COURSE THEY WERE STILL THE ENGINEERS WERE STILL FITTING UP FIELD UM EQUIPMENT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND THERE WERE A LOT OF ER WRENS IN THAT GROUP TREMENDOUS NUMBER AND ERM FROM GRAVEL EM YOU KNOW THEY FOUND THAT THE WORK THEY WANTED ME TO DO WAS MORE CENTRED BACK IN LONDON SO I WAS SHIPPED BACK TO LONDON TO WAIT UNTIL THEY'D ER PREPARED WHAT WE NEEDED EM OR I HAD TO HELP DO THAT ERM AND WE WENT THEN ER TO PARIS ER BUT I WENT FROM LONDON FROM ENGLAND'S LANE THAT WAS TO ERM PARIS ON MY OWN AND THEN I REALLY WAS I'D NOT BEEN ANYWHERE ON MY OWN BEFORE AND THE I WAS MET WHEN I GOT TO UM THE GARGENORE BECAUSE I WENT OVER ON THE TRAIN ERM BY ANOTHER WREN WHO'D BEEN OVER AND THEN WE WERE I WAS BILLETED AND WORKED IN A CHATEAU IN UM WELL IT'S A SUBURB OF PARIS ANYHOW QUITE M AND I WORKED THERE FOR A VERY SHORT TIME AND THEN THE ERM ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP WERE FOLLOWING ON BEHIND THE ARMY AND WE WENT FROM ERM PARIS TO FRANKFURT AND M I DIDN'T ENJOY FRANKFORT VERY MUCH BECAUSE THERE WASN'T MUCH TO DO BY NOW YOU KNOW MOST OF THE PLANNING HAD BEEN DONE AND LIFE BECAME RATHER SORT OF THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY POINT IN WHAT WE WERE DOING WE'D DONE IT ALL YOU KNOW SO IT WAS A BIT OF A PLAYGROUND WAS THIS AT THE END OF IS THIS AFTER THE WAR YEAH I MAY SAY THE THE EM TROOPS THAT HAD ENTERED BERLIN UM AND WE WERE BACK IN PARIS SO IT WAS SORT OF JUST AS THE WAR WAS ENDING THE FIRST AND YES IT HAD ENDED BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME IN PARIS M WE WERE THE FASHION AS YOU KNOW THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HATS MADE OUT OF SELIFANE PAPER YOU KNOW SWEET PAPERS AND THINGS THAT THE WOMEN HAD MADE THEY SEEMED UNTOUCHED BY THE WAR IN PARIS THEY DIDN'T MUCH LIKE US I DON'T THINK I THINK THE GERMANS HAD GIVEN THEM QUITE A GOOD TIME YOU WITH ADMIRAL PARRY THEN AT THIS POINT NO I MET ADMIRAL PARRY WHEN I GOT TO PARIS WERE TEENS AS A PERSON VERY QUIET YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T REALLY FEEL YOU KNOW HE COULD HIT ANYBODY TO KILL ANYBODY BUT ERM AND OR EVEN DISCIPLINE ANYBODY HE WAS ALWAYS VERY GENTLE AND VERY NICE TO WORK FOR BUT VERY CLEVER OF COURSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WANTED AND JUST DESCRIBE SORT OF WORKING RELATIONSHIP WHAT YOU DID FOR HIM AND THE PURPOSE OF YOUR BEING THERE WAS DO YOU MEAN EM YOU SEE MOST OF THE GRAPH HE HE REALLY WOULD HAVE COMMUNICATED TO CAPTAIN OWN MOST OF WHAT HE WANTED BECAUSE HE'D BE OFF DOING SOMETHING ELSE BUT ER SO THE CAPTAIN OWEN WAS REALLY THE PERSON WHO WAS GIVING ME WORK WHEN THERE WAS WORK TO BE DONE BUT A ADMIRAL PARRY CERTAINLY WAS VERY APPROACHABLE YOU KNOW AND HE MIXED WITH US THERE WAS NO SORT OF OFFICERS AND OTHERS ERM EVERYBODY MIXED AND ER HE IS A DIFFICULT MAN TO DESCRIBE REALLY THAT'S NICELY DESCRIBED I THINK YEAH YOU KNOW BUT WHEN WE WERE IN BERLIN YOU KNOW BERLIN AT ALL IN THE LAKES THE VANS THE LAKES THAT ARE ON THE OUTSKIRTS WELL WHEN WE WERE LIVING IN WHAT HAD BEEN THE JAPANESE EMBASSY IN BERLIN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AND IT WAS IN THAT DISTRICT WHERE THE LAKES WERE BUT I ALWAYS SAID THE VANS ERM LAKES AND THEY WOULD FREEZE OVER IN THE WINTER BECAUSE WE HAD A WINTER THERE AND YOU KNOW THE ADMIRAL WOULD ARRANGE SKATING PARTIES AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE THE ICE THERE SO THICK BECAUSE IT WAS SO COLD YOU COULD HAVE BARBECUE WAS ON THE ICE AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE LIFE BECAME A BIT SUPERFICIAL ERM LATTERLY WHEN THERE WASN'T MUCH WORK TO DO YOU KNOW YOU REALLY FELT YOU SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE DOING SOME WORK AND HOW DID YOU GET FROM PARIS INTO FRANKFORT THEN ARE YOU ON RAILWAYS WERE YOU IN VEHICLES OR OH IN NAVAL JEEPS MOST OF THE TRAVELLING WAS IN THE ONLY ONLY THING WHEN I WENT FROM FRANKFURT TO BERLIN I HAD BEEN HOME ON LEAVE AND WHEN I GOT BACK UM IT WAS TO FIND THAT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY THEY COULDN'T ERM NOTIFY ME THEY COULDN'T GET HOLD OF ME TO LET ME KNOW THAT THE MAIN PARTY HAD GONE ON TO BERLIN AND WHEN I GOT BACK TO FRANKFORT I HAD TO GO AND REPORT TO ONE OF THE ARMY OFFICERS TO GET TRANSPORT AND WHEN I GOT THERE I FOUND A MESSAGE TO SAY THAT GENERAL EISENHOWER CHAUFFEUR HAD MARRIED ONE OF OUR WRENS AND THEY WERE VERY FRIENDLY BEFORE I WENT AND HE LET THEM HAVE HIS HOUSE IN EM NEAR FRANKFORT ERM FOR THEIR HONEYMOON AND THEY WERE BOTH DUE BACK IN BERLIN AND THEY WOULD GIVE ME A LIFT SO I WENT BREEZING UP THE ATIVAN FROM FRANKFURT TO BERLIN IN GENERAL IS AND HOW CAR AMAZING WHAT WAS BURNING LIKE WHAT WAS THE POST FOR BURNING ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED YEAH THAT REALLY DID SHAKE ME WHEN I SAW IT YOU KNOW THERE WAS ALMOST EVERY BUILDING WE SAW WAS UM DESTROYED AND THERE WERE THESE AND THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY OLD WOMEN BUT THEY LOOKED OLD BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL HUNCHED UP YOU KNOW IN DARK CLOTHES WITH WHEELBARROWS CLEARING THE STREETS WORKING SO HARD AND LITTLE FOOD YOU KNOW THEY WERE WORKING WITH VERY LITTLE STRENGTH BUT UM I MUST GIVE THE GERMANS THEIR THEY DID WORK HARD TO GET BERLIN BACK DID YOU GO TO THE BRAND BORN GAY OR THE SUPPOSE YES ABOUT SOMETHING WELL THAT AGAIN WAS MORE LIKE A TOURIST TRIP YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN TRYING TO THINK WHAT OUR OFFICE IN BERLIN WAS LIKE AND BY THEN OF COURSE IT WAS THE CONTROL COMMISSION AND UM I CAN'T VISUALIZE IT AT ALL IT'S AN ABSOLUTE BLANK IN MY MEMORY I CAN REMEMBER THE WRENERY THE JAPANESE EMBASSY AND I CAN REMEMBER GOING ON THE TRAM FROM THERE TO THE OFFICE BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OFFICE AT ALL AND BECAUSE I WAS THERE FOR NEARLY A YEAR THAT YOU KNOW WE WENT TO UM SEE THE BUNKER YOU KNOW WHERE HITLER WAS KILLED AND THAT WAS STILL IN IN YOU KNOW A PRETTY ROUGH STATE YOU KNOW BITS OF FURNITURE WAS STILL THERE IT HADN'T BEEN TIDIED UP WHAT WAS YOUR SENTIMENT TOWARDS THE GERMANS AT THE TIME WELL IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE ERM I FOUND THEM VERY HELPFUL BUT THEN AND YOU KNOW I QUITE LIKE THEM BUT OF COURSE THEY HAD A LOT TO GAIN FROM US IN THE WAY OF FOOD AND SO ON THE RUSSIANS OF COURSE WERE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE STORY GOES THAT THE THE MAIN RUSSIAN ARMY THAT TOOK BERLIN THEY PULLED THEM BACK AND THEY REPLACED THEM WITH THE SORT OF THIRD LINE WHO WERE MONGOLIANS AND THEY WERE PRETTY ROUGH AND ERM ON ONE OCCASION COMING HOME FROM THE OFFICE A COUPLE VERY THEY USED TO DRINK AN AWFUL LOT ANY BOOS THEY GET HOWEVER A COUPLE OF VERY DRUNK RUSSIANS STARTED WE WERE WALKING HOME FROM THE OFFICE IN BERLIN AND YOU ARE AND THEY STARTED GETTING THEIR GUNS OUT SHOOTING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND WE HAD TO JUMP IN A HEDGE AND AFTER THAT TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY AND AFTER THAT ERM THEY PUT A FAIRLY STRONG MARINE

YEAH YOU KNOW YOU SAW STARLING AND CHURCHILL IN THE YOU KNOW JUST AS THOUGH YOU WERE A TOURIST AT YOU TALKED A BIT EARLIER ABOUT HOW THE NAVY KNEW MORE ABOUT THE GERMAN NAVY THAN THE RUSSIANS THE RUSSIANS WANTED THE CARRIERS THE WANTED THE DESTROYED WAS THERE YOU KNOW JUST TO RECAP ON THAT WAS THERE ANY MORE OF THAT DISCUSSION SORT OF PRE POTSDAM THAT YOU CAN RECALL OR WAS IT A SORT OF DONE

MAN SOCIALIST HE WAS AT THIS FOREIGN SECRETARY AND HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE GOT ERM CROSS OVER SOMETHING AT POTSDAM AND BANG THE TABLE AND WATER YOU KNOW THERE WERE GLASSES OF WATER WHICH ERM I GATHER THAT THE RUSSIANS DIDN'T TAKE VERY KIND TO THIS MAN YOU KNOW WHO WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE HIS WAY AND BANG THE TABLE AND THE WORK UP UNTIL WE GOT TO BERLIN WAS REALLY QUITE INTERESTING BUT ONCE YOU KNOW THE FINAL STAMPS WERE BEING PUT ON THE DIVIDING OF THE CITY INTO REGIONS AND THINGS LIKE THE BREAKUP OF THE OF THE GERMAN NAVY THERE REALLY WASN'T MUCH INTERESTING TO DO AND IT DID BECOME A SORT OF ALMOST A PLAYGROUND JUST TELL ME ABOUT VJ DAY YEAH WELL WE WERE IN BERLIN WHEN VJ DAY WAS ANNOUNCED THEY SAID THERE WOULD BE A PARADE TOWARDS THE BRANDENBURG GATE SO WE WENT HAD THE DAY OFF AND WENT DOWN TO SEA AND IT WAS A WONDERFUL DISPLAY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE END OF THE WAR AND EVERYBODY WAS A BIT TIRED AND FED UP THE AMERICANS PUT ON A GREAT SHOW WITH WHAT EQUIPMENT THEY HAD AND SO DID THE RUSSIANS WERE YOU THRILLED THAT IT WAS THE END OF THE WAR WHERE WERE YOU THRILLED WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER THERE YES I SUPPOSE WE WERE REALLY WE WERE ALL A BIT UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN YOU KNOW THE WAR WAS OVER YOU KNOW THERE WAS THIS DEVASTATED CITY HOW WAS IT GOING TO RECOVER YOU KNOW WHO WAS GOING TO SEE THE GERMANS BEHAVE THEMSELVES YOU KNOW WITH LITTLE RECOGNITION THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE REALLY THE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE BECAUSE THAT WAS IN STARLINGS DAY OF COURSE ERM YES IT WAS IT WAS LIKE GOING ANY GROUP JUST GOING OUT TO SEE A PARADE YOU KNOW AND THAT WAS WHEN WAS YOU DEMOBBAND JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT THAT OH I DID GO BACK TO CHATHAM TO BE MOBBED UM YOU KNOW I SAID I WANTED TO BE DEMOBBED AND OF COURSE THEY WERE THEN PLANNING THE BREAK UP OF ALL THE SERVICES UM AND ER I WENT BACK TO CHATHAM JUST TO BE HAND OVER THINGS THAT EQUIPMENT I'D GOT THAT I HAD TO RETURN IT WAS VERY UNEVENTFUL THING MIGHT GO AND I RETURNED HOME WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND YOUR BEM ER WELL THAT AGAIN WAS A BIT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO EXPLAIN BECAUSE IT WAS MAINLY FOR THE WORK THAT I DID YOU KNOW THE THING THAT CAME YOU KNOW FROM THE PALACE JUST SAID FOR ZEAL AND DEVOTION TO DUTY WHATEVER THAT MEANS YEAH BUT OF COURSE IT WAS WARTIME AND THERE WAS NO SORT OF GOING TO THE PALACE TO GET YOU GO OR ANYTHING YOU KNOW IT JUST CAME IN THE POST NICE BUT BUT IT WAS QUITE NICE TO FEEL THAT IT WAS RECOGNISED BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T MADLY INTERESTING OR MADLY RESPONSIBLE UM YOU FELT YOU WERE CONTRIBUTING AN INSULT WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED TO DO IN THE BEGINNING THIS GREAT THING OF SERVE YOUR KING AND COUNTRY DOING YOUR BIT YEAH YEAH AND HOW HOW DO YOU REFLECT ON YOUR LIFE AS A WREN THEN I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW I BEGAN TO BECOME MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN BEING WITH PEOPLE RATHER THAN PAPER AS IT WERE AND I HAD A I WAS LOOKING AROUND FOR A JOB AND I FOUND THAT THERE WAS AN APPROVED SCHOOL ERM WANTING A SECRETARY AND THEY CALLED THEM HOUSE MISTRESS IN BATH ERM I DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN BRISTOL I DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK TO MY OLD JOB AND THAT'S HOW THAT WAS MY FIRST STEP INTO SOCIAL WORK AND THEN MY FATHER BECAME VERY ILL AND AS THE UNMARRIED DAUGHTER IN THE FAMILY I WAS EXPECTED TO BE AT HOME ERM AND YOU KNOW I WAS CONCERNED FOR BOTH OF THEM BECAUSE HE WAS A GOOD DEAL OLDER THAN MUM SO I RETURNED I GAVE UP THE APPROVED SCHOOL THAT I WAS WORKING WHICH INCIDENTALLY THE LAST ONE WAS A PLACE CALLED DUNCROFT IN MIDDLE SIX WHICH HAD BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH JIMMY SAVILE I THOUGHT I'D GIVE THEM AND THEN OH I HAD BEFORE I LEFT UNCROFT I HAD GOT MYSELF A JOB WITH BRISTOL RM CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT WHICH WAS IN THE DAYS BEFORE THE SOCIAL SERVICES AS SUCH WERE FORMED AND I STAYED WITH THEM UNTIL I RETIRED BUSH COLLEGE YOU KNOW THAT WAS TWENTY NINE YEARS AGO AND DO YOU STILL THINK ABOUT THE WRENS OH YES THE WRENS HAS REMAINED CONSTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A VERY STRONG ASSOCIATION AND THAT'S I GATHER HOW YOU RAN ME TO EARTH AND I'VE BELONGED TO THE LOCAL BRANCH SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY THREE I THINK IT WAS I JOINED SO YOU AREN'T STILL AS PROUD TO BE A WREN NOW AS YOU WERE WHEN YOU BECAME ONE YEAH YEAH YEAH THAT'S
