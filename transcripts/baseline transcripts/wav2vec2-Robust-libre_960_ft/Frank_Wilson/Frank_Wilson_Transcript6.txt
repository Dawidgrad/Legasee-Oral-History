finished up in salon before we get there a did you get ashore in russia yet what did you get ashore in russia oh yes won't remember the russians well the the people you see it's hard to say that but you didn't look like sailors he'll put it that way because you want you was wearing such heavy every clothing you ain't got naval uniform on anything like you know you got your big great coat on and everything they could have been anybody and and and the germans without clothes to a man they didn't know who we were and they got a bit shy of it at first and if we used to do what we could with them we'd we'd take of the spare grub to em and you know because they were starving no doubt about it but he could none of them could speak english and mostly women anyway because mean even women working on dog side there i mean that most men have gone to war huntley but it's now it's sad to describe really what they were like you can understand have been scared on us because we could have been anybody how did you feel it time you remember the fear of death and suffered oh i don't think that ended yet really no fear of dying or anything but i mean her i don't think that was on your mind at all you know there's no i say i can't remember really can't remember feeling scared or anything did dick did captain willoughby ever slow down and pick out you now re rescue for anything we couldn't we we couldn't know we went at a we went all out to anyway because we were sitting target all the time for the german aircraft me they knew what because we got fighters on who could send fighters off straight away after german aircraft and shoot them down cause they we did get rid of quite a field along with tracker so you know an aircraft carrier never stopped i couldn't that tabin escort of about four i think we are about four and a flower class caves at our escorts we had to cut you dirt you didn't mean we won't to death stopping you got that edwin it but where did the activity set in the convoy it varied it varied usually in the middle he was set in the middle case i mean it they were so precious the aircraft carriers in them days that they had to be guarded because with these are in fighters on and and we also be a sword fish which are out there was armed with either tops or death charges whichever so they were a big menace to the germans i see in the obvious men we had quite a few coming out that an agora with a bullet once but so do i i think it might have been from american i never know what happened that day well usual well they used to come over didn't the plains probably two or three times a day you never know and bobbing custer only in no way it was very close so i mean we had to have a good cover and the carriers the escort carriers doing a marvelous job because they they got the fighters to fight off and take off and you know and chase him but you got here but you got a bullet i did we had this at happened that day i don't know i don't even know where it comes from be another rage you see on it was getting rained every day all the way there and all the way back they were just as eager to sink the ships coming back empty as they were fallen so there were no let up so after the arctic did you then go on to atlantic duties always had the same sort of time well we was doing atlantic before arctic convoys they were all mixed up and then we did some mediterranean ones and i had a list of it somewhere we i should imagine we covered about twenty different convoys altogether but we worked with one called a tracker we worked together case in tracker was a camera ship not ours so whatever peace were taken were taken on there how we went we did to mediterranean as well went out at mad they know what you were doing down there escorting convoys and dropped him off at malton so we then we went straight on to alexandria and then down and we didn't know where we were going at the time i finished up going down the canal to salon we didn't know we thought we were going back to yoke back to gerald it wasn't the case you never knew you never knew where you were going from one day to night was willoughby still with you when you went through the canal yes how we lost him just after i can't remember exactly when it were but really what happened older he knows more about that frank than we cause him he knew a quarter master he you know and i got rid him and this captain north or somebody come on an entirely different fellow we are we going from freezing cold at north going out the far east and we got no tropical year when we got into in columbo they they got a set fitted out with a tropical year in a shorts and tropical shirts et cetera benito to them we'd only got us you know as a winter clothing funny thing about all this about this conway we used we used to sail out to grenache and the people in greenock would tell you where you were going how did they get to know and to make to think them do but they did and when you got to the far east do you remember rescuing the the s s peter sylvester that was quite a while after yeh yeh it was the first of all i thought i think first of all we thought it was a japanese boat or whatever i didn't know what it was and then the the apter spotted said it would it was a ship full of these sailors yeh american i remember what happened when we brought him on board year the they'd gone down to nothing they'd lost a bat for well they were twenty days in that boat or no and we took him to a free mantle a and we went round to sydney and cat came back to middle east and we got paid off
