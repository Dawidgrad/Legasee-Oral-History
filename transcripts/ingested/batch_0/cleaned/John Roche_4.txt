you talked about action stations you talked about the red white and blue watch system what entertainment was there on board hms renown later on in the war we had a sixteen mil projector and they could show films around on various parts of the ship and then later on we had an aircraft hanger because we carried two aircrafts on board and when the aircrafts were taken off the ship i think in about nineteen forty one that was converted into a cinema and then that became thirty five mil i think the only other entertainment would be the loudspeaker in the mastic and whatever that was connected to sometimes we would hear the news our ears were always glued to the news waiting for winston churchill to speak or there would be very serious business going on such as ships being sunk or bomber raids we'd all listen intently to the nine o clock news every night we had no newspapers of course now and again if somebody was going away for a long period of time schoolmasters would produce a weekly newspaper with the news that had come over and put it in paper form for us to read the entertainment we played tombola of course that was always a naval game tombola call the numbers out and that would happen three times a week after a while when everyone got organised there were some good singers on board so they had a ships concert party going and so we made our own entertainment you could be playing chess draughts or cards and so we made our own the ship had been completely gutted out and so all that was left was a massive hole so they rebuilt and put new guns and armour and new engines and everything else it was a very fast ship renown could do over thirty two thirty three knots so we often left the destroyers behind in bad weather because they couldn't keep up with us so we did a lot of time on our own zigzagging of course trying to dodge any u boats around what do you remember about heading up to scapa the first time can you remember that once the war had been declared and you were off to join the fleet yes it was all a bit of a shock on the first day then you suddenly got used to being at war and getting it drilled into you everyday and then we got up on the scapa flow and the next thing was german bombers came over and we suddenly realised people were dropping bombs on top of us so we had to open fire we shot a couple of them down but they hit a couple ships and they missed us we didn't get hit then of course we moved from scapa flow into loch fyne on one of those places we were lucky really because we moved out before the u boat came in and sank the royal oak the royal oak was sunk in scapa flow in october nineteen thirty nine the german u boats would have sunk a few more ships of we would have been in there i think nobody expected that they thought we were in a safe anchorage because you know they had barricades around and nets and things like that but they hadn't reckoned the fella coming in at high tide and he slipped in over the barricades and got into the flow and got out again and sunk a ship on his way did you hear about the royal oak being sunk how did that affect the crew well we just felt it could have been us i suppose every ship that was sunk in the war you heard about it and i guess that put you more on your metal really they said keep a good look out and watch what you're doing and to make sure when you're at your action stations make sure you shoot down aircrafts sink the submarines it sharpened you up a bit really when we heard the hood had been sunk it was one of our sister ships there was the hood the repulse and the renown was the three battle cruisers and when the hood sunk there were only three survivors out of over fourteen hundred men on board men and boys of course so if a ship blew up like that there wasn't much hope for anybody so i suppose we just accepted it we were in it and that's it really
