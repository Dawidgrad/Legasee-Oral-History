I SERVED FROM NINETEEN FORTY ONE TO NINETEEN FORTY FIVE M BASICALLY EM WESTERN APPROACHES THAT INCLUDES PLYMOUTH RIGHT THE WAY UP RIGHT THE WAY UP TO SCOTLAND TOP OF SCOTLAND AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME JOAN FIELD I WAS JOAN ROSE ON WHERE ARE YOU FROM AND WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO YOU WELL I ACTUALLY WAS BORN IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE IN A LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED MILDRIS I THINK IT WAS A FIFTEENTH CENTURY THATCHED COTTAGE WHICH WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S SMALL HOLDING I WAS BORN THERE UM MY PARENTS WORKED ON THE SMALL HOLDING EM IN NINETEEN THIRTY THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR WE MOVED TO THE NEW TOWN OF WELLING GARDEN CITY WHERE MY FATHER THEN GOT EMPLOYMENT AND I LIVED THERE AND WENT TO SCHOOL THERE UM I WON A SCHOLARSHIP IN A BURSARY TO ERM SHERWOOD HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS IN WELLING GARDEN CITY AND I MATRICULATED AT WHICH WAS THEN CALLED A MATRICULATION I WAS THEN SEVENTEEN I WANTED TO JOIN THEM THE WAR HAD BROKEN OUT BY THEN OBVIOUSLY I WANTED TO JOIN THE WRENS I WENT DOWN AND THOUGHT WELL HOPEFULLY GETTING THE WRENS IF NOT I'LL HAVE TO GO INTO THE WAFT BUT THEY ACCEPTED ME INTO THE WRENS AT THE TIME THEY WERE ONLY TAKING ON COOKS AND STEWARDS WHICH OF COURSE I DID NOT WANT TO DO I HAD AN EYE TEST THEY DECIDED I GOT PERFECT EYESIGHT THEN AND SO I WAS TOLD I WAS GOING TO BE A SIGNAL I DIDN'T MEAN MUCH TO ME BUT I DIDN'T MIND WHAT IT WAS AND I WAS CALLED UP JUST A MONTH BEFORE CHRISTMAS TO HMSCABELA WHICH IS UP IN WARRINGTON WHAT YEAR WAS THAT 'S JUST TRYING TO THINK NINETEEN I THINK IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE IN BEGINNING IN THE MIDDLE OF NINETEEN FORTY ONE AND I THOUGHT THIS IS MARVELLOUS ALL THE OFFICERS AT CHRISTMAS WERE WAITING ON SO I THOUGHT THIS WAS A LOVELY IDEA THIS IS BECAUSE I WAS SHORT LIVED IT WAS VERY TOUGH AT KABA EM YOU WERE GIVEN TWO WEEKS FOR WHAT THEY CALL PROBATION AND YOU WERE GIVEN ALL THE DIRTY JOBS TO DO ALL SCRUBBING THE FLOORS CLEANING THE LOOS IT WAS MAKE OR BREAK TIME REALLY SQUALL NET SQUADRIL OH HATED SQUARE BUT I GOT TO LOVE IT ACTUALLY AFTER THAT BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY EM AT THE END OF THE FORTNIGHT UM WE WERE ACCEPTED SOME OF THEM WENT HOME SOME OF THEM WENT A WALL IF YOU WENT AWOL THEN YOU JUST WENT INTO MUNITIONS OR WHATEVER BUT IF YOU DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT PERHAPS THE WA WOULD HAVE HAD YOU WE WERE FIRST CHOICE IN THOSE DAYS EVERYBODY WANTED TO GO IN THE WRENS AND SO I STARTED MY VISUAL SIGNALLING AND CODING I DID SOME CODING AS WELL BUT BASICALLY VISUAL SIGNALLING AND THE COURSE LASTED I THINK FOR SIX MONTHS YES HE WAS AT ABOUT SIX MONTHS FOUR MONTHS NO FOUR MONTHS FOUR MONTHS I THINK AND AT THAT TIME AFTER THAT TIME YOU WENT ON LEAVE YOU WERE THEN DRAFTED TO DIFFERENT PLACES WE ALL PUT DOWN FOR PLYMOUTH ALL WANTED TO COME SOUTH BECAUSE I DID LIVE THEN WHEN IN GOTHAM CITY OBVIOUSLY SO IT WAS SOUTH I WANT IT I ENDED UP IN OBAN I NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT I HAD TO FIND IT ON THE MAP WHEN I GOT THE DRAFT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE IT WAS FOUND IT AND I THOUGHT THIS IS LOVELY THAT WILL BE LOVELY UP THERE CAN I JUST JUST GOING BACK A LITTLE BIT YOU SIGN UP YOU WERE EMPHATIC THAT YOU WANTED TO JOIN THE WRENS OR ANY OTHER SERVICE WHY I DON'T KNOW UM I GOT NO NAVAL OR MY MY FATHER AND MY GRANDFATHER ALL SERVED IN THE ARMY ERM I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS I LOVE TO SEE ERM MAYBE THE UNIFORM IT'S A BIG I DO I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE IN THE WRENS IT WAS JUST SOMETHING I THINK STEPNEY HAD THE SAME WHEN YOU READ HER BOOK IS AN ATTRACTION TO IT I SUPPOSE IN A WAY IT'S A SORT OF A GLAMOUR OF THE WRENS NOW YOU MENTIONED CABLE AND YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW SHIP VISUALIZATION AND CODING BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE LEARNING AND HOW YOU LEARNT VISUALIZATION AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THE PROCESS WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU GOT TO LEARN THE MORSE CODE UM YOU KNOW EVEN AT SEVENTEEN THAT'S A BIT TRICKY BUT STILL YOU LEARNED THE MORSE CODE UM AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY DRUMMED INTO YOU THE MORSE CODE IS IT PURELY REPETITION YES REALLY AND TRULY AND YOU LEARNED GIMMICK TO LEARN IT YOU KNOW LOOK OF F DID YOU KNOW FACE YOU KNOW YOU WERE DOING ALL THESE SORT OF GIMMICKY THINGS TO REMIND YOU UM IS TOUGH WE WERE ALL PUT INTO CLASSES AND THE VISUAL SIGNALS CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH A V AND MY CLASS WAS VERITY AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT DEFINES CLASSES WHICH IS JUST MENTIONED IN THE BOOK THE WIRELESS TELEGRAPHERS CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH W LIKE WAR SPITE AND THE CODING CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH A C I MEAN AND EACH COURSE WAS A DIFFERENT LENGTH AND WE LEARNED MORSE CODE SEMAPHORE IT WAS A SIGNAL WITH FLAGS YOU KNOW LIKE THE OLD NELSON SIGNAL WHICH KEPT CHANGING LEARNING THE FANETIC ALPHABET WHICH HALFWAY THROUGH OUR COURSE CHANGED SO THAT THE AMERICANS COULD UNDERSTAND IT WHICH ANNOYED US WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO CHANGE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS ANYWAY SO THE PHONETIC ALPHABET UM EVERY CLASS WAS MANNED BY AN X SERVING MAN USUALLY A CHIEF WHO'D NEVER DEALT WITH WOMEN BEFORE AND SOME OF THEM WERE A BIT TOUGH A BIT TOUGH BUT WE NEEDED IT BECAUSE WE WERE COMPLETELY RAW TO IT ALL WE HAD OH WE WERE TAUGHT NAVAL DISCIPLINE AND DIFFERENT TIME WATCHES YOU KNOW HOW TO TWENTY FOUR HOUR CLOCK WHICH OF COURSE WE HADN'T STARTED TO USE THEN THE BASICS REALLY BASICS AND I FOUND IT QUITE ENJOYABLE IT WAS JUST LIKE BEING AT SCHOOL REALLY AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR WRENERY WHERE WERE YOU STAYING WARM PRETTY SPARTAN BUT NOT TOO BAD IT WAS UM OLD NISSEN HUTS I THINK THEY'D BEEN USED BY THE ERM I THINK MENTION DEFINE MENTIONS IT IN HER BOOK I THINK THEY'D BEEN USED BY THE POST OFFICE THEY WERE ALL OLD NISSEN HUTS ON THIS BIG BIG SITE AT NEWTON FIELD JUST OUTSIDE WARRINGTON AND IT OBVIOUSLY NOW BEING DEVELOPED INTO A BIG HOUSING SITE BUT IT WAS A VERY LARGE CAMP ERM MOSTLY THE WRENERY BUT THERE WERE ALSO THE MEN ON BOARD AS WELL THEY WERE LEARNING UM I THINK THEY WERE DOING WT BUT WE WERE OBVIOUSLY BEING TRAINED TO TAKE OVER SOME OF THE SIGNAL STATIONS FROM THE MEN TO RELEASE THEM WHICH WE LEARNT RAFTERWARDS OBVIOUSLY SO I GOT MY DRAFT UP TO OPEN AND WHEN YOU GET A DRAFT ERM WHAT YOU KNOW HOW WAS YOUR COMMUNICATION WITH YOUR PARENTS AND THIS DRAFT YOU SAY ON MIND ME WHERE'S THAT HOW DID YOU GET THERE WHAT DID YOUR PARENTS THINK WELL A BIT STAGGERED MY MY MOTHER MY FATHER YES MY FATHER TOOK ME UP TO EUSTON STATION ERM MY GOT THIS DRAFT JUST A THING REPORT TO THE M I SUPPOSE IT WAS SO WE WERE PATROL POLICE UP IN EUSTON THEN I WAS SENT ON TO UM WHEN I GO FROM KING CORN I SENT WENT TO KING'S CROSS AND I HAD TO GO TO EUSTON ERM MORE OR LESS MILITARY STUFF WE ALL IN CIV ONLY ALLOWED TO TAKE A SUITCASE OF CLOTHES ONE ONE OUTFIT OF CIVIC CLOTHES AND THEN YOU KNOW THE USUAL UM PAJAMAS ALWAYS PAJAMAS ERM SLIPPER YOU KNOW THE USUAL SORT OF THING YOU SEE WE WERE GOING INTO HOSPITAL SO BUT ONLY ONE SET OF CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND TO REPORT TO THIS PLACE IN ONE OF THE STATIONS I THINK IT WAS KING'S CROSS AND THEY TOOK ME UNDER THEIR WING AND SORTED ME OUT AND GOT ME ONTO THE TRAIN MY FATHER SAW ME OFF AND THAT WAS REALLY ALL THAT HAPPENED I ENDED UP I THOUGHT WHEREVER AM I GOING YOU KNOW YOU'RE ON MARS AND MARS BECAUSE ALL THE ERM THERE WERE QUITE A FEW SAILORS ON GOING UP TO DIFFERENT GOING BACK ON LEAVE AND THEY WERE ALL KIND TO ME THEY ALL REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THE TRAIN WAS CROWDED AND I CAN REMEMBER WE COULDN'T SIT DOWN ANYWHERE AND ONE OF THE SAILORS PUT ME UP ONTO THE TOP OF THE THE RACK AT THE TOP SO I COULD HAVE A SLEEP I CAN ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT UM WE GOT TO ERM CARLISLE THERE WAS AN AIR RAID WARNING AND WE HAD TO STAY IN CARLISLE SIDING FOR ABOUT AN HOUR WHICH MEANT I HAD MISSED MY TRAIN FROM CARLISLE TO UM STERLING WHERE I HAD TO CHANGE AGAIN SO THAT WAS ANOTHER PROBLEM GOT TO STERLING AND OF COURSE THE TRAIN TO OBAN HAD GONE SO I WAS STRANDED UM THE VS PUT ME UP IN A HOTEL HOSTEL FOR THE NIGHT AND THEN I WENT DOWN TO OBAN REPORTED TO OBAN TO THE UM OFFICER IN CHARGE OBAN AND WAS TOLD I WAS GOING TO ERM PER SIGNAL STATION IN THE MORNING I GO GOING TO THE PER SIGNAL STATION IN THE MEANTIME OF COURSE I'D BEEN KITTED UP A CABLE WE WERE KITTED UP BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BELL BOTTOMS NO IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR A VS WREN BECAUSE IT'S SO COLD SO I WAS ISSUED WITH BELL BOTTOMS AND THE NEXT DAY WENT ON DUTY YOU KNOW AND I THOUGHT THIS IS CRAZY ALL THE SORT OF BUSINESS CABLE ALL THIS STRICT DISCIPLINE NAVAL DISCIPLINE NOBODY SEEMED TO BE BOTHERED NO I DON'T THINK YOU THINK THAT THEY REALIZED THERE WAS A WAR ON EXCEPT OF COURSE THE CONVOY WAS COMING IN M I LIKED I LIKED IT I LIKE SCOTLAND STEPNEY DIDN'T LIKE IT IF YOU'LL READ IN HER BOOK IF YOU EVER READ IT UM SHE JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO MIX IN VERY WELL WITH SCOTTISH PEOPLE BUT I HAD GOT A SCOTTISH GRANDFATHER PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT I SO I DID SORT OF ACCEPT IT MORE AND I REALISED THAT YOU KNOW THEY ARE A BIT INSULA AND THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO BE OFF FOOTING BUT THEY WERE BECAUSE THEY IT IS AN INSULAR LAND UP IN THE HIGHLANDS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THE HIGHLANDS VERY WELL THEY ARE A THING TO THEMSELVES OK WELL SO JUST DO ME A FAVOR THEN JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE BASE WAS LIKE WHAT YOUR SURROUNDINGS LIKE WHERE YOU SLEPT AND IT IS OPEN IT OPEN AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE WORK WELL I OPENED FIRST OF ALL I WAS STATIONED IN WHAT WAS CALLED THE STATION HOTEL AND THE SIGNAL STATION ON THE PIER WAS ONLY A SHORT WALK AWAY AND I MET UP WITH A GIRL WHO WAS GOING TO WORK WITH ME SHE'D BEEN THERE ABOUT A WEEK WE HADN'T YET STARTED REALLY GETTING THE CONVOYS IN SO WE WERE TOLD WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THAT UM THE CONVOYS WOULD COME IN AND THEY'D BE IN A BAY AND WE HAD TO AND THE MAN THE MAN IT ALL THE TIME AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO ON ANY BOATS AND THAT'S ANOTHER STORY WE HAD TO MONITOR EVERYTHING COMING IN AND OUT WE ALSO HAD TO LOOK AFTER FUNNILY ENOUGH THE RAF HAD THE SUNDERLANDS AND CATALINAS UP THERE AND THEY HAD A CALL SIGN WHICH CHANGED EVERY HOUR AND HALF OF THEM COULD NEVER EVER READ IT SO WE USED TO HAVE TO READ THEIR SIGNAL FOR THEM TO SEND THEIR PATROL BOAT OUT BUT THAT WAS UNKNOWN TO BASE WHO NEVER HAD A CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON IT WAS A CRAZY SET UP REALLY AND SUBMARINES ON PATROL DUTY USED TO COME IN ALONGSIDE THE PIER AND WE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THEM THEIR SIGNALS THEY WERE THEN WENT OUT ON PATROL THAT WAS MOSTLY WHAT WE WERE DOING AT THE PIER SIGNAL STATION BUT THIS WASN'T ADEQUATE ENOUGH AND GANOVAN SIGNAL STATION WHICH WAS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER FROM WHERE WE WERE WAS STILL MANNED BY THE MEN AND THEY ALSO HAD A NEW ASDIC CENTER OPENING UP JUST BELOW WHICH WAS RADAR AND ASDIC WAS STILL DONE BY THE MEN AND THE MEN WERE GOING FROM GANOVAN AND THEY WERE GOING OVER TO LISMORE THE WRENS WEREN'T ALLOWED OUT THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS IT WAS COMPLETELY ALONE OUT THERE WAS NO NO THERE WAS NO INHABITATION SAY A FEW FOR A FEW SHEEP FARMERS SO THE WRENS WEREN'T ALLOWED OUT IN LISMORE AND THAT'S WHERE THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN KNOWN TO ANYBODY EM SO THE GANAVAN SIGNAL STATION WAS GOING TO OPEN UP AND WE WERE GOING TO GO THERE WHICH MEANT VERY GREAT DIFFICULTY BECAUSE FROM THE STATION HOTEL TO GANOVAN IT WAS ABOUT A COUPLE OF THREE MILES TWO OR THREE MILES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT'S NO JOKE SO EVENTUALLY I WAS THERE FOR A SIGNAL STATION FOR ABOUT I WOULD SAY ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE GANOVAN WAS OPENED GANOVAN SIGNAL STATION WAS THEN OPENED UP FOR THE WRENS AND WE TOOK OVER FROM THE WREN WE HAD AN INTAKE THEN OF MORE VS WRENS SO THEY WERE NOW SIX OF US INSTEAD OF FOUR AND WE TOOK OVER GANOVAN FROM THE MEN VERY VERY SPARTAN WHEN WE WERE AT THE PIER SIGNAL STATION WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE MEALS IN THE MESS PROPER MEALS WHEN WE WERE ON NIGHT WATCH IT WOULD DO US NICE SANDWICHES WHEN WE MOVED FROM PER SIGNAL STATION TO THE GANOVAN SIGNAL STATION WE WERE STATIONED AT A PLACE CALLED RACE LODGE WHICH WAS VERY TOUGH GOING ERM THEY DIDN'T LIKE WATCH KEEPERS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T HANDLE US NEARLY ALL NEARLY ALL OF THE WRENERY WAS WRITERS OR WT OPERATORS WHO WORKED PROPER WATCH HOURS THEY WORKED NINE TILL FIVE NOT AS WE HAD YOU KNOW WE HAD TO DO WATCH KEEPING HOURS SAME AS THE NAVY SO IF YOU WERE LUCKY YOU GET A HOT DINNER IF YOU DIDN'T YOU JUST HAD A SARDINE SANDWICH SO THE FOOD WAS PRETTY SPARSE IF YOU READ IN THE BOOK PEOPLE MY FRIENDS WHO READ THE BOOK SAY WHY DID YOU STAND IT BUT I SAID BUT THERE WAS A WAR AND WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY DIFFERENT WE HAD TO GO TO IT WAS OUR JOB THE MEN IT WAS IT WAS A VERY VERY SPARSE SIGNAL STATION ERM SURE YOU WANT ME TO DESCRIBE IT TO YOU SO YES THE SIGNAL STATION ITSELF WAS RIGHT ON THE TOP OF GANAVAN ON JUST BY ONLY HOUSE WHICH IS THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND LADY OF DOODLE I THINK THEY WERE CALLED YES MC DOODLE AND IT WAS ON THEIR LAND AND IT HAD BEEN BUILT AS A LOOKOUT POST I THINK ORIGINALLY FOR THE COAST GUARDS IT WAS A VERY SPARSE IT WAS TO TWO TIER PLACE YOU HAD TO REACH IT BUT TO GET TO IT IT WAS A CLIMB UP A CLIFF ALMOST A SHEER CLIFF THE ROAD WENT BELOW US AND THE SHEER CLIFF UP WHICH WE HAD TO CARRY THE OLDEST LAMP BATTERIES WHICH WAS VERY HEAVY AND THEN WE HAD TO HAVE A COAL FIRE A BECAUSE WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO BURN ANY CONFIDENTIAL BOOKS WHICH WE HAD IF ANYTHING IF WE HAD ANY KIND OF AN INVASION WE HAD TO PUT THE BOOKS GOODNESS KNOWS HOW BECAUSE THEY WERE LEAD LINE THEY WERE SAFE FROM BUT WE THAT'S WHY WE HAD THE FIRE WE HAD A BUNK DOWN BELOW AND A SIGNAL UP AT THE TOP AND A BALCONY ALL ROUND WE HAD A BIG TEN INCH THREE AUDIS LAMPS AN ART ART SET AND IT WAS REALLY JUST GO YOU KNOW THAT WAS IT WE JUST PUSHED INTO THE DEEP END AND HOW FAR COULD YOU SEE FROM THERE WHAT WAS YOUR SO WE COULD SEE LITERALLY WHERE SHE GOT IT WE COULD SEE RIGHT FROM WE COULD SEE MULL RIGHT THE WAY DOWN TO MULL OVER TO LISMORE WELL WE HAD A PERFECT VISION OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS COMING AND GOING WHY WAS THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT STRETCH OF COASTLINE IN TERMS OF THE CONVOYS IN BECAUSE IT WAS VERY SAFE ERM THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD COME IN IT WAS IF YOU COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE MAP M THERE 'S A COMPLETE BAY AND TOBERMORREY THE ESCORT SHIPS USUALLY EAT TWO OR THREE DESTROYERS WOULD DROP THE CONVOY OFF AND GO UP TO TOBERMORRY EM THEY WOULD GO UP UP THE SOUND OF MULL M IF YOU COULD VISUALIZE THAT COASTLINE MULL ALMOST PROTECTS THE BAY SO ANY SHIPS PASSING HAVE TO GO ROUND BEHIND THE MULL THEY DON'T REALIZE YOU KNOW COMING IN THAT'S ANOTHER STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK ERM I THINK IT WAS A VERY SAFE HAVEN THEY CAME IN AND ERM THEY WERE ESCORTED OFF FROM US PROBABLY DOWN TO GOUROCK IN GO INTO THE CLYDE FOR UNLOADING OR THEY WOULD MASS UP READY TO GO OUT IT WAS EITHER AN ETA OF ARRIVAL OR AN EXPECTED TIME OF DISPATCH THEY WERE EITHER COMING OR GOING AND WHAT WAS THE MOST SHIPS YOU THINK YOU EVER SAW THEM I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE HARBOUR WOULD BE FULL I WOULD SAY THIRTY MORE THAN THAT YES THIRTY MOST LIKELY AND OF COURSE YOU'D HAD YOU HAVE A LIST AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW YOU THINK THEY MIGHT BE A STRAGGLER BUT THEY WEREN'T THEY NEVER CAME YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THAT WAS A TERRIBLE THING YOU WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ONE WE HAD QUITE A LOT OF LOSSES UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN THE NOT IN THE BAY BUT YOU KNOW COMING AND GOING YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE YES BECAUSE WE HAVE WE HAVE A LIST SENT TO US WHICH WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL LIST EXPECTED TIME OF ARRIVAL AND YOU'D GIVE THEM ABOUT TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT THEY NEVER CAME YOU KNOW YOU JUST WONDER WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WERE ALL MANNED BY ERM MOSTLY MERCHANT MERCHANT MEN SO THEIR MORSE WASN'T VERY GOOD BUT NOW AND AGAIN YOU'D GET A SHIP WHICH HAD A FEW TERM UNITED STATES WHEN AMERICA CAME IN IT WAS BETTER PLANNED YOU KNOW THE LIBERTY SHIPS CAME THEN AND THEY WERE BETTER MANNED THEY WERE ERM A LITTLE BIT OVERPOWERING REALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO SHALL I SAY THIS OVER CLEVER THEY USED TO SEND MORE AT THE RATE OF KNOTS THINKING THAT WE COULDN'T ANSWER IT WE WOULD SEND BACK AT THE SAME RATE UM THIS IS WHY WE DIDN'T LIKE THE AMERICANS VERY MUCH I'M AFRAID THEY TRIED ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY TRIED TO COME UP TO OUR SIGNAL STATION AND WE COULDN'T HAVE THEM IN WERE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM IN WE HAD ONE OR TWO PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE COMING UP EM ONE SHALL I GO ON YEAH ONE NIGHT UM I COULD HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE THING AND A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW THIS VOICE I DIDN'T KNOW WHO IT WAS IT WAS A MAN'S VOICE WE ALREADY HAD A WREN MURDERED IN FERRARI OR A VS WREN MURDERED IN FERRARI ON NIGHT WATCH SO WE WERE ALL VERY WARM WHICH WE ALL WERE TAUGHT HOW TO HANDLE A PISTOL WE HAD TO GO ON THE RANGE WHICH WAS THE RAF HAD A RANGE AND WE WERE TAKEN ONTO THE RANGE BY AN INSTRUCTOR AND TAUGHT TO FIRE PISTOL AND I HAD VERY SMALL RISK AND I WAS TAUGHT TO FIRE HOLDING MY WRIST SO I COULD FIRE IN MY WRIST WE ALSO HAD A RIFLE UP IN THE SIGNAL STATION IT WASN'T LOADED THERE WAS NO AMMUNITION IN IT BUT THE PISTOLS WEREN'T THAT BUT THIS RIFLE WASN'T LOADED IT WAS JUST THERE AS A WARNING I HEARD HIS FOOTSTEPS THIS IS PERFECTLY TRUE I HEARD HIS FOOTSTEPS COMING UP AND I SAID TO MY POT I DON'T LIKE THIS VERY MUCH SO THIS KEPT KNOCKING ON THE DOOR IN THE END I GOT THIS RIFLE AND I THOUGHT NO I CAN'T I KNEW IT WAS UNLOADED AND I THOUGHT WHAT AM I GOING TO DO SO I PUT IT UP THE OTHER WAY AND AS THIS VOICE CAME THROUGH THE THING I LIFTED IT UP AND WAS GOING TO CLOG HIM ON THE HEAD WITH IT HE SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT JON IT'S ONLY ME AND IT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNALMAN FROM DOWN BELOW STUPID WHO'D GOT A DATE I HAD CHANGED WATCHES WITH A GIRL I SHOULDN'T HAD TO TELL HER THIS REALLY HE OBVIOUSLY USED TO COME UP FOR A CUP OF TEA AT THIS TIME AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH HER AND HE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON WATCH AND HE NEARLY GOT HIMSELF KILLED AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE IN MY RIGHTS BECAUSE WE NOBODY HAD GOT A GREAT BIG PROHIBITED NOSE AND UP ON THE DOOR BUT YOU KNOW I NEVER EVER CAME TO ANYTHING AND I NEVER EVER REPORTED IT BECAUSE I GOT HIM INTO TERRIBLE TROUBLE BUT WE WERE ARMED BUT ONLY WITH A PISTOL AND HAD A RIFLE WITH NO AMMUNITION BECAUSE WE HAD IN INVERARI WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T KNOW I'M AFRAID ALL THAT IS I NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WE WERE JUST TOLD TO BE VERY AWARE AND TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS AND I THINK STEPNEY MENTIONS THIS IN HER BOOK AS WELL WE NEVER EVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED AND WE HAD WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A SPY A MAN USED TO COME DOWN IT WAS ALL PROHIBITED LAND FOR CIVILIANS BUT THIS MAN USED TO COME DOWN SIT ON THE ROCKS AND WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS AND HE HAD NO AND A CAMERA WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CONVOYS WE COULD TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AROUND THE CABIN AROUND THE THING BUT NOT A CONVOY NOT ALLOWED TO AND SO WE REPORTED THIS MAN TO OUR HEADQUARTERS BACK IN SIGNAL BACK IN THE STATION HOTEL NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ABOUT IT HE JUST DISAPPEARED NO WE NEVER EVER HEARD WHETHER IT WAS JUST A LOCAL NEWSPAPER MAN OR WHETHER HE WAS A KIND OF A SPY OR WHETHER HE WAS JUST INTERESTED IN SHIPS WE NEVER HEARD I'M AFRAID IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS ALL NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD AND JUST YOU KNOW JUST PICKING UP ON THE AMERICANS YOU YOU WERE SORT OF TALKING ABOUT A STORY BECAUSE THE AMERICANS GAVE YOU SOME HASSE ERM YES WELL THEY WOULD TRY TO BRIBE US THEY WANTED TO COME UP THE SIGNAL STATION LOOK AT NOW LOOK HONEY WE'VE GOT SOME NYLONS OR HONEY WE'VE GOT IS ON BOARD YOU KNOW I MEAN SO STUPID AND SO CHILDISH WE TOOK A DISLIKE TO THEM WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE WAS THE WAY THEY USED TO TREAT THEIR OFFICERS COMPLETE DISRESPECT THEY WOULD CALL THEM BY THEIR FIRST NAMES WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS TERRIBLE AND THE CAPTAINS ALL THE OTHER OFFICERS NEVER SEEMED TO TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THEM WE WERE IN OBAN ONE DAY SHOPPING AND THE AMERICANS CAME ON BOARD CAME ON PRIVACY SHOPPING AS WELL AND EM WE WERE GLAD TO TAKE US FOR A CUP OF COFFEE OK FINE WHICH THEY DID WE TOOK THEM TO THE YMCA WE HAD A CUP OF COFFEE GOING BACK SOME OF THEIR OFFICERS WERE COMING THE OTHER WAY WELL WE WERE APPALLED THE WAY THEY SPOKE NO SALUTING HI HI CAP I THOUGHT THIS IS TERRIBLE I MEAN I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT THEY WERE JUST ANOTHER WORLD AWAY AND THEY WERE TRYING TO BRIBE US WITH BANANAS AND ONIONS AND WE JUST DIDN'T YOU KNOW DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW WE THOUGHT IT WAS TOO CHILDISH BUT ALL THIS VERY FAST FLASHING MORSE YOU TOUCHED ON THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF EM YOU KNOW COMMUNICATION YOU HAD THE SEMAPHORE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LAMPS THERE YEAH ALL THE LAMP SO JUST WHEN DID YOU USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNICATION NOW IS ONE SPECIFIC TYPE IN NOVA IN THE STATION ALWAYS BY MORE BY LIGHT OR SOMETIMES BY RT NEARLY ALWAYS THE ART REALLY ONLY USED FOR THE ASIC STATION AND MOSTLY THE OLDEST AND ALL THE BIG TEN INCH WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT OF COURSE TO HANDLE YOU HAD TO GO OUT ON THE AND OF COURSE UP THERE THE WINDS WERE ALWAYS AT GALE FORCE AND WE ALWAYS HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOR THE WEATHER EVERY DAY WE HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOR THE CONVOYS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER WAS WHAT WERE THE CONES THE CONES WERE THE CONE WAS A SHAPE LIKE THAT YOU HOISTED IT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH WAY NOW UPWARDS FOR UPWARDS FOR THE NORTH WIND AND DOWNWARDS FOR THE SOUTH WIND VERY PRIMITIVE BUT IT GAVE THEM SOME IDEA OF THE THE WIND I MEAN ANOTHER THING MEAN YOU COULD TELL THE WAY THE WIND WAS BLOWING JUST LOOK AT THE ENSIGN WHICH WE ALWAYS HAD TO FLY THE WHITE ENSIGN AND WE HAD TO BY THE COLOURS OF THE WHITE ENSIGN PUT IT UP AT SUNRISE AND DOWN AT SUNSET SO THE ENSIGN WAS ALWAYS FLYING SO YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHICH WAY THE WIND WAS BLOWING WITHOUT THE CONE BUT IT WAS A GALE FORCE WIND USED TO PUT THE CONE UP WHICH SOMETIMES MEANT THE CONE WAS UP FOR DAYS BECAUSE THE GALES WOULD BLOW UP THERE VERY VERY WINDY AND SOMETIMES WE WOULD HAVE TO BE LASHED ONTO THE TEN INCH BY OUR OPERA BECAUSE IT WAS SO WINDY YOU KEPT BEING BLOWN AWAY IT WAS VERY VERY COLD AND VERY WERE ALWAYS WET BUT WE DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER DID YOU HAVE TO DO BATH OR A SHOWER UP THERE WHEN WE WENT BACK TO THEM HOW LONG WOULD YOU BE SITUATED UP THERE WELL THE NIGHT WATCH WAS A LONG ONE WE'D GO ON SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT O'CLOCK AND COME OFF AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING THAT WAS A VERY LONG ONE THE OTHER WATCHES WERE PRETTY WELL FOUR HOURS ON AND FOUR HOURS OFF BUT THE NIGHT WATCH AS IT WAS A TOUGH ONE BUT YOU HAD TO WALK THERE AND THAT FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO WALK WE COULDN'T BE OBJECTED BECAUSE THE MAN IN MEN IN THE STICK STATION DOWN BELOW US GOT TRANSPORT THEY WERE WORKING THE SAME WATCHES OH WELL YES OK THEN THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD ISSUE US WITH BICYCLES WHICH THEY DID WE HAD A WREN OFFICER CAME UP TO SEE US AND HE SAID THIS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND THEN THEY SUPPLIED TRANSPORT FOR US SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK THE NIGHT WATCH BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS THREE OR FOUR MILES IN THE PITCH DARK ALONG ALL THE COAST ROAD BUT FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO BEFORE THEY REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING THAT'S AMAZING A STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK YES THAT THE DUKE OF YORK WELL WE NEVER HAD THE VERY BIG SHIPS THE BIGGEST SHIP ESCORT SHIP THAT EVER REALLY CAME INTO US WERE DESTROYERS OR OR KORETZ UM BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS USED TO GO INTO MAL TO WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS TO GO BACK OUT SO WE NEVER REALLY HAD ANYTHING WHAT I WOULD CALL A VERY LARGE I WAS ON WATCH WITH STEPNEY EM ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION AND IF YOU CAN PICTURE THE ISLANDS AND THE SEA AND SUDDENLY YOU SEE A GREAT BIG CROSS ANCHOR A CROSS MASK COMING AT YOU AND THINK WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE WE HAD NO ETA FOR ANYTHING WE HAD NOTHING WHAT EVERYTHING WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY YOU KNOW IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT OF COURSE WE CALLED IT UP NO REPLY OF COURSE THAT WAS WORRYING NO REPLY BECAUSE IT WAS A SPECIAL EVERY EVERY HOUR IT CHANGED THE CALL UP SIGN CHANGED IN THE CODE BOOK SO YOU WOULD CALL THEM UP BY THE CODE WHICH IT WAS FOR THE DAY NO REPLY SO WE HAD A LITTLE SHIP WE HAD TWO SHIPS ACTUALLY ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN STAR AND ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN WAVE AND THEY WERE PATROL SHIPS WHICH USED TO PATROL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AMONG THE CONVOYS ALL THE TIME THEY WERE OLD WHAT I WOULD CALL SOMETHING LIKE A CORVETTE UM I THINK THEY WERE OLD TRAWLERS THEY WERE MANNED BY ERM NAVY AND THEY WERE IF ANY TROUBLE WE CALLED THEM UP IMMEDIATELY AND THEN WE CALLED UP THE SOUTHERN STAR SHE WAS A WAY OUT OVER A MALE AND ASKED HER WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHE SAID I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING FROM HERE BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE IN A WAY BUT SHE SAID I'LL GO AND INVESTIGATE SHE SAID IF IT'S ANYTHING IN TROUBLE I'LL PUT A SHOT ACROSS ITS BOWLS THAT WAS THAT ANYWAY THIS THING GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER EVENTUALLY I MANAGED TO CALL OUT OBVIOUSLY THE BUNTING TOSSER THAT'S WHAT VISUAL SIGNALS ARE CALLED BUNTING TOSSES WAS ASLEEP I SHOULD THINK HE THOUGHT OH WE'RE ONLY CRUISING AROUND THESE ISLANDS AND HE CAME BACK QUICKLY WITH D OF Y INSTEAD OF A PENNANT NUMBER BECAUSE ALL SHIPS HAVE PENNANT NUMBERS EITHER THE PENDANT NUMBER OF THE SHIP OR THE CODE HE CAME BACK WITH NOTHING QUICKLY OF WHY AND I SAID TO STEPHANIE D OF DUKE OF YORK SAID GOSH IT'S A BATTLESHIP I SAID BASE DON'T KNOW SO WE QUICKLY PHONED OUR BASE AND THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE US BECAUSE NOBODY HAD GOT ON ETA ANYWAY THE CAPTAIN OF THE OUR CAPTAIN BASE CAME RUSHING DOWN TOOK HIM ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO GET TO US BY WHICH TIME SHE WAS IN FULL VIEW MASSIVE GRAVE IT JUST FILLED UP THE WHOLE OF THE BAY I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT AND OF COURSE IT WAS A GREAT BIG HOO HA ABOUT THIS WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW OF COURSE SHE WAS ON SHE WAS ON PILGRIMAGE UP TO NORWAY AFTER THE ERMASHARNHORST AND SHE WAS DOING THIS TO I SUPPOSE SHE THOUGHT OH WE'VE GOT TIME TO DOING I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DID IT THEY WERE WAY OFF COURSE I MEAN NOTHING WOULD EVER SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN WAS A VERY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS OUT THERE BUT SHE DID SHE CAME RIGHT PAST US SAILING JUST OFF MULL I MEAN I COULD SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE SHE WAS IT WAS ON THE MAP SHE JUST APPEARED BEHIND THE ISLAND AS IF IT WAS ON SOME KIND OF A FILM IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND IT WAS SORT OF THING YOU HAVE TO DREAM ABOUT LOVELY STORY LOVELY STORY NOBODY EVER REALLY AGAIN A NEED TO KNOW WE NEVER EVER REALLY FOUND OUT WE REALISED AFTERWARDS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT IF YOU WERE ON HER WAY UP TO THE BATTLE IN NORWAY DRINK OF TEA PLEASE R D DAY OH YES HE D DAY CAME WE HAD ALL THE SHIPS WE HAD WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT WHY THEY LOOKED SO DREADFUL THEY WERE ALL SORTS OF BATTERED SHIPS WE THOUGHT WELL SEEN SOME AWFUL SIGHTS BUT THEY WERE ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY OF THEM I SHOULD THINK WITH TWO DESTROYERS DURBAN AND SOMETHING ELSE ONE WAS THE DURBAN SOMETHING MAYBE I'VE WRITTEN MAYBE SHE MENTIONED THEM IN A BOOK ANYWAY AND WE THOUGHT GOD I DESTROY IT WAS A TERRIBLE STATE SURELY THE NAVY KNOW THEY WERE IN WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE THEY CAME IN I SUPPOSE THEY WERE IN ABOUT A WEEK OR MORE THAN TEN DAYS ENOUGH TIME FOR DEFNE TO GET TO KNOW THIS SIGNAL AND AND THEY SAID IT MUST BE TEN DAYS WE STILL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WEREN'T SUCH AND WHY THEY DIDN'T BECAUSE THEY ONLY EVER STAYED TWO OR THREE DAYS BUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A LONG TIME AND WE THOUGHT HELLO SOMETHING SOMETHING'S GOING ON THEN ALL OUR WE WERE TOLD WERE NOT ALLOWED TO POST ANY MORE LETTERS ALL THEIR LETTERS WERE TO BE CANCELLED ALL THEIR POSTAGE OUT WAS TO BE CANCELLED EVERYTHING GOING OUT FROM THE BASE WAS TO BE STOPPED AND WE ALL LEAVE WAS STOPPED AND WE THOUGHT SOMETHING'S IN THE AIR YOU KNOW YOU GET THAT FEELING WE THOUGHT WHERE ARE THEY GOING WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO OF COURSE THEY WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS UM ON THE NIGHT BEFORE D DAY THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT OR SO THEY SAID UM THE NIGHT BEFORE WE ALL SEEMED TO BE GETTING READY THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG SHIP CAME ALONGSIDE SOME OF THEM AND TOOK OFF A LOT OF STUFF WE THOUGHT THEY DON'T USUALLY UNLOAD HERE IT GOES TO GO AND GRANOCK BUT THEY WERE UNLOADING ALL SORTS OF STUFF AND WE WATCHED THEM THROUGH THE TELESCOPE YOU KNOW CHAIRS AND TABLES AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS WERE COMING UP WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS NOW NO NEXT DAY WHEN WE CAME UP ON WATCH THEY WERE ALL BUSY GETTING READY TO GO OUT AND WE HAD NO EXPECTED TIME OF DEPARTURE AT ALL THEY ALL JUST SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR OUR TWO PATROL SHIPS HAD NO IDEA THEY SAID WHAT DO WE DO WHAT THEY'RE GOING WHERE WE HAD WE COULDN'T TELL THEM OF COURSE IT WAS SO SECRET AND THAT'S THE END OF THE DAY THAT WAS ALL THE BLOCK SHIPS GOING DOWN THEY WERE ALL ROTTEN OLD SHIPS THAT NOBODY WANTED THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD BEEN SO BATTLE SCARRED THAT THEY WERE ALMOST UNSINKABLE SO THEY WERE THE TWO BIG BLOCK SHIPS AND THESE WERE SENT ON TO HELP OUT AND WE NEVER EVER HEARD UNTIL THE END OF THE WAR WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT THESE OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS YOU TOUCHED ON EARLIER BUT I'D LIKE MORE CLARIFICATION ON IS THE CONVOYS ESSENTIALLY YOU DID TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTATION CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN AGAIN FOR ME YOU KNOW HOW THE PROCESS A DISPATCH RIDER WOULD ARRIVE FROM BASE FOR THE STATION HOTEL WHICH IS THEIR BASE A STATCHRIDER WOULD ARRIVE WITH A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH WOULD CONTAIN ETA OF THE NEXT CONVOY COMING IN AND RIGHT SO YOU'D THEN GET IT OUT PUT IT IN FRONT OF YOU PUT IT UP AND WAIT FOR THE FIRST ONE LITERALLY TO COME IN ETA NINE HUNDRED PERHAPS WOULD START COME IN TO NINE THREE HUNDRED THEY'D OBVIOUSLY BEEN MARKED I SUPPOSE I THINK FROM IRELAND THEY WERE THEN SORT OF MARKED ACROSS WOULD GET THE ETA OF THEM COMING ACROSS THAT WAS LITERALLY HOW WE GOT THE ETA FROM A DISPATCH RIDER A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WOULD COME I SUPPOSE THEY BUT EVERY THE CONVOYS WERE COMING IN QUITE REGULARLY AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH COMING IN BY THE TIME THEY'D GONE OUT AGAIN THE BAY WAS ALWAYS REALLY YOU ALWAYS CHOCKABLOCK THEN OF COURSE YOU GO THEY ALSO GOT THE RAF BOATS GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH THEIR SUNDERLAND AND THE ERM CATALINA SO IT WAS QUITE A BUSY LITTLE HARBOUR AND EVERY SINGLE THING HAD TO BE LOGGED AND LOGGED OUT IDENTIFIED AND PUT DOWN YOU KNOW SO YOU HAD TO BE ON WATCH PRETTY WELL AWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON ALL AROUND YOU LITERALLY IN THE AIR OVER THE CATALINA THIS IS WHY WE HAD TO HAVE SOUTHERN WAVE AND SOUTHERN STAR WHO USED TO BE OUT THEY WERE ALSO SIGNALLING AND TRYING TO GET THEM IT WAS REALLY LIKE A GREAT BIG HERD OF SHEEP AND TWO SHEPHERDS TRYING TO GET THEM IN IT IT COULD HAVE BEEN ORGANISED CHAOS BUT IT WASN'T IT WAS VERY VERY GOOD IT ALWAYS WORKED IT WAS JUST REALLY SHEPHERDING THESE SHIPS YOU KNOW THESE BIG LIBERTY SHIPS THEY WERE QUITE BIG DID EACH LIBERTY SHIP HAVE ITS OWN SORT OF CALL SIGN THAT YOU WOULD EACH YES EACH WE KNEW WE KNEW EACH ONE WE HAD AN IDENTIFICATION FOR EACH ONE SO WE COULD MARK THEM OFF IF NOT WE GOT THE EVERYONE'S NAME SOME OF THEM WERE VERY LONG BUT YES WE HAD AN IDENTIFICATION FOR ALL OF THEM YOU HAD TO CONCENTRATE QUITE HARD WHEN THEY WERE COMING IN YOU COULDN'T LET YOUR ATTENTION WANDER BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO BE SO QUICK YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THEM NOT COMING IN HOW DID YOU HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU KNOW YOU DONE FIVE CONVOYS IN YOUR MISSING TWENTY BOATS WELL WHAT WAS THE FEELING WELL FIRST OF ALL WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED YOU WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE I HOPE THEY'RE ALL RIGHT AGAIN BUT THE TIME YOU'VE DONE IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR OR SO YOU JUST ACCEPT IT WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED AGAIN YOU GOT THIS NEED TO KNOW WE USED TO TRY AND FIND OUT WE WERE NEVER EVER TOLD THE THREE OF THEM PROBABLY BEEN SUNK OFF SOMEWHERE AND YOU SEE I WONDER HOW FAR THEY GOT AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MEN YOU KNOW BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THAT LOVELY STUFF THAT WAS COMING IN OR GOING OUT I DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW YOU JUST DIDN'T KNOW YOU JUST NEVER KNEW YOU JUST HAD TO ACCEPT
