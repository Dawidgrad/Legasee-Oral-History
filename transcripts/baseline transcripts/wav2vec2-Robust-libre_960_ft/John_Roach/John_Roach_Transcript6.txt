what do you want to remember of iceland it was a dreary sort of a place we were in up in a place called wafer ford if to field i think it was cold we now and again the boys get may get a trip down to rekevik which was the capital but anybody went down there on a day trip or some they said it was very expensive down there but we were just in a big anchorage and we built our own football pitch ashour we we made a football pitch and he and when that would be our main thing or our fishing over the side you could fish all all day and all night really am and and then we were there once and there was a mighty gale blew up and all the ship started to drag in their anchors the wind was about a hundred and twenty mile an hour i think you know a lot of ships dragged anchors and a couple of em went to ground so ever every ship had two anchors down and they were steaming half speed ahead to and enter the wind just to hold your position age could see that you know what i was a big storm that came up and how did they how did the inner handle a big sea she was a good sea sea boat really you know she dug her bows down you know and then she shook a shake herself now and again and he she do a bit of a corkscrew but she was a good she was a heavy ship mind she was thirty two thousand tons something about by but then i think and a but she looked but she rolled you know she rolled like any other ship would in in in a big ocean like that and did you have good sea legs oh yes yes yes i was never sea sick really because well i grown up as a boy i done i was to go out in a boat fishing and things like that so i'd been used to being in a boat and i'd been used to being at sea so i wasn't really worried it didn't worry me but a lot of people were sick all their life really even lord man button he he was always sick even to the end of his career now that a so so some people never got over it but some people after after a couple of weeks you know giving them plenty of work to do and make sure they were kept in and kept busy they they they you you know most most lads forget about but got over sea sickness stories or recollections of of the arctic convoys that you won't share with me no not really i suppose we were glad to get even get back to scapa flow to get away from him escape flow is a dreary old place but you hope they maybe get down to ross it and do a small refit or some and i have a run run ashore up to edinburgh but yes it was it was just dreary i suppose if you like you know it a dreary old job that had to be done okay but after after the outset i think he probably went down to the man we did yes and we we done we done about twelve months there is escort and no convoys to malta we've done a lot of that we were down there with the ark raw and the sheffield we were known as force hah and we done a lot of escorting convoys to malta tell me about some of those convoys they they were various types of conversant they'd normally try to get the bigger faster sort of chips you know that you could nip through there and we could if we were going on on a convoy into the mediterranean we'd probably leave gibraltar in the night time just it was getting dark or something and head out into the atlantic because the there were so many spanish people watching where we were going and transmitting it over to over to berlin i suppose you know every movement of every ship which was what was logged back to back to germany so we'd go out and tear the into the atlantic and the and then about midnight and when it was dark and we'd turn around and go full speed through the straits of gibraltar so when dawn came up we we were well into the med and away from gibraltar or hopefully we'd thrown them off the scent but i don't know where it was always successful or not after a couple of days to see an italian aircraft nosing around they would see where we were anyway but i suppose you played a bit of cat and mouse if you could and you talk talk a bit about these italian bombers that were coming how is it just italians that you get up or german as we mostly at that end of the mad it was italian bombers that they were come and come over yet they yet they dropped a few bombs fairly close to us and cause they were submarines around there as well we had a couple of near squeaks from submarines that they were german new boats and italian submarines there so it was but again it is you try to outwit them by zigzagging and keeping up a steady speed and and some of those convoys i said they're a pretty big ship they were faster type of ships they were hopefully they could get through them all to you know by dodging the u boats with their speeds from the fourteen fifteen knots and then we'd escort them just near near enough to molt and maybe then the destroyers and that would bring carry them on the rest and we turn round and come back again you know but we we were making sure that the italian fleet didn't get come out and attack the convoy that would be our prime job really and we were in action with the italian fleet there at one time derive a it's was so well we we we we got no then we got information that the italian fleet was at sea and we had admiral summerville on board he was the admiral you know is a great guy everybody liked him and and he had we had the ark royal with us and the sheffield and and a couple i think the royal sovereign had the battleship and something else and we chased after these i italian ships because so we got into action with them and you know we opened fire on them but the italian ships were fastened on australian they nipped away and we chased them within about thirty miles of the italian coast but of course admiral somerville decided then that his prime job was to look after the convoy really and you know to get back with it with the coburn safeguard the convoy and apparently he got into trouble with the with the admiralty and winston churchill for not really chasing the italians you know right into their into their harbours which had been a dangerous game really because we could be an open to bmers and all sorts of things and and we could have been sunk and and the convoy could could have been venerable really but i think he was hauled over the coals about it but then it was rescinded afterwards and and they agreed that he'd done the right thing but which everybody was very pleased to be coe was a very popular admiral i take it you were then in your action station specify well i i do know by that time i'd been on the ship a couple of years and i'd had various acts in stays and i'd been in the transmitting station i'd been on one of the four five guns and i'd been lookout position but by that time i'd become a torpedo man i was by then i was a leading seaman and i became a leading torpedo operator and we was to look after the the electrical side of the ship so i had different duties by then you know my duties and i became a semi electrician if you like you know looking after normal lighting or or ships fire control and things like that so so that that that e that's what my career became afterwards became being a torpedo man in such a way you file of the fifteen pounders that used to break all the bows oh very very very very often the did the the fifteen inch oh yes is not on the lights should fly off the bulkhead or something like that at all it all depends on which bearing it was on it was on the beam it was fair enough but sometimes they do you know it was firing ahead or or firing in you know that the the gun was trained near your own upper works he know that when when the gun fired the blast would affect the nearest part of a ship to it a much in fact they used to have these overhead fans in the admiral squatron if we knew we were going to fire the fifteen is gun we'd have to nip in take the fans down because they could be blown off the off the deck head in the other the the the normal big big bladed fans going around
