you have any big swell down down we did have some swell year i mean jones got it going further down to the south atlantic here after going past the african coast and all this lot here it's got it was getting really stormy lower down like her lower down the south and out but we did competitions as well when we doing tug o war and everything else and us medics beat the guards at tug a war ha ha ha which i was chuffed up haye so i kept us opie we were doing running sport and all that sort of one of all types the thing was i took a photograph of the whole of us on this ship on the crew and that but we've not no one never has ever received a photograph at all from that so i don if there's one around anywhere somewhere when when did you were cause it's been set them them ship them board ships have been scrapped now the e the nordic and the baltic cause i know someone in the merchant merchant marine was well ex merchant navy he was in the medical courses at season with me and he's telling me is to eat in the merchant navy association and he gets to know about all this information and whether when did you first set sight of the four plans down way and were you still on that ship or had you how did it how did you transfer across the awe that's a bit that's a that's a big story though we were supposed to join the rest of our unit on the cure too and the merchant the merchant seamen on the nordic parse arranged a pipe for us in their mess and that made this they must have put all sorts in this punch the mad and everything else and we had some beer down there they had a party down there for us and we peer we we we give them one of our stable belts or what we wear round our trousers which is red blue and yellow or colors and it was signed by all of us on that ship not you at all the alemedics on the ship signed this belt and it went down to their mess and not a term it must em i'm trying to think now i sailed about me they must be about me the eighth or ninth i think it was we sailed down and it took us about three weeks to get down there and we got into falkland sound and with the alley other ships and am then then then one night me into me and some of the medics not all of us i think i went with with our sergeant a couple of others we were picked up by a landing craft a tank and were taken through all these inlets i couldn't tell you where they were cause it was pitch black but they took us to all these inlets and whatever and it ended bringing us to san carlos san carlos bar where the rest of our unit had come so that must have been a yes that must have been the round about the beginning of june that happened because not long after we we got on landing craft utility the small landing craft which took us to the the sir galahad the the night before we got hit and we joined that arm that did you that must ve been on that must be in the er that must have been either june the seventh or june the eighth when you were down there and you got down there did you feel there was you now you were at a far greater risk was there a difference in the way everybody was behaving here there was a different reaction because parsley there was the argent china plans flying about dropping bombs and bercy fighter firing firing their guns and that so yes we know we're a beastly in a war then that's that when the reality mall is kicked in for everyone as ports really that as these plans for firing at us where was that rise you now be when i was that would have been when we got into falkland mollis when we got malice in falkland sound enough arm but we heard more of them when when i was mollis on the intrepid not when we got when the gallard was hit and we were flown on the intrepid because we we got all the er it was like a running commentary on the intercom coming up but these aircraft and all this like and could see them screeching by and everything else and and another thing that scared us when i was on the intrepid and a lot of others was we heard these explosions at the side of us during her in at night and i asked my uncle about this he said all that's a them throwing grenades over the sides because if has any any frog man tried to sabotage the shape up so these grenades were set fired off every so often when you when you came off of the what was the name of the the piano ship a the nordic very so when you came off the nordic and you got on to these l c t been just describe what what that was what happened and what was it like when it was very dark as i take our equipment off there wasn't many of us on on this l c t and it was we were just going through the inlets of we're from the enemy and whatever so so we weren't detected and he took us to san carlos bar where we met the rest of our sort of unit had you been with the free lemons had you been brief what you were doing the other tolls were met on our unit or not but we weren't sure well we won't show about the galahad because really we should have gone by our own means corset costas called was a troop ship which the welsh guards had commandeered to get round because and what happened was that the jetty had been blown apart blown up so at the time we couldn't disembark in weather am so so with the l c t we knew what was happening that wit where we were caught that where we were going off to you see to meet the rest of our unit on that in the middle of the night early hours of the morning or not and then you got the else you and was quite cold cause it's open we bury out in the open and out you now on these el c ts was it good to me the rest of the unit he was you yeah got to meet some of them are enough and it so that was that was quite good that was a no and get to meet a lad who i didn't well i met i met one of the lads who i didn't expect to see down there he was sparse left in all share originally and i saw the last time i saw him was on the galahad and he got he got killed on the gala cause we lost three medics on the galahad and and so when you you got hooked up in your the people at san carlos and anyone else see you and then you're going out to the garden you we've yeah we're getting fed and watered base or do in general and admin to ourselves clean toseland polishing boots and things like that here just there keeping out looking after equipment there cleaning your weapon and that just doing things keep your mind occupied really
