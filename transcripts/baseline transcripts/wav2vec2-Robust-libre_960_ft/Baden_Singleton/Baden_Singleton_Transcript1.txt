my name is baden abel singleton i was born september twenty seventh nineteen twenty four and i was brought up in the purbeck area in dorset i went to los school until i was fourteen two and a half mile track to school and when i was fourteen because my father died when i was seven i had to get out and get some work as we were brought up on a parish from ten am and i got this job in domestic service in puddle town there's three male servants and three each a kitchen and housemates is quite a happy house really i was there until i joined the navy and i was glad to get out of there because i was on my own i was doing the butler inside of it and it just me you know anyway i joined the r n at seventeen and a half to go as standing guards on the camps i did my training at gosport new barracks gosport at six weeks disciplinary and rough outline of naval then i went to have stocks camp six months i was there standing guard and then from there to general service traded at some collingwood were you a volunteer for the navy was this something you were really wanted to do oh yes yes right right from a youngster i found i found a a she man's hat on warburg bay beach and it fascinated me i was i tried i had tried as a boy to get into the navy and i couldn't i'd got two retracted ribs not even the merchant navy would take me but course when the war came they didn't notice that a except anyone i shot anyway from from goshport to collingwood and i really can't remember emily we did the full train in there quite straight we had an old retired p o train in charge of our class and he didn't want to come back in and he let us know at every opportunity he was he was quite a character is said if it wasn't for you lot i could be at home sitting in my armchair and spitting on the ceiling that was his favor you see and during the training in collingwood roads weren't that wide and your marching in a squad and a squad coming from the other direction he would tell you you now as you what would would you do if we were so to move over but not him straight through he said march over em you know we had that sort of trick it was all new to us and of trade in a it was just a batch draft two for from collingwood to lowestoft a batch of us so you had no choice now now now now we we we just say man we don't have choices that what happened when you got to lowestoft a s am we weren't happy it was a wet day a miserable night we got there dark and because they have no barracks and you were billeted in the town was much too late for us to be billeted so the main area was a concert hall that was part of this am placing most of where it went took over it was a big concert hall with the stage and what have we anyway we just spent the night on this floor how you could now us lay down you went sleep we were tired enough and then in the morn and we went round with a lorry and you would drop half you drop off there i've finished up a south end of lost of pak field quite a long way from a base but then we had free bus transports all say you were in digs basically you were you were billeted on an tiger an irish irish billeted with some a fishing skipper and he was very strict but a nice old chap you know and what one real feeling i had with that he would insist on making yorkshire pudding in a basin and we had to eat it you could not leave it unless you had a pocket which very often happened you know you must not leave his yorkshire pudding but he was a great chap meeting down the pub and buy him a drink and he was your mate all through the word service of a shaman and a shaman and on honor on a mine sweeper and you depend how many watch as the first ship i was on a we only had six seamen so that meant we did four hours on and four hours off all the time you were at sea which could be quite a long time and quite tiring and of course you watch is change at the dog watch which is six till eight yes six to light i to think that am and you know if if you were close to the dogs just come off and wanted to sleep you lost it because you stood to dawn and dusk you always know everyone was up you see and we had an hour and twenty minutes on each post this was some on the bridge look out hour and twenty minutes at the wheel and an hour and twenty minutes on the after gun look out the after gun look out made to coke for the next watch i shook when when we're in harbour you chipping paint painting getting stores and you know all no sort of manual jobs i suppose and the sea scrubbing the deck it's it's she that's all you did you win a sweeper takes in a lot of water she she's don't like a big liner and you couldn't do much on the deck if if she's a bit choppy there's not much you could do actually so you're just watch keeping or sleeping you didn't do anything between on on the second ship the walburwe had a nine sheep men showed that we had a three hours off and eight of three on a four four hours on and eight hours off except with the dogs and they knew lost a bit my first trip out was on the romeo and at the time we set off i was pumping water from the main tank to the hedge up top and i'm pumping away you see and the ship poked her head outside down a trough up a trot down and i o over the side and that was it no more i thought i lost what i had then and i went back to pump in the water quite happy the only time i was ever sick again was off benghazi we were at anchor and the heat was terrible no air at all and there was a heavy swell and this general you know and i was sick again just just once once i got rid of it i was all right but that's the only time the ships i was on was escort when we were mastic swaps and a radar so you were detecting mines not mind you no submarines detecting submarines or mind if there was any band yes we find them now we see subs we were we up for and if you has got a contact then what did you do nobody was handed to the bigger escorts but if you know in some circumstance we had to drop our own a thing is well dust death charge but you don't mind me because we only do twelve knots so that you now race we couldn't race about but whereas the um are or am i in the need was it was a frigate and take over a bit faster in covets than he did i mean even the other there was another one on a south african whaler was part of our escort general off and i can i can never remember the names of the ships or how many but we had feared such other
