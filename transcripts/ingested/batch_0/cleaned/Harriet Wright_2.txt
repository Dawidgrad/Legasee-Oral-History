so you decided to do your bit what do you remember of that enrolment process um well i had to go to see time um edinburgh capital glasgow dundee was the third city aberdeen fourth when the oil came around of course aberdeen is third city now but at that time i had to go to dundee for my medical now the strange thing about that was when i got out of the station i'd never been to hall before and yet i know i knew where i was going i knew exactly what room i was going to head for and i could never understand that that was the most strange but obviously i was then to go in the wrns had to go there for my medical and i um passed it obviously and then got the call up and did my training at balloch loch lomond which was rather nice except that before that we go there before the wrns took over the americans had been there and they left lock stock and barrel leaving dirty things here there and everywhere you know and when we got there they were building new loos but until they were finished we had these open loos you know i didn't like that at all in fact there were five of us that um we got off after lunch every day and five of us used to head down to balloch station to have a you know a comfortable because it was awful to sit and then somebody else coming in and then of course what they had to do was to empty those um daily but that didn't last for long because the others the flush loos were ready within a few days but until then we head down to balloch to get on these loos you know how did you you know you mentioned that you were a country girl but how did you find that sort of i imagine a very relaxed comfortable you know okay tough but care free existence to military life how did you find that change um i don't know i'll tell you this while um this contingent was there the wrns could within the two weeks training if they didn't like it they could leave i don't think this applied to the waf or the ats but there were two girls um i mean you were put to scrubbing floors and things like that it's all part and parcel of your training and these two girls they just wouldn't do it you see um off they went they weren't going to and yet one of the permanent staff there a leading wren had said to them it's not like this when you finish your training it's only here you'll be doing this you won't be doing that elsewhere you know but they didn't listen so um i don't know i just scrubbed floors and did as i was told more or less and um i think if you set your mind to do something and you want to do it you have to get over the initial training or whatever was it military stuff it sounds like it wasn't particularly military based it was well it you've talk about of course you had the tallest on the right shortest on the left i always knew where i had to go because i'm so short left but again you didn't do much of that afterwards you only did that you know while you were there but i was very glad i wasn't the shortest about the third shortest while i was there so i was happy because when they do the um right wheel and left wheel etcetera i'd be going the wrong way i'm sure but um i enjoyed it we had um a test i don't know if everybody did but i certainly had um this test was to do with say um arithmetic and various things um in case your wanted to be supplies or whatever but as i got um the whole of the paper right they didn't know what to do with me so that's why i ended up as a messenger to start with but having said that we then went down to from there we went down to earls court and gardens which was a holding depot before you posted onto somewhere else you see now we were all scots there near nearly all of us were scots come sunday we had to go on divisions you know what divisions are you know um so we marched to the church and as we got to the door of course the normal squad halt catholics fall out so in we went and it was very very high church they were swinging the incense and chanting and we had such a simple service you see in scotland where i was not so much glasgow would have been different but the east of scotland um different very simple and come the next sunday um those that of us that were still there said um 'shall we ask if we can fall out like the catholics so will you be spokeswoman ' so we all went there but i was spokeswoman and i said well we know we've got to go on divisions etcetera but really can we fall out and go to a church of our own you know scotland something because it was far too high for us we didn't know when to bob up and down you know that kind of thing and we were told by the regulating petty officer on duty you're here for such a short time that you more or less do as you're told and now i didn't like that that's the only thing that i had a quibble about because i don't think that should have been happening and what can you do about it we didn't want to be on commanders defaulters so we did as we were told then the following week of course most of us had gone after that but you were there usually about two weeks maybe three and then off to plymouth and plymouth was again a holding depot but we were in houses in mannamead and one of the wrens houses had been bombed just two doors up from where we were because they did have it quite badly bombing in the in plymouth and um we were there for about another two weeks but we didn't have to go on divisions and then off we went to ilfracombe and ilfracombe i was there for quite a while
