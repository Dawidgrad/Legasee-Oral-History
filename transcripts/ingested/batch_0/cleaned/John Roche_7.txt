how was the ship with someone like an admiral on board what was the discipline like well of course we were the senior ship there with the admiral on board we had a good combination we had admiral somerville and we had a captain called mcgregor and he became an admiral afterwards they got on really well together we used to call him mac and him and somerville got on fine somerville used to walk around the ship and he would talk to you if he were going past normally you'd only say good morning or good evening but he was a pretty good guy if you were in gibraltar he might have been out in his dingy in the morning with his sports gear on pulling in a dingy around the harbour for a bit of exercise he was a good egg if you like somerville was a very popular admiral did you speak to him yes i didn't speak to him he spoke to me unless he was doing an inspection or something inspecting divisions or something like that then he would single someone out and talk to them it sounds up to this point that renown was quite a lucky ship she was a very lucky ship yes we got hit a couple of times up norway in nineteen forty when we were off narvick when they were trying to land up there we were in action with those two and the glow worm she was with us too she went away to investigate and she was sunk so we engaged these two but again there were horrendous seas and bad visibility and they managed to escape we done a bit of damage to both of them other than that the only other damage we had was that a load of aircraft came to attack us one malta convoy and we had these four five guns we had twenty of those and there were three twin turrets on each of those and these low flying torpedo aircrafts came in and these guns were low and depressed and were hard to shoot at these aircrafts skimming over the water one of our guns ended up firing into the gun next door to it and ended up killing ten of our people so we had to go in and pick up all the bodies that were clinging on to parts of the gun sew them up in mail bags and then bury them at sea off gibraltar i think we lost around eight or ten men boys i think as well so the main damage was what we done to ourselves how did that affect morale everybody was a bit sad because they would have been peoples mess mates and we knew them very well they were all lads we knew one minute they'll be firing a gun and the next they were dead it was a very sad occasion really were you part of the party that helped clear up i was in the fecundity because i was up in that turret area if i was in that turret i would have been killed as well i suppose i was in and out of these gun turrets so we saw everything that was happening everybody had to muck in i suppose and that gun was out of action you couldn't use it anymore when you were under attack do you recall hitting any of the planes oh i think so i mean i think everybody claimed more than they did but there were ten ships firing so it makes it difficult to know who hit what plane so now and again you'd see a plane dive into the water and you'd give it three cheers or something then somebody would say i done that and somebody else on another ship would say the same thing were you every aware of what you was escorting did you know what the ships were carrying some of the malta runs we knew because we were escorting aircraft carriers one of them was the uss wasp we were carrying aircrafts and spitfires to malta we hoped to get within striking distance to malta so they could then fly out to go and help the maltese air force so a lot of it was reinforcing the air defences in malta we were loading spitfires up and taking them to malta and also big merchant ships i mean you may see tanks on deck or something but you wouldn't know what they were all carrying you wouldn't really be interested what they ship was carrying wouldn't make a lot of difference to us really out main job was to get it there it must have been impressive seeing all the spitfires being taken off deck yes there were a couple mix ups a few times because some ships would run out of fuel and would never make it a lot of them weren't fully prepared they would arrive in malta and they would be destroyed after a few days because they wouldn't be ready for operation when they got there it was nice to see them all going off it was nice to know they had all landed safely tell me about operation torch what was renown doing on that we were standing off really because there were so many ships there coming in a big american fleet of ships landing troops and everything so we were more or less off the coast giving support to any of the italian ships german ships may have come to interfere with the landing that was in nineteen forty two when we were landing in north africa we thought well we are getting somewhere now there were a lot of ships involved you were part of a big team i suppose escorting all these ships and landing crafts and various other types of ships with stores and things like that you know were you involved in firing on to the land at all i don't think we did for torch i don't think we done any bombardments for torch we done bombardments for other places but not for torch i don't think was that the biggest fleet you had ever seen as a young person i suppose it was in the wartime really the biggest amount of ships in one place at one time there were two or three different lots of them the advanced party the mid party and then the final party as it were all various types of ships coming in and landing and once they secured a couple of ports or something they'd be able to go in and unload
