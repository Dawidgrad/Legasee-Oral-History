how many were people killed during the torpedo attack no we only lost two fortunately one was the deck boy and he just disappeared we don't know what happened to him he was probably blown away in the explosion and the other was the second engineer who was burnt in our boat we were very fortunate that we only lost two people now the commodore was in his uniform but he borrowed a jacket to put over it because if the submarine had seen a rear admiral they would have taken him prisoner so he was off and along with everybody he was in our boat actually what was it like to see the u boat that attacked you just sat there watching well it was just circling around with a camera going you know and then it must have been on german newsreel i suppose this hessler guy did a report on it which i read after he was a u boat ace and he married doenitz's niece so he was quite in touch with the high command and after the war he was employed by the royal navy to write the history and now he mentioned this sinking he said this was a q ship and it wasn't we were not an armed naval ship now those were in the first world war when the u boats used to attack and the ships would drop their sides and there would be guns there and they would fight back you know we were an armed merchant ship we had one anti submarine gun but we weren't one of these specialist ships but he may have thought that we were carrying aircraft on deck beaufighters for the royal air force we were taking those to west africa and from there they were flown to the middle east for the north african battle you see so these were in the sea they were blown up they were sinking around so perhaps he thought that was the reason why but we weren't that we were a merchant ship you mentioned there were two life rafts were you able to keep with the other life raft through the storm now we got separated the other boat was picked up before we were actually as you know it is very difficult when you get currents and waves and things we had a bit of a sail we put up and you get separated you see we had a radio a distress radio in a big sort of portmanteau a big thing but that was in the boat that was in the water and was useless so we weren't able to make any communication and we couldn't have communicated with that one in any case because they didn't have one and there was no cell phones in those days and no satellites were there any women we didn't have any women on the ship no and what was the rear admiral like was he calm the sea was quite calm no the admiral that you had on board the commodore what was he like he was quite ok but you see he wasn't in command of the ship he was in command of the convoy you see and when he was in the lifeboat the commander of our lifeboat was the second officer who was a very good manager a good navigator he was the one who organised things on the boat dishing out the food and things like that and allocating different jobs to different people not the admiral what did you do if you needed the loo and stuff well you went over the side you just sat on the but you know you didn't really have much in the way of motion all the time because you weren't eating you only got a little bit of stuff to eat and to drink and so you might want to have a pee but number two wasn't very often if at all you see what was it like when you saw this plane come in and land and then take off again it must have been soul destroying it couldn't take any more people and it was it could only land on quite calm water otherwise it would be in difficulty you know it wasn't a sunderland they could take a lot of people but the sunderland's didn't land on the open sea when he took off we knew he knew where we were and that's why i think they sent out this ship to try to pick up but then with the storm we lost it in the night in the storm did you think that you might sink well it looked a bit like it yes but it was good seamanship by the second officer and we had what they called a sea anchor we put out as well that steadied the boat and put the bow into the waves and things like that did you a chart to navigate or was it stars astral no we had a compass we didn't have any sextants they all disappeared so we didn't get we could only rely on estimated positions you see but each lifeboat was fitted with a compass and we were going on that compass i mean we knew where we were when we were sunk so we knew where we had to go we knew the approximate distance now if we had been a bit further out in the atlantic maybe five hundred miles we would have had to go to brazil because we couldn't have gone against the currents and tides to west africa they were all sweeping across there and this happened to a number of lifeboats people were thirty forty days in the boat and very few of them survived so we were fortunate being fairly close to the mainland of africa
