my way of unwinding after a sticky convoy was i discovered the naval the navy ran a brothel and i went there originally for the obvious reason but very soon got attached to one girl and i would go in there and we'd have a cup of tea she even did my mending and we'd have a chat and it was wonderful to have a female company without you didn't need the sex she was there to get money to get married and i didn't mind i respected all those girls one particular time i came in there of an evening and i'd had a few beers and i'm sitting and in comes jack you see and he'd had a few beers and he took off his cap and slug it like one of those disk things you see and it caught my forehead here well up stands baden going to take over but no he didn't i was grabbed and i was in a room she wouldn't let me fight and i had to stay there with a cup of tea and sober up and you know it became quite a good friendship really did i was grateful the one thing we'd forgot about we did the first trip outside the harbour when i was sick but the first action i was on a oerlikon and old fashioned oerlikon that had a gunner did the elevation and i had to do the left right business and i was also the loader now when a magazine ran out see i'm on one side of the shield and the action side if there is any bullets coming never mind the gunner is behind the shield i was shaken so much with fear actual fear it was i could not load that magazine i could get it up there but i couldn't get it in he had to come around and do it were you actually under fire whilst this was happening oh yeah that's what it was about you know first time in action i'd never been in action then was this on the romeo this was on the romeo romeo and but after that no i was alright so once that moment had passed just that one time you know i suppose i've always said anyone first time into action whose not frightened is either an idiot or a damn fool you know i don't see how anybody could possibly say they saw no fear on their first dose of action like the gunner he never mentioned it if i seen it i wouldn't of mentioned it and the same after action i would say on the gun platform and i was with betty that was another way of calling it because you go down to the mess deck and somebody says something wrong everyone's on edge everyone no matter who they are you've only got to say something wrong everyone's on edge everyone no matter who they are and you've only got to say something wrong and you've got problems and betty was your pen friend well yes that's all that time i was in live with her but it was a pen friend i did that six weeks training and we were there together for six weeks but then i did meet another girl you see when i went to havant i met joyce and we became very friendly but i never followed that i was going into a war i didn't want to get involved anymore how important were the letters that betty wrote to you oh very much that was home it was like listening to vera lynn you know every you drop a pin when vera was on and you were in trouble so despite the fact when you started corresponding with betty she was only fourteen she actually sustained you through those difficult moments at sea very much so i've a lot to thank her for you know oh yes if you had something like that to hang on to you retained your sanity you know it's i think we all had our different ways of coping you had to have something you know and a lot of people say with min sweeping or that sort of sweeping how did you do that well you didn't think about it you don't when you're in action you don't think about it and you try not to think about it afterwards it's not something you dwell on that's why you won't find anything in my memories if somebody wants to know about action turn on the telly they can see it there war is not something to glory it's not you do what you do and at the end you forget it or try to but what you did you did and you coped in the best way you could yeah oh yes we all had our own ways i suppose i mean once i settled down i could go off and sup with the best off them you know we did i was what else you do when you have money in your pockets this brothel in alexandria which was run by the royal navy was there a way of acknowledging that sailors needed some way to let of steam yeah yeah and it was a safety valve for the navy because they knew then the men weren't going to go up town and catch a disease so it was closely regulated and medical checks and so on oh yes always and you even had penicillin to use afterwards you were always given a tube of penicillin you know to squeeze down there looking back to your time in action did you find yourself manning the oerlikon very often then at action stations that was my job yeah that was my job and the same on the wolburough there was one man oerlikon and i had that for a while and then he put me on the four inch not happy i didn't like that at all you were hanging about if you weren't actually getting the shells from there to the loader that sort of thing not if you could do something you didn't think but luckily we didn't have much problem on that one i think the only one that we not in anger i suppose we met this ship around the islands and she wouldn't respond to recognition you see and we put a star shell over her panic on that ship oh was there panic we did find out what she was and that she was a turkish job why they didn't answer i don't know but they did eventually when the star shells were coming over so did you ever hit anything with your oerlikon i don't think so i don't think so it's difficult now a plane is travelling pretty fast you've got to get so far ahead that you've got to judge the speed if they're going across your vision if they are coming towards you then the elevation is changing slowly and it's a difficult job to do it and of course that was really our armament the four inch was not much use for aircraft
