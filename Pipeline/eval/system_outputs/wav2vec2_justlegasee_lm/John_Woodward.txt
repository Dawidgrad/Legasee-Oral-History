NAME IS JOHN DOUGLAS WOOD WOOD I'M EIGHTY NINE YEARS OLD I WAS BORN ON THE SEVENTH OF APRIL NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR WHEN IN THE SERVICE I HAD ORIGINALLY JOINED TO BE A SIGNALLER AND THEY FOUND OUT I WAS COLOUR BLIND SO I WAS AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE STEWARDING BRANCH WHICH I DIDN'T WANT BUT YOU HAD NO CHOICE YOU DID WHAT YOU WERE TOLD AND I GOT TRANSFERRED TO MINE SWEEPERS AND I WAS BASED SHIP HERE AT QUEENSBOROGH QUEENSLAND QUEENS BOROUGH PEER AND WE HAD ABOUT TEN MINES FEVER THERE WE WENT OUT EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS TO SWEEP ANY MINES THAT HAD BEEN DROPPED BY THE BOATS IN THE HOPE OF SINKING OUR SUPPLY SHIPS WHY DID YOU JOIN THE NAVY BECAUSE I WANTED TO GIVE THEM THE FIGHT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND AT THE TIME I WAS WHAT ARE THEY CALLING A RESERVED OCCUPATION I WAS AN APPRENTICE AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER AND MY DAD DIDN'T WANT ME TO HE WAS IN THE LAST WAR HE WOULD HAVE PREFERRED ME TO LEARN A GOOD STEADY TRADE BUT I WANTED TO GO AS SOON AS I WAS EIGHTEEN I WENT FROM MAIDSTONE WHERE HOME WAS I CAME OVER TO CHATHAM TO PEMBROKE BARRACKS AND SIGNED UP I SAID I WAS NINETEEN BUT IT DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE THEY JUST ACCEPTED YOU IF YOU COULD BREATHE IT OUT AND MOVE YOUR ARMS YOU WERE PHYSICALLY FIT I WAS TOLD TO GO HOME AND WAIT AND I'D BE CONTACTED A WEEK LATER ON CAME REPORT TO CHATHAM BARRACKS ON SUCH AND SUCH A DAY I WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE WAR WITHOUT ACTUALLY SEEING A GERMAN WE HAD LONG RAGED FIGHTS WITH THEM BUT I NEVER ACTUALLY SAW A GERMAN WHY YOU KNOW YOU WANTED TO DO YOUR BIT BUT WHY DID YOU NOT JOIN THE ARMY OR THE REF I WAS NOT INTERESTED IN EITHER A TRADITIONAL FAMILY AND MY FATHER WAS IN THE NAVY SO WAS MY GRANDFATHER AND AN UNCLE MY GRANDFATHER WAS ON BEATING HIS FLAGSHIP THE LION AT THE BATTLE OF JUTLAND COME ON DECK FOR THREE DAYS HE WAS IN THE ENGINEERING BRANCH BUT THAT'S THE SERVICE I WANTED TO JOIN SO I DID WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF YOUR TRAINING IT'S RATHER CONFUSED WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND YOU DON'T TAKE THINGS IN SO EASILY BUT FROM PEMBROKE HOUSE PEMBROKE BARRACKS WE WERE ALL MARCHED DOWN TO FURTHER DOWN THE YARD WHERE WE GOT FITTED OUT AND AT THAT TIME EVERYONE LESS OF AN OFFICER WORE THE SAME AND HALF RIG WITH BELL BOTTOMS THE SCAR THE HAT SENT UP TO SKEGNESS WITH ANOTHER BUNCH TO BUTLINS HOLIDAY CAMP AND THAT BECAME HMS ROYAL ARTHUR AND I WAS TO START TRAINING AS A TELEGRAPHIST SIGNALLER I'VE BEEN DOING MORSE CODE STARTED ON THE MORSE CODE FOR ABOUT A FORTNIGHT THEN SOMEBODY SAID THIS LOT HAVEN'T HAD A CLOTTEY BETTER HAVE IT MOST OF THEM PASSED BUT TWO OTHERS AND ME STRONGLY COLOR BLIND SO YOU'RE OUT IF YOU SEND THE WRONG COLORS WHEN YOU'RE SIGNALLING IT WOULD BE A DISASTER THAT'S WHEN I WAS TRANSFERRED TO MINE SWEEPERS ON THE STEWARDING BRANCH WERE YOU DISAPPOINTED YES NOBODY LIKED BEING ON MINE SWEEPERS WE ALL KEPT PUTTING IN FOR TRANSFER TO SOMETHING MORE GLAMOROUS DESTROYERS SUBMARINES T GS BUT ALWAYS GOT TURNED DOWN YOU'RE DOING AN IMPORTANT JOB YOU WILL STAY PUT AND THAT WAS IT MANY PEOPLE ON ONE OF THESE MINE SWEEPERS WHAT WAS THE BOAT LIKE FIVE OFFICERS AND ABOUT TWELVE FIFTEEN CREW THAT INCLUDES THE ENGINEERS AT THE STOKER BRANCH THEY CALLED IT SIGNALING AND THOSE DOING THE ACTUAL MIND DETECTING WHEN WE FIRST STARTED WENT OUT MINE SWEEPING IT WAS THREE DAYS ON ONE DAY OFF AND WE HAD TWO STANDING IN THE BOWS WITH RIFLES WHEN THEY SAW A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING BY THEY'D SHOOT AT IT HIT THE HORNS AND BLOW IT UP BUT THAT WAS WHEN THEY STARTED THE MINE SWEEPING CAMPAIGN AND THE GERMANS WHEN THEY DROPPED THEM HAD LONG WEIGHTS ON WIRES SO THEY JUST FLOATED THE SURFACE TO HIT THE SHIP ONE OF THOSE WIRES CAME LOOSE THE MINE WOULD BOB ON THE SURFACE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOKED FOR EACH TIME WE WENT OUT WHEN THE GERMANS OCCUPIED FRANCE OF COURSE GOT RIGHT ON THE COAST LINE HE HAD BIG GUNS AT ARENA AND THEY USED TO POP AWAY AT US EVERY TIME WE CAME OUT UNFORTUNATELY WE NEVER GOT HIT THERE WAS ONE AMUSING ANECDOTE COMMODORE HAD BEEN A SENIOR CAPTAIN BEFORE THE WAR HE RETIRED OF COURSE AND HE WAS BROUGHT BACK IN AND MADE COMMODORE OF THE MINE SWEEPING FLEET HE HAD HIS TWELVE MINE SWEEPERS AND WE USED TO GO OUT AND DO THE SAME THING EVERY DAY GERMANS BEING VERY METICULOUS OUT WE'LL SAY FRIDAYS AND TUESDAYS NOT ONLY THE SAME DAY BUT AT THE SAME TIME TO LAY THEIR MINDS AND THEN DASHED BACK IN WE WENT OUT THE FOLLOWING MORNING EACH TIME TO PICK THEM UP AND THE SKIPPER GOT A BIT FED UP WITH THIS HE TOLD THE CONFERENCE OF HIS CAPTAIN ONE DAY THE NEXT TIME WE GO SWEEPING RUN YOUR TROLLS OUT BUT DON'T DROP YOUR WIRES WHICH OF COURSE CONTRARY TO ALL NAVAL INSTRUCTIONS THAT YOU COULD HAVE GOT CAUGHT MARSHAL IF ANY HAPPENED BUT WE WENT THROUGH GERMAN MINEFIELD AS THEY'D LAID IT AND WE GOT AWAY WITH IT THE GERMANS CAME OUT AGAIN TO REPLACE THE MINES THEY THOUGHT WE'D PICKED UP AND THEY LOST FOUR OF THEIR OWN BOATS ON THEIR OWN MINES AND I DON'T THINK THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY SPORTING IS THAT DOCUMENTED COMMENTED SOMEWHERE IN THE ADMIRALTY ARCHIVES ANYTHING GOOD IDEA HE COULD HAVE GOT INTO A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR THAT WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN WE WENT OUT I WAS DUE TO REPORT WITH SIX OTHER STEWARDS WE REPORTED TO THE FIRST LIEUTENANT WERE DAMAGED CONTROL PARTY IF THE SHIP GOT HIT WE HAD TO CLEAR THE DAMAGE AWAY PUT OUT ANY FIRES AND PULL THE WOUNDED INTO THE WAR ROOM WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS WAITING TO DO WHAT HE COULD BUT FORTUNATELY IT NEVER HAPPENED THAT WAS MY OFFICIAL STATION AND WHAT ABOUT BAD WEATHER AND STORMS AND STUFF DID YOU EVER ENCOUNTER ANY DANGERS WHEN YOU HAD WHAT ANY STORMS BAD WEATHER BIG SEAS WE HAD SOME YES BUT WE STILL WENT OUT YOUR SOUTHWEST AND THAT WAS IT WE HAD SAFETY LINES RIGGED FORE AND AFT SO YOU HOLD ON TO THOSE YOU WOULDN'T GET WASHED OVERBOARD WHAT ABOUT WHAT WAS IT LIKE WATCHING THE PLANES TAKING GOING OVER YOU AND STUFF DID YOU SEE MUCH ACTIVITY IN THE AIR WE FORTUNATE WE NEVER GOT ATTACKED FROM THE AIR I DON'T THINK THE GERMANS THOUGHT OUR LITTLE BOATS WERE WORTH WASTING A BOMB ON THEY WANTED FOR THE CAPITAL CITIES OR THE AIR FIELDS WERE YOU INVOLVED IN D DAY AT ALL YES NOW A WEEK BEFORE D DAY WAS SHUT DOWN LIKE AN OYSTER NOBODY COULD GO OFF YOU KNOW WAS ALLOWED IN FOR SECURITY REASONS OBVIOUSLY YOU COULDN'T GET ANY POST YOU COULDN'T MAKE ANY PHONE CALLS BECAUSE IT WAS COMING UP ALTHOUGH OFFICIALLY WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS BEFORE DAY ON ADMIRALTY INSTRUCTIONS WE'D STARTED NIGHT SWEEPING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DAY SHIFT SO THE GERMANS WERE GETTING USED TO THE IDEA OF POPPING ALONG THE COAST DURING THE HOURS OF DARKNESS THEY WOULDN'T THINK ANY OF IT SO MORNING OF D DAY WE WENT OUT AT MIDNIGHT AND WE WERE SWEEPING RIGHT UP TO THE LINE WHERE THE BATTLESHIPS WERE WAITING TO BOMBARD THE COAST WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE STATIONED AND WE SWEPT THAT MOST CAREFULLY AND THEN AS THEY STARTED COMING UP OUT OF THE DARKNESS FROM TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WAITING AND WE WERE TIRED BEHIND THEM THERE WASN'T ANYTHING ELSE FOR US TO DO WE GOT SENT BACK HERE TO THE ISLE OF SHEPPEY WHEN THE TROOPS WENT ASHORE ANNOYED BECAUSE WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING AND THEN EIGHT OR NINE DAYS LATER THE SKIPPER GOT THE ORDERS TO PATROL THE DUTCH COAST ON THE SET AND PICK UP ALL THE MINES WHICH THE GERMANS HAD SOWN LIBERALLY AROUND THE COAST THERE SO THAT KEPT US BUSY FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS WE WERE STATIONED AT A LITTLE TOWN CALLED TEREZIN A VERY SMALL PORT BUT THERE WAS A LONG JETTY SO WE COULD MORE ALONGSIDE THERE AND EVENINGS LATE AFTERNOON YOU GOT SHORE LEAVE UNTIL YOU WERE GOING OFF AGAIN NEXT MORNING AND I'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN THE THINGS WE SAW WHEN WE WENT ASHORE THE GERMANS HAD GOT OUT IN A HURRY THEIR SIGNS WERE EVERYWHERE ON A HOTEL LOUNGE THAT THERE HAD BEEN IN AN OFFICER'S MESS AND THE SIGNS WERE STILL UP AND THEY BLEW SOME OF THE BRIDGES OVER THE CANALS AS THEY LEFT AND THE DUTCH FLOODED SOME OF THE DIKES TO STOP THEIR HEAVY TRAFFIC GETTING AWAY AND I REMEMBER ONCE WE WEREN'T ASHORE CARRIED A NAVY RAINCOAT DRAPED OVER YOUR ARMS FOLDED IN A CERTAIN WAY AND THE OFFICER OF WATCH KNEW VERY WELL WE HAD THINGS IN THEIR POCKETS CIGARETTES PACKAGE OF BISCUITS TILL JAM OR WHATEVER WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN OFF THE SHIP WE WERE GIVING IT TO THE DUTCH CIVILIANS BECAUSE THEY WERE AS STARVED AS HELL AND LOOKED VERY ILL ON THIS OCCASION WE GOT ASHORE I SAW A VERY THIN AGE LOOKING WOMAN COMING UP THE STREET PUSHING A BATTERED PRAM AND SHE GOT TWO LITTLE KIDS IN THERE THREE OR A BIT LESS I SUPPOSE ONE BLANKET COVER THEM AND OFF MY HAT GOOD DAY AND SHE GAVE ME A SMILE SHE COULDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH I COULDN'T SPEAK DUTCH BUT I TOOK OUT WHAT I HAD AND I PUT IT IN HER PRAM SHOULD SEE THE LOOK ON HER FACE SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS COME TO ICE WHAT THEY DIDN'T EAT THEY COULD ALWAYS TRADE FOR SOMETHING ELSE HAD GONE BACK WITH MORE BUT IT WASN'T TO BE AFTER WE GOT RID OF MOST OF THE MINES DUTCH COAST WE HAD A WEEK'S LEAVE WELL OBVIOUSLY WE WEREN'T COMING BACK HERE FOR IT IT WOULD BE ON THE DUTCH COAST AND I HAD ANOTHER FELLOW WE GOT ONTO MAIN ROAD WHICH WAS THE BRUSSELS ROAD LEADING TO BELGIUM AND THUMBED LIFTS FROM ARMY LORRIES WHICH ARE ALWAYS GOING UP AND DOWN AND WE GOT INTO ABOUT THE THREE HOURS A BIT LESS INTO ROUGE WHICH ONE WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CITIES I'VE SEEN TWO CATHEDRALS AN OPERA HOUSE AND THE TOWN HALL FOUR SIDES OF THE MAIN SQUARE AND ONE OF THE HOTELS HAD BEEN TAKEN OVER AS A NAPPY THE TROOPS BED AND BREAKFAST SO WE STAYED THERE AND WE ENJOYED OURSELVES WHEN WE CAME BACK WE GOT ORDERED BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AND WE WERE STILL LOOKING FOR MINES WHICH MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED DETECTION GOING UP AND DOWN BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH URGENCY IN IT ANY MORE AND I DID PUT IN ON TO SIT FOR LEADING STEWARD BUT BEFORE THAT COULD TAKE PLACE MY DISCHARGE PAPERS CAME THROUGH AND THAT WAS IN EARLY EARLY NINETEEN FORTY NINETEEN FORTY SIX NINETEEN NINETEEN FORTY SIX YES AFTER THE WAR BUT UNLIKE THE ARMY OR THE AIR FORCE WE GOT PLENTY OF NOTICE WHEN IT WAS COMING I KNOW PEOPLE IN THE AIR FORCE AND THEY WERE GIVEN THREE DAYS NOTICE AND THEY WERE OUT IN THE NAVY WE HAD TIME TOLD YOU'VE GOT TO BE DEMOBBED IN THREE MONTHS THEY GIVE YOU TIME TO START LOOKING AROUND FOR A CIVILIAN JOB OR SOMEWHERE TO LIVE IF YOU'RE MARRIED WITH KIDS I THINK WE HAD A BETTER DEAL CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOU TALK ABOUT THIS MINE SWEEPING JUST EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WERE DOING WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MINES WELL LOOKED LIKE YARDS FROM THE MAIN MAST STRETCHED OUT EITHER SIDE ABOUT FIFTY FEET AND FROM THESE ARE DEPENDING VERY SHARP CUTTING WIRES WITH WEIGHTS ON THE END GO THROUGH THE WATER THE IDEA IS TO YOUR CUTTING WIRES TO CATCH THE MOORING WIRES FOR A MINE AND CUT IT THE MINE COMES TO THE SURFACE AND YOU WOULD DISPOSE OF IT HOW MANY MINES WOULD YOU FIND ON AN AVERAGE DAY ON AVERAGE POSSIBLY A DOZEN POSSIBLY ONLY TWO VARIED AND THE DISPOSAL WOULD BE A SHOT WOULD IT THAT'S WHAT IT STALLED THEN THE GERMANS EVENTUALLY ACOUSTIC MINE WHICH WASN'T BOARD IT WAS JUST DROPPED CHANNEL HOPEFULLY IN THE PATH OF ONCOMING SHIPS AND IT EMITTED A MAGNETIC FIELD FROM BATTERIES THAT WERE INSIDE EVERY SHIP AS IT GOES ALSO MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD AND WHEN THE TWO COLLIDE THE MINE GOES UP SO WE HAD TO HAVE WHAT WAS CALLED GAZING EQUIPMENT A SPECIAL COIL FITTED RIGHT AROUND THE SHIP THE CURRENT IS PASSED THROUGH THAT ANTI CLOCKWISE AND THAT NULLIFIES THE EFFECT OF THE ELECTRONIC FIELD AND YOU COULD GO OVER MINES ALRIGHT COULD YOU FIND THOSE MINES WE FOUND HIM YES SOMETIMES THE GERMANS GOT CRAFTED AND THEY DROPPED SOME OF THESE MINES AT NIGHT FROM LOW FLYING PLANES AND WE GOT BACK I WASN'T THERE I WAS ON A COUPLE OF DAYS LEAVE AND I WENT HOME TO MAIDSTONE BUT I WAS TOLD OUR SQUADRON CAME BACK FROM PATROL THE LAST SHIP IN SLID INTO ITS PLACE ON THE JETTY AND PROBABLY BLEW UP BECAUSE THERE WAS A MINE ON AND IT'S BEEN DROPPED BY A PLANE THE SKIPPER OF THIS LAST BOAT AS IT WAS ONLY SIX FEET FROM THE JETTY I GOT IT DOUSE EQUIPMENT SWITCHED OFF I THINK THERE WAS TWO SURVIVORS BUT WHO THEY WERE I DON'T KNOW HOW WOULD YOU FIND I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD FIND A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING IN THE WATER YOU CUT IT AND IT FLOATS TO THE TOP HOW DID YOU FIND THESE MAGNETIC MINES WERE THEY ON THE BOTTOM OR ON THE BOTTOM YES HOW DID YOU FIND THAT WELL LIKE A SONAR DEVICE IT PICKS UP RADIATION FROM THE MINE AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHERE IT IS A DEPTH CHARGE ON IT YOU SET THE DEPTH CHARGE FOR TWENTY FEET OR THIRTY WHATEVER IT IS AND JUST PUT THEM OVER THE SIDE ON A GUN IN HOLLAND WHEN YOU GOT TO HOLLAND YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW ARE THERE ANY OTHER MEMORIES OF JUST DEVASTATION WHEN THE GERMANS GOT OUT IN HURRIED THEY TOOK EVERYONE WITH THEM ALIVE OR DEAD AND BLEW A COUPLE OF BRIDGES AND THEN RETREATED TOWARD BELGIUM DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE WINNING THE WAR AT THAT STAGE YES HAD COME THE INVASION HAD STARTED AND WE WERE PUSHING INLAND FROM THE BEACHES WE HADN'T BEEN SHOVED BACK OFF AGAIN AND IT WAS STARTING TO BITE WHEN YOU WERE PULLED OUT OF D DAY WE WERE YOU ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WAS GOING ON ON D DAY AFTER THE BATTLE SHIPS HAD ARRIVED YOU COME BACK TO BAY WERE YOU AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR GUNS GOING ON WHEN THE BROADSIDE STATED YES I THINK THAT WAS QUARTER TO SIX EIGHT MILES OF SHIPS UP AT THE SAME TIN WE ALREADY GOT INFORMATION FROM THE UNDERGROUND AND RESISTANCE WORKERS WHERE THE GERMAN STRONG POINTS WERE ALL ALONG THE CLIFF TOPS HEAVY GUN IN PLACEMENTS BUNKERS FOR TROOPS AND SO ON AND THEY GOT CONTINUOUS PLASTERING AND THEY HADN'T QUITE FINISHED IT WAS TWO HOUR BOMBARDMENT HALF AN HOUR FOR IT STOPPED THE BOATS WERE GOING ASHORE WITH THE TROOPS DID YOU HEAR IT WE WERE ON THE WAR BEHIND THEM WE HEARD IT WAS ALL RIGHT A DEAFENING CRESCENDO OF NOISE NOTHING LIKE IT YOU WEREN'T EVEN NEAR IT WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER V DAY OH THAT WAS AGAIN MARVELLOUS I WAS WAITING THE MOB AND OF COURSE WE GOT RATHER MORE LEAVE ONCE PEACE WAS DECLARED AND I GOT I THINK IT WAS A FOUR DAY PASS TO GO HOME TO MAIDSTONE AND I CAME UP ON THE TRAIN TO VICTORIA AND THE PLACE WAS JUST ONE SEETHING MASS OF PEOPLE EVERY UNIFORM EVERYTHING YOU COULD THINK OF EVERYONE WAS SINGING DANCING LAUGHING WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS BECAUSE THEY LET THE HAIR DOWN AND IN FRONT OF BUCKINGHAM PALACE YOU COULD HAVE GOT A SHOE ON IN THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS STRETCHING BACK DOWN THEM ALL WAITING FOR THE KING AND QUEEN AND WINSTON TO COME ON THE BALCONY AND THE ROAR THAT WENT UP MUST HAVE GONE ON FOR ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES NON STOP HOW DO YOU REFLECT ON YOUR NAVY SERVICE NOW I'M I'M GLAD I WENT IT MEANS I OF OTHERS WE DON'T HAVE TO READ ABOUT HISTORY WE WERE MAKING IT WE WERE PART OF THAT HISTORY AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF ARE THERE ANY OTHER STORIES YOU WANT TO SHARE I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY AS I SAY IT REMINDS US EVEN AS A VERY DULL OCCUPATION WITH OCCASIONAL SHORT PERIODS OF ACTIVITY LIKE DESTROYERS OR BATTLESHIPS YOU'RE NOT ENGAGED PERMANENTLY WITH THE OPPOSITE NUMBER WERE THERE ANY OCCASIONS WHERE YOU WERE ENGAGED WE WERE NEVER ATTACKED BY PLANES AS I SAID WE DIDN'T SEE ANY GERMAN TROOPS THE ONLY CONTACT WE HAD WAS WHEN THEIR LONG RANGE GUNS ON THE FRENCH COAST TRIED TO GET US WHILE WE WERE MINE SWEEPING BUT THEY DIDN'T
