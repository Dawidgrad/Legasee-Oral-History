and what was your first ship and what was it like setting sail from liverpool was it from liverpool yes we sailed on the alfred jones this was my first trip from liverpool in may nineteen forty one and we went out out to the irish sea and then we went round the north north part of ireland to keep away from france and so on with the germans occupied it and out into the atlantic and then the convoy broke up mid atlantic and we went individually then and we went to west africa what was it like setting sail for that first time would you you remember it well you know you got a bit sea sick in your first for a that's understandable and a but there before there were four cadets always for cadets and the something were second or third year you see sir they helped you to realize what was going on and then you you had a special cabin for the for the cadets or midshipmen the two different names the same people and we at with the officers were classified as officers and the food was very good actually and we had passengers on the ship too and so you be with the passengers the many passages but the passengers there and so it was much better than eating in england wartime england and it was quite hard work though you you had you had to do sort of four hours on four hours off and during the war in dangers arms you had what they called double watches and you had spent seem hard alan time to sleep the most time you got off was four hours and by the time you got into bed and had a sleep woken up again you had about three hours sleep you know a that was on what they call a double watches normally it was four hours on a four and eight hours off but during the during the war in these areas with which it was difficult than it was to get more people on deck for look out and manning the guns it was far down far off you see just tell me about the alfred what was it like as a ship a bit the size what you you know you your mess et cetera a well the we had on that ship we had about seventy people as we were commodores ship as well and we had the commodore a retired vice admiral and his staff and then we had twelve passengers and then we had our own crew and in those days the crews are much bigger than they are today and because the ship didn't have such a quick turn around and you had to do a lot of the work on the ship and painting and so on you know and so the you know i cried enjoyed it in a way and whence once you got into the tropics it was beautiful the if you had a calm sea beautiful night in or the stars and so on and the dolphins jumping up down ahead of the bows that was very beautiful and why did the outfits why did the convoys let well the ships went to different places you see they hold convey couldn't go to one place because some ships were going to america some re going to south america some were going to the mediterranean some were going to south africa some to west africa but the the idea was to take the ships through the most difficult part of the voyage where there were german submarines and also a german aircraft could sort of reach them you see and that's why we went straight out into the atlantic to get out of range of the german bones and before we split up but then later on the submarines adapted a different tactic instead of learned submarines and learned ships you know that look for they had convoys attacks some convoys with the wolf packs i remember on one particular convoy we were in we got a message from we were commodore ship again we got a message from the atlantic expect a tack developing from ahead by twelve submarines in fact there were more we could see them during the day they were cruising along a stern of the convoy on the surface and then at night they'd come on the surface again and we had a better speed than most of the esescorts that we had our covets couldn't keep up with them they'd come round ahead go down torpedo the leading ships go down through the lines and out stead and although we had an anti submarine gun we couldn't rely fired at them there because you might hit another ship on the other side you see so they were very clever in the tactics so that was very difficult sometimes that would happen for days on end and it would only stop when you got air cover to spot them you know but when we were actually torpedoed that was alone taught on a submarine by a submarine as named hessler and he was lurking around at west africa to get the ships out of convoy because free time was an assembly point for convoys going up to england but the ships came in on their own and so they were waiting outside a hundred miles hundred and fifty miles outside for lone ships to to blow up
