so you've decided to do your best what do you remember of that enrollment process am well i had to go tipsy at one time edinburgh capital glasgow dandy was the third city aberdeen fourth when the oil came around of course abedin is third city now but at that time i had to go to dundee for my medical now the strange thing about that was when i got out of the station i'd never been to care for before and yet i know i knew where i was going i knew exactly what room i was going to head for and i could never understand that that was most strange but obviously i was meant to go in the rent to go there for my medical and i have passed it obviously and then got the call up and did my training at bali on lalomand which was rather nice except that before that are we got there before the renter grove the americans had been there and they left lock stock and battle leaving dirty things here there and everywhere you know and when we got there they were building new lose but until they were finished we had these open loos you know i didn't like that at all in fact there were five of us that we got off after lunch every day and five of us used to hair down to ballastation to have a you know a comfortable can see because it was awful to sit and then somebody else coming in and then of course what they had to do is to empty those daily but that didn't last for long because the others the flush loos were already within a few days but until the you ought to sent away her down the valley dick had a less lose you know how did you you know you you mentioned that you were a country girl but how did you find that sort of i imagine a very relaxed comfortable you know okay tough but but carefree existence to military life how did you find that change i don't know i'll tell you is that while am this contingent was there the wrens could within the two weeks training if they didn't like it they could leave i don't think this applied to the wife all the eight years but there were two girls and i mean you were put to scrubbing floors and things like that it's all part and parcel of your training and these two girls did us wouldn't do it you see and off they went they weren't going to and yet one of the permanent staff there are a leading ren had said to them it's not like this when you finish your training it's only he you'll be doing this she won't be doing that elsewhere you know but they didn't listen so i don't know i just scrubbed the floors and dinners of a store more or less and well i think if you set your mind to do something and you want to do it you have to get over the initial training or whatever was it military store it isn't he sons like it was city military bases well you've got all to talk about squad bashing of course you had elite tallest on the right shortest on the left i always knew where i had to go because i'm so short left but again you didn't do much of that afterwards you only did that you know while you were there but i was very glad i wasn't the shortest about the third the shortest when i was there so i was quite happy because when they do the right wheel and left wheel et cetera i'd be going the wrong way i'm sure but i enjoyed it we had a test i don't know if everybody did but i certainly had am this test was to do with the say arithmetic and various things am in case you wanted to be supplies or whatever but as i got the whole of the paper right they didn't know what to do with me so that's why i ended up as a messenger to start with but having said that we then went down to from there we went down to earls court and boston gardens with a holding depo before you're posted on to somewhere else you see now we were all scots there near nearly all of us were scots come sunday we had to go on divisions you know what divisions are you know when and so we marched to the church and as we got to the door of course the normal squad halt catholics fall out so in we went and it was very very high charge they were swinging the incense and chanting and we had such a simple service you see in scotland where i was not to but glasgow would have been different but the east of scotland and different very simple and come the next sunday a those of us that were still there said shall we ask if we can fall out like a catholic so will you be spokeswoman so we all went there but i was spokeswoman and i said well we know we've got to go on divisions et cetera but really can we fall out and go to a church of our own you know scotland just a scotland or something because it was far too high for us we didn't want to bob up and down you know that kind of thing and we were told by the regulating petty officer on duty you are here for such a short time that you're more or less do as you do and now i didn't like that that's the only thing that i had a quibble about because i don't think that should have been happening and what can you do about it we didn't want to be on commanders defaulters and so we did as we were to then the following week of course most of us had gone after that but you were there usually about two weeks maybe three and then off to plymouth and a plymouth was again a holding depot but we were in houses in manamd and one of the arena houses had been bombed just two doors up from where we were as they did have it quite badly bombing in in plymouth and we're there for about another two weeks but we didn't have to go on divisions and then off we went to ilfracombe and elfrecomer was there for quite a while
