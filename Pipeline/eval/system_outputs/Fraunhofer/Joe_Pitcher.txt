at night anyway we finally come into this harbour show content any wires nova scotia isn't that all ireland there noticing a harbour finish all guns so you can unload your guns and so we'd all were unloaded ours and back in emotion bruin up and a cup of tea well suddenly this head huh you know first trip to sail a thing hey come in with his a marlin gun he head while a marlin gun the trigger i think miss eugenia craft as well it is a sort of nails shape job and then you farley well we all sit around shopping or coffee and he have flung me onto the missile haakon loader bloody thing the tracer random my honesty is choices and the armour piercing citizenship so i will john on the deck well there's one blast and we'll dine on an astonished triggers released because it may affect it hit me on the day i hit my honour ages as miss tidal starred it so it was a lot of luck as a george's in one knew it and nobody he didn't tell her skip or nothing like that i mean it's wonderful cost you can handle her but he found it no that was that yeah and the other thing has assigned trip i mean there's my first took on her i went i was off duty later on a date with your off to evander's your wish if you don't want to sleep ah i saw this hose uh and i thought while the weather was warm what ashore and i sorely stop cock i'm not i will i will go and nothing and i i suppose i should off i don't know anymore one of the things i didn't know it was torn that was the magazine the rule of law or i mean it with that all four inch gun yeah you too far it you you push your shell in rhyme home a new put a cordite in a short bag in and then as a spark in west authority well wait they come a larger savor it had in the action for his which we hadn't and examined the you know what was your amber ammunition i try to do please don't sign it and how did what they say please sir i did it so i kept core in i mean no problem they took it all ashore droid it out that loot the cord arch in and so bags you can draw it out it's one of those save where there is i should have reported alas foes but i didn't know you say i said i mean they should have been a lock amanda the thing but it wasn't so i i done wrong there anyway we had a trip ashore please don't are one trip ashore at the montreal a montreal it was wonderful um well we had a trip ashore and uh a delightful or honors lovely we done shopping for the girls and i mean what do you know where were you two were all as we're twenty twenty one twenty two that the bloods rising talk thing and uh well we've got a girlfriend at home or yknow could you just put it dress on or whatever or put a brassiere on and i have a tour round we did all this and i fell anyway lovelier it you're right anyway that was it and then we went down further on a picks out wait for me and how the port and a white where or why i to say again i mean so they tell me the launch freezes up in the winter and we were prior there's gonna be a heavy frost but now we're there back to sea again as a siege and any right farley we've come into nor shields with the cargo they just cargo weight i mean we had tanks we said welded to the tape deck um and that's where you are there well ah i didn't get onto well with our couldn't some idle no one was in power that weather because i'd killed a rat i don't know but i didn't i wasn't going on to where were the crew shall i saw well i did have a problem with the wisdom tooth so i thought well i'll i'll go shake and you get off so do the wisdom to when you say you were getting on very well with your crew i mean houses that manifest itself on a ship for somebody doesn't know what life is like on a ship how did you feel why did you feel that way well so funny fellow made us rather awesome there's a lot of marriage just gone wrong yeah you're going to get up red which are good i mean i did have probably wisdom to serve the top i'll use it to get off his ship but funnily enough having said that that ship was clubbed as next i mean this is what i'm thinking of leisure very allowed the fortunate life i suppose i i survived and that ship was sunk and i've got all the details here was sunk the next stroke what was it like to get on to a new ship what a lovely because everything was brand new everything was brand new so well informed match but what was your mess like ah well just an ordinary restaurant we slept in banks it wasn't how much you slept in function careers originally comfort or comfortable yeah a wherewith where was that sailing them well i well remember i mean we actually loaded and we didn't know where we go in but we loaded at least we come out of the idea of the the time near the time to leith as could travel nor to load i never saw river general solar cargo and cozy turn out to be but the torch effort where why algae is where the yanks and british went into algiers casablanca anna arraigned show her what was your cargo gino well general cargo uh i mean a beacons we took constable and a general nephi stores you are general cargo did you have any sense that this was a different convoy well we just didn't know what will we were not told anything on that score so we just accepted it it wasn't till we got sort of down near the medi that you did well your movers involves somewhere near raining show irene that first trip we got through we've got into port discharge or cargo and a white back we went back to newport in in wiles till another cargo and uh ah why we went to say again uh and we knew them we were gone back to al how algiers again uh can i ask you about algiers because it was my big convoy was while i was i mean what when we fondly and when we finally went through the straits a jew well initially before we windsor discharged we were actually bombay the high level bomber coming over rise so high that i mean all guns couldn't touch it but why we had a on deck we had a rescue launch which we had a police her ud our dinner where they lost the interval one but they were gonna crude easy to me a rescue cried if any shippers in problem in the mediterranean as the idea while i said after his trip i mean to my even gotta a bucket out there with you if you wanted to rob a rum he added a ship which they did pro i said well you know while i sir what way we used to drop him bombs were we not used to be near where they come in down so any right that that was that anyway refunded when we got through bigger expert escorts come out a g of we as a distortion and i think we had a cruiser with us one thing well where we are safe here now cause you to go into a guy but now we were we were torpedoed where we've got a hit forehead and um ah well have mainly but i mean haven't been hit the hatch covers a blown up in the air this rubbish or timber which covers a hedge well as one come down one of one of the long bitch aboard it landed on a war which ran from the funnel to the bridge well let's set chauffeur sorry a while a long bossed on the sarin is abandoned chip well well i mean we weren't we weren't sinking all are we were well listed the skipper immediately left the convoy and sod mike and for the shore this would be more as observation or ran with his shoulder a nice trip from algiers where we mike and fool show ah panic aboard an arm in these lads come up from the earth from the ancient room with all our little suitcases time to clamber what could we were listed by claw and again in a lifeboat so i mean well the ship wasn't thinking so we had to get rifles or to get em come on you'd get back down below decks where why were similar saif we're going wished to london why so that was it what who were these people well at mostly indians at the one english that when english they i mean i don't know but the engineer whether he wished he wasn't covering up a i don't know what he was doing to know how to andrey buddy well who did when you hit you don't quite know it is a mean dishonor you the there's a list inasmuch as all you could see the cargo just like guns and living just sliding into the magistrate is clear water you could secrecy the stuff just floated so make it clear that hold her into holly a a covert left the convoy and escorted us good guns were usually we lycia too much we couldn't use anything but we're one attack on coach are always state and i'm wondering whether that coast long and why mines but why we might all jews having got in when listed we tied up alongside in algiers and uh the army was now established ashore and i would come in to discharge to ship you know and as our direction everything just shot well we got friendly with him and and yknow uh oh i wish to feed him because i've come a born we had plenty of food aboard and um on this particular morning what was old show us how is boring and curse a hazard admission of a hater who said what he got he got stopped at the gates on a way out last night and he has taught him pair of pants on obviously is as sorter flogged on our shores bows out on our i mean we had nephew stores or we'd have all that talk thing that by everything that poor dear yeah and what of where he sat me why you when the torpedo here what was your first reaction for panic really what what do you do it and the knowledge is deafening and i got to right and i mean it may take a list well i mean i mean it what's your style huh you list if he was poured in it how hold obviously and i'm going out so uh i mean now i have to say do as there's less but you could still it's lot woven of a hill to go at night when we still float very lucky to be we were lucky we know what we're lucky where i mean haven't got in our when i was telling the story there well fondly i haven't the army ledge discharges cargo why then labor gotta gotta in another part of the harbour and uh i mean most offers us a lavish or we went ashore and everything well then we had a bombing right and harm and um uh i think i'd i think i think the ship we are he resigned as well and i think that's what i've laughed at the idea of her sussex i'm not sure but i think numbers i use a cruiser anyway and while i missed her and hit us and we got hit a sign executives sign as she just broke up inaba she's just sunk in arm and nobody was good i made a lovers was a shore but armenia with a commotion we got back and i think that the skipper's told the story i think he was even a shower suffering i don't know what happened they have but anyway nobody was killed it's interesting because yknow yeah you've had a a pretty inoffensive war really are granted to you've got to to bolt even so peter had been bombed how were you reacting to real war situations now you remember a well i think you're comes automatic i think you're comes over mating alvin we wish since other ships so i mean at sea suddenly you to say is destroyed i mean we was in convoy you see it just draw put of i think i used to put a black flag up and had come through the convoy for just dropped depth charges and i mean i am one of well remember one convoy a ship broke down with broke all my lord of all ships were some of the old ships are the message very old and it broke down and i had to take into view but i know the whole ship would your ship would take briny because of traffic live under water soda water you know when i dropped here had you seen yeah ship's been some karate by that when a guy now we were on our actually when i was on on on the cambrian coast at one ship we were we've picked up in convoy on ship a have gone as some one of them coasters goes son and were you heard a bang on the japanese are ship had gone so why you owe me you just blood on me to or don't have to situate there was usually a ship a tug slow astern of the convoy to pick up percival of his subject to pick up survivors yeah what war is a gun there's course and why did you go on that well is to step out of shame and gonna which i was you've got a i don't know what a little bit by increasing wages and uh i mean national because on coastal ships and the other two were saved my gun as it was in charge of the office of it of the country so for last and you gotta rising wages and this was done at least and i mean any and you had to go to sea so far off a little story there on on a little costa i know biddy the skipper and to pass you on on honest course to pass for a gunner uh and you had to fire a twelve pounder gun a different positions on the gun and uh the procedure if if the gun failed to far irena corn to the annual you jest put into safety and and undo leave it but the the blow in charge of it he just we hope the breach took it out as sight okay the guns are now i want me he given older and so it overboard and then carried on for the lesson but l mean that that was a a quarter boat but i mean if if that gum was couldn't use it we can pass why is as say so that's how it went on anyone past it i mean another woman i i had to go in one of these whether the bloke in charge of sin let her got these rockets rakish each side of which they fire on you as a alone in a tried your sit beside beside a wobbler one side and the blow in charge here and a fire these rockets well the poor blow it do you know where there was blood coming down his nose i mean when night go off his unbelievable because they're on ships on on life non worshipped with that i'd be on a crucial whatever the noise so we had to pass ahead this is done it some way on his south east coast the holy pull rarer wherever we went yeah but the next shit you did was a malay imprint emmeline french and that was an unusual cargo just sammy about where you in convoy with that cargo i'm lying prince hang on what i've got to think on that one should money oh yes we are not very unusual cargo here why we loaded this is money was print pendulous in in britain and we had to tight decide to alexandria in egypt and so were having got over there then whenever she been just shah's we'll have to have rolled from his heart and stand on guard of willow according to quite a bit of money past ages there always pay as soon yeah you went through the serious canal oh was allowed whoa i remember one thing i mean i told you that they ought to learn they are of hedgerows him i went as an anxious uh milan prisoners caught a big ships used a twin screw shall we were commodore ship going through the mediterranean so we had a commodore waugh so i'm i'm off in all quarters and one of the ship one of the boys down down below decks to say my a what will you that they say from the bridge i tell me as a gunner down there can cut hair the conference all commodore was a hair cut where would you come up with a haircut well i mean they just blankly beside my they say so i i mean i did you are well remember joam joam blow as she i'm just an ordinary right in a blame led the way we had a boat for we had army crew come over here cut done amiss while i i give him a hair cut but i'll give him a american here cause you understand me he had a tuft which he didn't know yet down he went back to his mess and combat what the hell you thing to do it i sir why sony a joke at come on and putting right well anyway went out by their names are skipper the commodore we rode on a boat and menstruation lovely die and desert me with my hand clippers given the recall my door here got so just leave me alone the lower decks really so um having done a ship well i haven't got any money only a moment forgotten but see me alex i'll get money for it's where the so that was a shall we robin alex well i knew he'd be called to shore so our observation soured on deck looking up and he he i seem sort to go over to the skipper on either knows what he can my color bulger similar then a went ashore yeah that was the end of him uh was in ice oh god pleasant yeah what he's gonna here to get into pancha wasn't my analysts say and on the table was an interesting ship it was a hospital why does she is a very apt all ship i'll shit but um i mean we're or had a were already english doctors nurses table so i mean we didn't have much to do or do with him roughly i mean pop pop into my different paltry winter we have to do sabotage wash ah ah well remember ah one plate as usual calcutta uh here are your short of all round and that that they fell matter indian bloke there to make sure the river chaps are coming aboard and i am hurting me we showed one blow is it henry uncle johnny him say cock so how are you i don't know how to be ready venereal disease i don't know but then he might be a cup of tea and things like that they're so friendly yeah yeah did you visit different experience at this point of the war remain it is more enjoyable .period ah well you know i mean to what the war was germany is over but uh ah a dish periods of rain the chaps and i don't mean a thing for singapore as my weber bountiful said such well i mean that they we spent quite a better time haven't got up to calcutta by this time to the british it free reed conquered rangoon aren't you on the bone aside and we would going down the ganges over to rangoon with indian troops leave them there coming back more truth and that's what will you do it for quite a wall then fondly the convoy left rangoon and because we had to beg boys was as in mike and facing a bullwhip was the idea so going down that coast ah august friendly with the sparks and he had kept me reformed by simple we just had a phone call comes or not found obey message comes through of the yanks are just dropped two atomic bomb and the japs are powerless surrendered so whatever the good news i because i'm ready to go to go in a singapore it was worth it would be well armed so we don't really i wish i minesweepers ahead of us and we just smiled in singapore and the appeared a hospital ship we was tied up we're tied up alongside and uh because the prisoners are more flocked to the dogs and uh well we had food borders an awfully nature you so worrying over give me something stay stopped all that we were lying because i had to be bought back to life again yknow normal die they couldn't say they couldn't eat as sam ledgers body shopping what do they live well thin poverty then but i stopped already were you shocked when he's well while i was in a state they were horrible and uh what are spent years in photographs of them yeah as you to remember how you thought when he saw things there well i don't think you you've got used to everything you your except you i'll bring the uh why was quite interested with i don't know what officer we had there we had a ship there her anchored to the other side huh i think was gonna take the japanese surrenders something i'm not sure who it was but uh guide i knew it was time but i've forgotten years had gone by many many moons are the envoy and yeah can i ask i like you reflect on the war on air well well i'm glad to be alive and i yknow i am pleased i civil host a lot of a ledge last there was a pause yeah i sorry i'm stammering the motion so proud to have daniel burton who earlier yeah there
