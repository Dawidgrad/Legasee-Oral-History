WHERE THE BATTLE WAS GOING ON AND I WAS PUT THEY SENT ME IN THE DOCKYARD TO DO A JOB WHILE UNTIL THE SHIP COME UP YOU SEE AND I WAS IN THAT SUBMARINE BUT I HAD TO GO IN THAT SUBMARINE WHICH WAS IN DRY DOCK THAT HAD FILLED THE GERMANS AND THE SPANIARDS WHEN THEY PUT THAT DEAD BODY OVER IN THE CHANNEL BETWEEN THEM DO YOU REMEMBER IT WELL THEY FOOLED THE GERMANS THAT IT WAS A GERMAN THAT WAS THEY ACTUALLY PUT A BODY THEY GOT A DEAD MAN'S BODY A GENUINE DEAD MAN'S BODY FROM UP NORTH AND THEY PUT IT INTO THIS SUBMARINE AND THEY ACTUALLY DRESSED IT ALL UP THERE WAS A MAN TRYING TO TAKE INFORMATION TO THE SPANIARDS YOU KNOW THE COASTLINE AND THEY SUNK IT THEY TOOK THIS DEAD BODY AND BE DONE IT ALL MADE IT ALL LOOK SMART IN A UNIFORM NOT NOT SERVICE UNIFORM BUT IN CLOTHING AND AND THEY PUT A THING ON HIS ARM WITH A GREAT BIG ATTACHE CASE WITH ALL DUMMY INFORMATION WHAT WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A GERMAN SPY YOU SEE BUT YOU SHOULD IF IT COMES IT'S A FILM IT'S FANTASTIC ANYWAY THAT LITTLE SUBMARINE THAT I HAD TO GO AND WORK ON HAD JUST COME BACK FROM TAKING THE BODY AND FLOATING IN THE BETWEEN THE SPANISH COAST LIKE IT ASHORE AND IT ADDRESSED HIM ALL UP AS ONE OF THEIR SORT AS YOU KNOW AND IT ALL WORKED WHAT WAS IT LIKE GOING TO THE SAVAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN YOU WERE YOU KNOW YOUR FIRST PROPER DRAFT DO YOU REMEMBER WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT WERE SHE WAS DOWN ON THE BATTLEFRONT AND SHE WAS CALLED AWAY BECAUSE SHE WAS NEEDED FOR THIS AND WE WERE DONE TORPEDO COURSE AND WE WERE HAVING TO WORK IN THE DOCKYARD IN THE DAYTIME AND THEN VITTLES IN THE IN THE CANTEEN AT NIGHT AND ANYWAY WE GOT PIPE FOR AND WE BOTH GOT TOLD TO GET A KIT ALREADY AND TAKE HER IN THE DOCKYARD AND THE SAVAGE CAME IN FROM BEING DOWN YOU KNOW ON THE BANK THEY WERE FIGHT HIM AND SHE'D BEEN PULLED RIGHT UP AND THEY WERE LOADING HER UP WITH STUFF AND ALONGSIDE AND WE GOT CALLED AND PUT ABOARD HER AND WE WERE THAT'S AS QUICK AS THAT BUT I'LL TELL YOU THE BLOKE THAT WAS WITH ME HE DIED NOT ABOVE THREE WEEKS AGO AND WE BOTH TOGETHER YOU SEE WE BOTH TOOK THE COURSE TOGETHER AND EVERYTHING AND WE STUCK TOGETHER AND WE BOTH GOT PUT ONTO THE SAVAGE SHE CAME IN IN THE AFTERNOON AND PULLED ALONGSIDE AND GOT IT IT WAS MURDER THEY WERE HAVING TO DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS BECAUSE WE GOT A RACE UP WITH THIS BIG CONVOY WAS COMING FROM CANADA ALREADY THERE WAS LOADS UP IN NORTH SCOTLAND WAITING FOR THE CONVOY TO MOVE AND THIS IS HOW WE KNEW IT ANYWAY THE POINT FOR US TO AND WE WENT ON TO THE ER WINDOW WHERE THEY TELL YOU WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND THEY SENT US STRAIGHT TO THE SAVAGE IN THE DOCKYARD AND WHAT SAVAGE WAS HAVING TO DO WAS TAKE ON AMMUNITION AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND IT WAS POURING A BLOODY RAIN THAT NIGHT IT ROCKETED DOWN AND WE HAD TO GO DOWN FURTHER DOWN THE COAST BECAUSE THIS WE JOINED IT YOU SEE ONCE WE WENT ON WE WERE THERE FOREVER YOU SEE WE'D BEEN DRAFTED TO HER WHICH WAS ALRIGHT BUT WE WENT DOWN TO WHEN IT GOT DARK I WENT DOWN TO THE AMMUNITION PLACE WHICH WAS A LONG WAY DOWN THE WATER FROM US IT WAS POCKETING DOWN AND GOD BLONDE HAD AMMUNITION SHIP IN THE DARK AND YOU WENT ALONG THESE BODY PIPE NOT PIPES BOARDS AND THEY WERE SPRINGING UP AND DOWN CARRYING STUFF OUT IT POUR THE RAIN PITCH BLACK AND THE SHIP WAS SHIPPING WATER IT WAS SO RAINING SO HARD WHEN WE WE WERE ALL CARRYING STUFF UP ALONG THE LANDING YOU KNOW TO FILL HER UP WITH AMMUNITION AND THAT AND WE SAILED FROM THERE AT MIDNIGHT THROUGH THE BETWEEN IRELAND AND THAT TO JOIN THIS BIG CONVOY I KNEW YOU NEVER SEE IT RAIN LIKE IT GOD ALMIGHTY AND I WAS A LOOKOUT HE MIGHT MAKE IT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE AND THE LOOK OUT IT WAS BLOODY SOAKED TO THE SKIN PITCH BLACK OF COURSE WE HAD TO PUT ALL NEW AMMUNITION ON AND OR WE COULD SAIL FROM THERE BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AMMUNITION ONE DOWN THERE ANYWAY WE GOT UP IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING WE REACHED LIVERPOOL IN THAT AREA AND THEN IT STARTED LIGHTING UP A BIT BUT NEVER LEFT OFF DRIVING RAIN AND WE WENT RIGHT THE WAY UP TO THE NORTH WHERE WE GOT TO PICK THIS CONVOY UP AND THEY WERE ALL MORE OR LESS READY TO SAIL IT WAS THE BIGGEST CONVOY OF THE WAR AND EVERY TYPE OF SHIP WAS THERE AND OF COURSE WE JOINED HER I MEAN I'D NEVER BEEN THE BLOODY SEA YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE BECAUSE WE HADN'T BEEN TRAINED FOR IT IT WAS TOO QUICK BUT ANYWAY WE MANAGED MY MATE THE FIRST THING WERE YOU WERE ALL MIXED UP BECAUSE THE SHIP WAS SHIPPING WATER ALL THE WAY UP AND I WENT DOWN INTO THE FRONT OF THE SHIP AND IT WAS HALF FULL OF BLOODY WATER AND IT KEPT SWINGING FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER IT WAS SHIPPING IT OVER THE TOP YOU SEE IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST STORMS OF THE WAR RUNNING UP THAT COAST AND ER BUT ANYWAY I I DON'T MIND ADMITTING IT I FELT SO BLOODY SICK GOING UP TO RUSSIA I WASN'T TOO BAD GOING UP THROUGH THE CHANNEL AS I SAID BUT WHEN WE ACTUALLY GOT GOING I THOUGHT I BLAME I GOT BILLETED THEY HADN'T GOT ROOM FOR US DOWN IN THE MAIN PLACE AND I THOUGHT WELL I FELT AS SICK AS A DOG SO I CLEARED MYSELF WENT UP AND THEY GOT THE AFTER GUN TURRET TURNED FORWARD LOOKING FORWARD SO THAT IT WAS OPEN TO THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING ON THE BACK OF THE GUN SHIELD AND IT HAD CURTAINS HEAVY CURTAINS THAT WOULD GO OVER BECAUSE THERE WAS NO DOORS OR NOTHING THAT WAS BEHIND AND I SLEPT THERE ALL NIGHT I DID THE REST OF THE NIGHT OF COURSE I DID FEEL ILL AND MY MATE HE WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WENT BUT I WAS NEVER SICK AGAIN I WASN'T SICK THEN I FELT SICK BUT I WAS NEVER LIKE IT AGAIN BUT I'D ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD SWIMMER AND THINK YOU KNOW AND DIVER I GOT AT DIVING BUT SO WHY THAT SHOULD UPSET ME LIKE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW BUT I STOPPED UP THERE UNTIL WE GOT TWO DAYS AWAY FROM LIKE YOU MIGHT SAY AND I NEVER LOOKED BACK THE SAVAGE WAS A ONE OFF SHIP SHE WASN'T GOT HER DEPTH UNDER WATER LIKE THE OLD UP AND DOWN ENGINE ONES SHE HAD ELECTRIC TURBINES OF STEAM TURBINES MADE ALL THE ELECTRIC BUT SHE DIDN'T DRAW HALF AS MUCH UNDER THE WATER AS AN ORDINARY DESTROYER OR AN ORDINARY SLOOP WHICH WAS PROVED ON THE LAST DAY OF THE WAR OR THE CONVOY AND WE WERE ALL WAITING AROUND OUTSIDE TO GO THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN GAP TO INTO THE RUSSIAN END AND A U BOAT WAS WAITING FOR US AND WE WERE ALL THERE AND THE CONVOY WAS COMING IN IT ON TO TELL YOU SOMETIMES CONVOY WAS COMING IN AND SPREADING ABOUT BUT THE GERMANS WERE WAITING UNDERNEATH THE CLIFF BOTTOMS AND YOU COULD ONLY GO INTO THE DOCKYARD THROUGH AN ENTRANCE NOT MUCH WIDER THAN THAT WITH TWO GREAT PILLARS OF COASTLINE SO YOU HAD TO GO ONE AT A TIME AND THE BIG LIBERTY SHIPS USED TO SQUEEZE THROUGH IT ANYWAY THIS WAS THE LAST CONVOY OF THE WAR AND WE WERE HANGING ABOUT THERE WAS AS THE SHIPS THAT WERE COMING IN WITH STUFF TO TAKE IN AND THE U BOAT WAS LAYING UNDER THE ROCKS AND OPPOSITE US IT WAS SNOWING IN THE MORNING WHEN WE TOOK UP OUR POSITION TO AS THEY COME IN CASE THEY GOT LIBERTY SHIPS WITH THEM YOU KNOW WITH RAILWAY ENGINES ON THEM AND THAT FROM AMERICA AND THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENED ONE OF THEM GOT A TORPEDO IT WENT TO GO THROUGH THE OPENING INTO THE HARBOUR WHERE YOU GO FURTHER TO IT NOBODY COULD GET THROUGH IT BECAUSE THE SHIP BROKE IN HALF AND SUNK IN THE GATEWAY WE CALLED IT A GATEWAY COURSE THAT'S CHAOS THEN BECAUSE THE REST OF THE PILLAR OF AIR PORTILLO AND THE PEOPLE WE COPIED TO BRING UP WERE COMING INTO THIS BIG OPENING WHERE WE WERE ALL WAITING FOR THE OTHERS TO GO IN AND WE WERE ALL READY FOR EVERYTHING I ME AND MY MATE WERE PUT DOWN BELOW TO PUSH THE WHAT'S NAME DEPTH CHARGES UP OR COME ON AND THEN THEY WERE PULLING THEM READY TO GO HEARD WE HEARD A TORPEDO COMING SO I DIDN'T BUT THE OTHERS ON DECK DID THEY COULD HEAR IT COMING BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WERE AND IT WENT UNDER THE SAVAGE AND IT THE BRAND NEW SHIP JUST AS FAR AWAY AS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD AND EVERYBODY WAS PRACTICALLY KILLED ON IT IT SUNK LIKE THAT BRAND NEW AND WHAT DIDN'T IT HIT THE SAVAGE SHALLOW DRAFT SHALLOW DRAFT YEAH SHE HAD SHE HAD FLAT ENGINES THAT WERE DRIVEN BY SHAFTS THAT WAY KNOCKED OUT THE BOTTOM AND THEY DROVE THESE TWO GENERATORS I HAD TO GO DOWN ONE OF MY JOBS I USED TO GO DOWN EVERY MORNING AND CHECK ALL THE THINGS THAT COULD HAVE STOPPED IT AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT THAT WAS ONE OF MY JOBS YOU THINK AND I USED TO STAND THERE AND WATCH THIS BECAUSE WHAT THEY WERE THERE 'S NO PROPELLERS AS THEY WERE ON THE BIGGER SHIPS WHICH WERE RIGHT LOW DOWN WEREN'T THEY AND WE WERE THERE AND IT WAS ONLY DRAWING HALF AS MUCH WATER AS ONE OF THEM AND THAT TORPEDO WENT UNDER US AND I HIT THE OTHER SHIP THE OTHER SIDE AND WE PICKED SOME OF THE MEN UP SIX WE BE BURIED ONE BEFORE WE WENT IN A DARK WE WERE FIGHTING UNTIL DARK OUT THERE ALL THE REST OF THE SHIPS AND YOU SEE WE COULDN'T THIS LIBERTY SHIP THEY HIT IT WITH A TORPEDO AND IT BLOCKED THE ENTRANCE YOU SEE THEN IT WENT DOWN IN THE ENTRANCE AND HOW DID YOU GET RID OF THAT DO YOU REMEMBER WELL I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT WAS UP TO THE RUSSIANS TO DO THEIR OWN WORK ON THAT SO WE WERE FIGHTING UNTIL DARK THAT NIGHT AND IT WAS SNOWING AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING WHEN WE STARTED AND UNTIL IT GOT DARK AND IN FACT WE BURIED ONE CHAP IT WAS QUITE DUSK GETTING DARK AND WE BURIED HIM AND THEN WE HAD TO GO RIGHT UP NORTH FURTHER TO COME IN ANOTHER WAY FROM THE NORTH AND DOWN INSIDE THE WATER BECAUSE WE COULDN'T GET IN YOU SEE IT IT WAS TERRIBLE IT WAS THE LAST CONVOY THE WAR AND WHEN WE CAME OUT THEY'D OPENED THAT UP THE RUSSIANS IN ME IT WAS CHRISTMAS FIRST WE HAD CHRISTMAS DAY THERE AND WE WERE THERE FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AND WHEN WE COME OUT WE COULD COME OUT THAT WAY WE CAME OUT AT MIDNIGHT TWO OF US AND WE HAD TO GO NORTH RUN UP THE COAST LINE AND THE OTHER ONE WENT NO WE WENT SOUTH AND THE OTHER ONE WENT NORTH LISTENING FOR U BOATS AND WHILE WE WERE THERE WE WERE DROPPING THE CONVOY WAS READY TO COME OUT THAT WAS COMING OUT EMPTIES ALL READY TO COME OUT AND WE WERE SENT EACH WAY US AND THE OTHER ONE TO KEEP ANYTHING DOWN YOU SEE AND TRY AND FIND IF ANYTHING WAS THERE WHEN WE WERE DOING THE CONVOY CAME OUT IN THE PITCH BLACK AND BY THE TIME IT GOT LIGHT IN THE MORNING THEY WERE WELL AWAY FROM WHERE WE WERE SO WE HAD TO SCRATCH UP AND CATCH HER UP YOU SEE WHICH WE DID AND SHE BECAME HOME ALRIGHT WE NEVER HAD NO PROBLEMS AFTER THE CONVOYS OF THE ARCTIC THEN I MEAN YOU DIDN'T STAY ON A SAVAGE VERY LONG DID YOU WELL I STAYED ON THE SAVAGE UNTIL THE GERMAN SURRENDER AND WE CAME BACK DOWN TO CHATHAM CHATHAM BARRACKS AND THE DOCKYARD AND I WAS SENT FOR BECAUSE YOU SEE I WAS A VOLUNTEER I JOINED UNDER AGE HENCE IT MADE ME A VOLUNTEER NOT A CONSCRIPTED MAN WE CAME DOWN TO THE CHATHAM DOCKYARD I GOT SENT TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY EDITED YOU IN AND HELP AND I HAD TO PACK MY KIT AND THE NEXT MORNING I WAS PUT ON A TRAIN WITH HUNDREDS MORE IN THE DOCKYARD LOCKED IN WITH KEYS AND THEY TAKE THEM OUT SO YOU CAN'T GET OUT AND THIS TRAIN WENT STRAIGHT OFF FLYING DOWN TO SOUTHAMPTON WE GOT OUT RUDDY GREAT LINE THERE WAITING FOR US ALL FULL OF PEOPLE GOING TO THE FAR EAST AND SHE WAS GOING TO SAIL AT HALF PAST EIGHT AND IT WAS HALF PAST SIX THEN AND YOU COULDN'T GET ON ANYWHERE FOR PEOPLE IT WAS A REALLY GREAT AMERICAN LINE I CAN'T THINK OF THEIR NAME THERE WERE TWO ON THE MAD BUT ANYWAY WE SAILED THAT NIGHT WITHIN TWO HOURS WE WERE ON THE WATER GOING OUT AND THAT TOOK US RIGHT OUT TO SAIL ON AND THAT'S WHERE WE TOOK OFF THERE I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE WENT FROM THERE BECAUSE SHE WAS LOADED TO THE TOP WE HAD TO STOP FOR ALL WE COULD GO THROUGH THE CANAL TO GET OUT TO GET OUT TO THE BOTTOM AND YOU KNOW THE TIME WE GOT THERE IT WAS PITCH BLACK AND WE WENT ON FROM THERE DOWN THE NEXT MORNING THROUGH THE CANAL BUT SHE WAS SUCH A BIG SHIP AND THE NEXT THING WE WENT RIGHT OUT TO SALON AND THAT'S WHERE THEY BUMPED US OFF WAS THERE ANY ANY DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING OF THAT TROOP SHIP NO THERE WAS NO BLOODY ROOM FOR US WE HAD TO BE ON THE TOP DECK AND IT WAS BLOWING A GALE BLOW A BLOODY GAL AND ALL OUR HAD BEEN LEFT DOWN BELOW WHERE IT WAS DUMPED AND GOT LOADS OF WOMEN ON THERE IN UNIFORM AND THAT WE HAD TO SLEEP ON THE OPEN TOP DECK OR IT WAS BLOODY FREEZING IT WAS BUT WE WENT THROUGH THE CANAL AND WENT RIGHT OUT THEN STRAIGHT OUT TO SALON AND ER THEY DUMPED US PRETTY INCREDIBLE REALLY WHEN YOU THINK THAT YOU KNOW ONE MINUTE YOU'RE IN THE EARLY ARE IN A BATTLE AND THEN A FEW DAYS LATER YOU THAT SO THAT'S HOW QUICK IT WAS THEY WERE WAITING FOR TROOPS YOU SEE AND SHE WAS FULL THAT SHIP THERE'S TWO ON THEM THEY HAD TWO OF THEM DID YOU HAVE ANY FEAR OF GOING TO THE FAR EAST NO I DIDN'T WHAT IT WAS LIKE DID I HAVEN'T MEAN I HAD ANY SLIDING FEELING WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE BUT I DIDN'T I NEVER WANTED IT YOU SEE THAT'S WHY I RUN AWAY AND JOIN THE NAVY YOUNG I WANTED THE NAVY AND WHEN THAT ALL CAME WELL I MEAN I WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD SHE WAS A NICE SHIP BUT I NEVER DONE ANY MIND SWEEPING AND SHE WAS NOT IN THE CHATHAM A SHIP YOU SEE BUT EVERYBODY ELSE WE GOT ON I GAVE A FIRE BUT THERE'S ONE BLOKE AND HE WAS IN THE SAME MESS AS ME HE USED TO SIT OPPOSITE ME AT THE TABLE AND I DON'T KNOW WHY HE TOOK A TOOK TO ME BUT ANYWAY HE FOUND OUT THAT I WAS A CHATHAM MAN AND THAT WAS WHAT I THINK STARTED IT I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE REALLY BUT EVERYBODY ELSE WE WERE LIKE BRICKS TOGETHER BUT WHERE WE USED TO GO DOWN TO SLEEP BELOW IF WE IF WE WANT DON'T GOT ANY DANGER WE USED TO OPEN THE LOWER DOWN AND YOU'RE DOWN THERE YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER MESS DECK YOU HANG YOUR HAMMOCKS DOWN THERE IF YOU CAN AND HE WAS IN THE SAME MESS WAS ME SITTING OPPOSITE ME AND HE JUST USED TO SNEER AT ME AND I NEVER HAD A BLOODY ENEMY ON THAT SHIP THEY MADE ME THE QUARTERMASTER HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT YOU SEE AND OF COURSE THAT GIVE ME A QUARTER OF RUN OF THE SHIP AND THEN THE CAPTAIN HE HAD ME OFF HIS CABIN AND HE HAD A CHAT WITH ME AND TOLD ME WHAT HE LIKED ME TO DO AND IT WAS NICE I MEAN I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE STEERAGE WHICH MEANS THAT THE OTHER CHAPS WERE UNDER ME STRAIGHT AWAY I NEVER STEER THE BLOODY SHIP BUT I HAD TO I MEAN IT AIN'T GOT A COMPASS LIKE WHERE YOU SEE THE AISLE AND GO YOU'VE GOT NUMBERS FLICKING BACKWARD AND FORWARD AND YOU ONLY READ THEM AND WE DID HAVE ONE IN THE OLD ONE WHAT ABOUT THIS SHIP THE JAPANESE SHIP YOU WERE ESCORTING TELL ME ABOUT THAT YEAH WELL THAT WAS THE BIGGEST OF THEIR CRUISE I KEPT THINKING AND DON'T ASK ME THE NAME I CAN'T TELL YOU BUT IT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE THEY HAD AT THAT HAD AND SHE HAD BEEN BOMBED AND SHE LAY IN THE HARBOUR WE USED TO GO BY HER EVERY TIME WE WENT IN AND OUT BUT WE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON THE BOTTOM BUT SHE WASN'T BUT ANYWAY IT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE OF THE JAPANESE SHIPS AND IT HAD BEEN BOMBED AND IT HAD BEEN IN SINGAPORE HARBOUR FOR QUITE SOME TIME SINCE IT WAS HIT ANYWAY IN MINOT THEY WERE MAKING IT READY TO TOW IT AND SINK IT YOU SEE AND WE GOT CHOSE TO DO IT AND WE WERE COMING ON OUR WAY HOME AS IT HAPPENED AND WE LEFT SINGAPORE WITH HER WITH THE TO WEATHER TO TALK WITH HER ACTUALLY AND SHE WAS A MASSIVE SHIP AND SHE'D BEEN EMPTIED IN EVERYTHING AND IT GOT DARK AND WE WERE COMING UP THE MALACCA STRAITS AND WE GOT TO THIS POINT WHERE SHE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN SUNK THE DEEPEST WATER BECAUSE SHE WAS THE BIGGEST ONE THEY HAD AT THE TIME AND CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS PITCH BLACK AND WE WERE ON OUR WAY COMING TO COME HOME YOU SEE IT COME TO MIDNIGHT AND TWO JAPANESE TOGS WERE TOWING HER THEY'D BEEN TOWING HE ROWED OUT ON AIR WELL AS FAR AWAY FROM US FURTHER THAN THAT THEIR BIG THERE THEY WERE FROM US BUT THEY WERE COMING UP AGAIN THE COAST LINE AND WE WERE FURTHER OUT WHERE WE COULD KEEP OUR EYE ON EVERYTHING AND AS I SAY IT GOT PITCH BLACK AND BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE POINT WHICH WE HAD A COMPASS READING WE GOT A SINKER ON THEY STARTED THE SHIP COMING UP AND LEFT HER THEY BOLTED AND LEFT THE SHIP WITH NO HEADWAY AND SHE'D COME HALFWAY UP NEARLY TO WHERE SHE POSED HAD BEEN SUNK AND I EXPECT I DON'T KNOW WHAT A CAPTAIN GOT PERMISSION TO SINK HER BUT IT WAS MIDNIGHT PITCH BLACK AND WE HAD A SEARCH LIGHT ON HER AND THEY VANISHED INTO THE BLACK AND GONE OF COURSE SHE DRIFTED WELL SHE WOULDN'T DRIFT YOU KNOW I MEAN SHE'S A MASSIVE SHIP BUT SHE WAS ONLY JUST OFF THE COAST LINE AS WE THOUGHT PITCH BLACK AND I'M STILL ON THE BLOODY WHEEL I AM OF COURSE LOOKING AT THE WHEEL AS WELL AS WE WEREN'T GOING WE WERE JUST VERY AND I SUPPOSE THE CAPTAIN GOT IN TOUCH WITH AIR PEOPLE AND THEY SAID WHAT TO DO SO WE HAD TO SEND MEN OVER WITH DEPTH CHARGES BECAUSE WE CARRIED DEPTH CHARGES AND THEY GOT TO PUT THE DEPTH CHARGES AS LOW AS POSSIBLE IN THE SHIP BECAUSE THERE WAS NOBODY ON THERE AND I MEAN IT WERE MASSIVE AND THEY GOT TO WIRE EVERYTHING UP AND ALL WE COULD DO WAS USE THEIR DEPTH CHARGES AND ER AND TRY THEM THAT'S IT THAT WAS ALL WE COULD DO WELL WE DID WE DID IT IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN WE STARTED AND WE WERE DRIFTING A SPUR AWAY PERHAPS AS THE FIRST IS FROM HER AND OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T DO MUCH REALLY BECAUSE OUR AIR MOTOR BOAT WENT OVER AND THEY TOOK I THINK THEY PUT FOUR DEPTH CHARGES IN HER IN THE MOTOR BOAT AND THAT'S ALL SHE HOLD YOU SEE CARRY AND SO THEY TOOK THEM OVER FROM OFF OF US THEY WERE OUR CREW YOU SEE DOING IT AND WHATEVER THEY'D DONE THEY WENT ABOARD THE SHIP AND THEY TOOK THESE DEPTH CHARGES AS THE CAPTAIN SAID IT'S GOT TO BE DONE AND PUT THEM RIGHT DOWN IN THE LOWER END AS THEY COULD GET TO THE SHIP I MEAN SHE WAS A BLOODY MASSIVE THING AND THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD AND FUSED EVERYTHING WOULD EXPLODE AND CAME BACK TO US AND BANG SHE DID SHE WENT DOWN AND BLEW THE BOTTOM OUT AND SHE WENT DOWN OF COURSE WE NEVER SEE HER NOW MORE BECAUSE WE LEFT HER THERE WHETHER SHE SHE WASN'T TOO FAR OFF THE COAST AND SHE WASN'T TOO FAR FROM PENANG SHIP WAS WE WERE GOING UP TOWARDS PENANG AND DID YOU SEE HER GOING DOWN THEN OH YEAH WE WATCHED HER WITH HER SEARCH LIGHT YEAH THE ONLY SPECIAL THING TO SEE YEAH WELL WE ONLY ON UNTIL WE SEE HER MORE OR LESS THE MAST WAS STICKING OUT IN THAT'S ALL BUT SHE WAS STILL GOING SHE WAS STILL GOING DOWN HE PITCHED AIR MEN PUT DEPTH CHARGES ALL THE WAY ALONG SO WHEN SHE GOT TO A CERTAIN DEPTH THAT OPENED THE DEPTH YOU KNOW THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP TO LET THE WATER IN AS YOU DO AND WE HAD TO SIT THERE UNTIL IT FILLED UP AND FIRED THESE CHARGES AND BLOODY YOU NEVER SHOUT LIKE IT IT WAS FABULOUS BUT OF COURSE YOU WANT TO LEAVE THEIR CAMERAS SO A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD MIND SWEEP YOU KNOW A STORY ABOUT WHAT YOU DO HOW YOU DO IT OH WELL THERE'S VARIOUS WAYS YOU CAN DO IT YOU CAN DO IT WITH THE WIRES OUT WITH FLOATS ON THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN PUT DEPTHS DOWN PUT THEM DOWN TO CERTAIN DEPTHS AND LEAVE THEM DOWN THERE WAITING THEM DOWN IT DEPENDS WHAT'S GOING TO BE THERE OVER THEM AND THAT WHEN YOU COME BACK BUT BASICALLY YOU ONLY DO IT TO CLEAR THE OCEAN IN THE AREA YOU'RE IN AND IF THERE'S BEEN SHIPS COLLIDING WITH THEM WE GET SUNK OUT WE'D GET SENT OUT THERE TO SWEEP IT YOU HAVE ANY NEAR MISSES WITH THE MINES WELL WE'VE HAD THEM COME UP BESIDE US YEAH HAD TIME TO BUT WHEN YOU WERE ALL JOINED TOGETHER WE WERE GREAT STRONG WARRIORS YOU WERE IN A FORMATION LIKE THAT AND EACH SIDE GOES OUT TO ANOTHER SHIP AND THEN THEY GO OUT TO ANOTHER ONE AND THEN OUT TO THE OTHER THEN YOU GOT SEVEN BUT YOU'RE THE ONE IN THE FRONT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOT PROBABLY MORE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU CAN SOUND THAN THE OTHERS SAY THEY DO THAT SORT OF THING THEY KEEP IMPROVING ON CERTAIN THINGS AND WE MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S HOW YOU SWEEP THAT SWEEP YOU'RE ALL OVER LATCH EACH OTHER AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY TIGHT YOU ACTUALLY GOT WIRES HOLDING YOU TOGETHER IN A POSITION NO NO NO IT'S ALL DONE FREE THEY BRINK THEY HAVE TO SET THERE ON EACH SIDE OF YOU AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE AND THEN VOICE OVERS FOR THE NEXT TO AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT THAT'S WHEN YOU DO THAT TYPE OF SWEEP BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS YOU CAN SWEEP AND SO WE USED TO DO SWIPES SWEEPS WITH A LONG WIRES WE HAD A GREAT BIG THING ON AIR QUARTER DECK AND IT WAS FULL OF HEAVY WIRE AND WE USED TO LET THAT OUT WITH THINGS ON THAT YOU KNOW AND CAPTAIN ON THE BRIDGE I SAY LET GO THEN YOU STOP IT WHEN HE TELLS YOU COULD AT SOME MASSIVE SACK OF WIRE ON A DRUM AND IT'S NOT HEAVY WIRE BUT YOU PUT ANYTHING ON THE END OF IT YOU SEE AND YOU COULDN'T LET IT OUT AND IT WILL EXPLODE MINES OR IT'LL FIND IT IF THERE'S ANY THERE YOU'LL KNOW WHERE YOU STAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER IF IT'S ALL DONE ON LOCK REALLY YOU CAN'T LOOK DOWN IN THE SEA BUT WE USED TO SNAG UP AND WE SNAGGED UP ON AN AIRPLANE DOWN THERE THAT HAD CRASHED AND WELL SO WE WERE TOLD IT WAS I DON'T KNOW I NEVER SEEN IT BUT I KNOW WHEN IT SNAGGED IT AND I GOT AROUND THE SHIP BUT IT WAS A PLANE BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY KNEW CAUSE WE DIDN'T STOP BUT YOU ALWAYS GOT SOMEBODY THAT MADE SOMETHING UP DIDN'T YOU YOU MENTIONED THIS ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW THIS CHATHAM AND THE POMPEY RATING WHEN YOU SAY HE MADE LIFE DIFFICULT WHAT DO YOU MEAN HOW DID THEY DO THAT WHAT WAS WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WE COME HOME TO ENGLAND AND I HAD THE MOST OF THE TIME AND BECAUSE I USED TO GO UP AND SIT WITH THEM AND THEN I'D TAKE OVER BECAUSE I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM YOU SEE SO SO THEY DIDN'T ALL HAVE A LONG THING I JUST TAKE IT YOU SEE AND HELP AND ONE NIGHT AS DOING THAT I HAD TO BE A QUARTERMASTER WHICH MEANS WHEN WE WERE AT ANCHOR I HAD TO DO A DUTY AT THE BACK OF THE SHIP WHERE WERE THEY COME IN OUT OF IT WHEN THEY GO ASHORE AND ONE THING OR ANOTHER AND ALL THE LOG BOOKS THERE AND EVERYTHING AND I WAS ON DUTY THERE DOING MINE WE WERE ALMOST COMING HOME AT THIS POINT AND I GOT A TERRIBLE THROAT AND COLD AND IT WAS POURING THE RAIN AND I HAD TO TAKE THE NIGHT WATCH AND I THOUGHT WELL I GOT REALLY COLD AND I HADN'T TOOK ME OILSKINS OUT OF MY LOCKER BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN THERE SINCE I PUT THEM IN BEFORE WE WENT ABROAD I MEAN YOU DIDN'T NEVER HAVE MET AND I THOUGHT GOD I'VE GOT A GOOD AND GET MY OILSKINS AND OF COURSE I'M STANDING IN AN OPENING WHERE YOU GO IN THAT SIDE AND WALK STRAIGHT OUT AND FALL OFF THE SHIP THE OTHER SIDE AND AT NIGHT TIME THE THERE'S AN OFFICER AND A CREW COME ROUND THE SHIPS AND THE THEY CHECKED FOR THAT YOU'RE BEING LOOKED AFTER AND THAT WELL AS HE WENT DOWN TO GET MY NIPPED DOWN BECAUSE I GOT THE DUTY WATCH TO GET MY OIL SKIN OUT AND I GOT A TERRIBLE COLD AND THIS CHAP SLUNG HIS HAMMOCK RIGHT ACROSS THE TOP OF THE OPENING WHERE I HAD TO WALK DOWN THE STEP UNDER TO ME AND HE'S SWINGING ABOUT IN HIS HAMMOCK AND OF COURSE IT THIS IS ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND ONE KNOWN TO ME THE BOAT COME ROUND AND SEE THAT I WASN'T THERE BUT THEY DIDN'T CATCH NOTHING BUT HE TOLD THE CAPTAIN THAT I HAD BEEN DOWN THE LOCKER AND I WAS HAVING A JOB TO GET ME ME THING OPEN BECAUSE IT ALL STUCK TOGETHER BEING OUT IN THE HEAT OF COURSE WE NEVER WORE THEM YOU SEE THERE AND THE NEXT THING HE DROPPED ME IN IT AND HE WENT AND TOLD THE OFFICER OF THE DAY THAT I WAS GONE DOWN TO SLEEP AND I'M SITTING TRYING TO GET THIS BLOODY THING OPEN CAUSE I GOT A LAZY COLD AND HE'D DONE THAT AND THE NEXT THING HE SENT FOR THE OFFICER OF THE DAY HE COME DOWN PUT ME ON A CHARGE I HAD TO MEET THE CAPTAIN AND EVERYTHING AND THE CAPTAIN DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL BUT ANYWAY HE TOLD ME TO FORGET EVERYTHING HE SAYS YOU'RE MY YOU'RE MY MAN HE SAID NEVER MIND ABOUT HIM HE SAID WE'VE HAD TROUBLE WITH HIM BEFORE I BROUGHT THE SHIP RIGHT THE WAY UP TO THE DOCKYARD DOWN SOUTH AND THE NEXT DAY I COME HOME HAD THREE DAYS LEAVE AND THEN I HAD TO GO BACK DOWN TO CHAT ME AGAIN AND THEY CROSS THE DEA MY BEEN WE'RE ALL FINISHED YOU SEE BUT THEN AND I HADN'T GOT A BLOOD THEY NEVER GIVE ME A BLOODY MY SUIT AND NOTHING SO I WENT TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THEY SAID OH YOU'RE GOING UP TO SCOTLAND THERE WAS A SHIP UP THERE YOU'RE GOING ON SO I SAID OH HOW AM I GOING TO GET HE SAID IT'S ALRIGHT TWO OTHER CHAPS COMING UP WITH YOU YOU'LL ALL BE GOING TOGETHER AND THAT WAS THAT BIG SHIP UP THERE AND BUT OF COURSE SHE WAS ONLY ON LOAN TO THE DURING THE WAR YOU SEE TO US LIKE A CANADIAN AND SHE WAS GOING TO GO HOME AND I WAS BILLETED ON OR THEY PUT US ON THERE TO SLEEP AND EVERYTHING AND FEED HER QUITE A FEW OF US AND WE SLEPT ON BOARD EVERYTHING BUT BY THE TIME THEY WANTED TO TAKE HER HOME TO CANADA THEY SENT FOR ME AND I WENT TO THE OFFICE AND I HAD A BIT OF A PROBLEM AND I HAD TO SEE THE DOCTOR AND THE BLOODY DOCTOR SAID I WASN'T FIT TO GO THEY PAID ME OFF THE DAY BEFORE IT SAILED AND I HAD TO COME OUT IN THE NAVY YEAH I GOT SOMETHING IN THE CHEST AND I HAD TO SEE THE DOCTOR AND HE SAID YOU YOU'RE NOT FIT ENOUGH HE SAID ANY MORE FOR A NAVY CHEEKY BUGGER
