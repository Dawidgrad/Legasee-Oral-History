you you just touched on some of the commissioner i just talk a bit about what you were doing during that period can you remember when i commissioned the ship well then you got you all got your various action stations and i and you're normal work station and your part of ship there was usually four parts of ship there 'd be the focal for the people who were up in the the the front end of the ship may be focal division and then there was a main top on one side and a four top on the other side that be the mid ship's part of the ship and the quarterdeck was the after end of the ship and i was in the quarterdeck so you all you all had your own part of ship as it were that's where you worked and normally had your axon stationed around there so my axon station first of all was in the transmitting station down aft the by the fifteen and below the fifteen inch turret we were down about three decks with the big hat was closed down on top of us so if the ship disappeared we'd gone as well but i what what was you what were you doing down there there well in the transmitting station they would have a range finder up on the master up in one of the positions on the mass and they would the range finder would be transmitting down a distances of targets whether it be aircraft or ships and we had like i suppose it was a transmitter to the transmitting station it was like a an old type of computer really we all followed dials and lined them up and we were in contact with the gun and a all the defeat that we put into it the the guns followed our instructions so if if you were firing a gun a four point five gun at an aircraft if we transmitted all you know the the height and the bearing and all that sort of thing or if it was on a surface target you transmit to you know the range and all that sort of so really it it was a type of computer i suppose if you like and then you you that that's where you close up at your action stations and then you either ended up in two watches port and starboard or if if you were in cruising stations you you would be ignorably in three watches where you had a red white and a and a green watch red white and blue sorry red white and blue watch and the you'd be four on and and an eight off or sometimes if you were on more of an action routine you could be four on and four off so little you know it is pretty strenuous it all depends where you were and what the danger was you know or from what were they but you and dining in a bugle would go and you'd be no close up at axon station you might be there all night you might be there all day but it all depends where the ship was and what what the danger was as it light down there when the fifteen pounds ago or you could hear him thumping away all the time cause the one the white heard was quite close to us really and i so that every time they fired i mean there was a ton projectile every on weighed a ton and they had to be loaded so we we had their six fifteen inch guns so if you fired a broadside that was you know say twelve ton at a time going out and the so they're pretty so and when your admonition ship were caught they they all had to be come on board one at a time those projectiles cause they did wave just about a ton and went down into the shell room and he and then the the cordite went in the next room which would be the magazine so you had the shells in one room and the code in another room so if that got hit in action you could say cheerio as you were on your way
