this was different as churchill described the worst journey in the world and it was pretty terrific not on occasions the ship could get in the bitterly cold conditions a covered with ice over the guns the deck and no reset which meant you had to chip it all off otherwise you were vulnerable and if it was not the icy conditions it was still bitterly cold but we ran into gale force winds and mountainous seas the sort that would take you the crest to the crest of a wave twenty thirty feet in the air and then drop me down into the trough and as you were going down a judderan shuddering and the pole ship would be shaking and then you become completely awash with a with the wave and you wondered whether or not you'd stay afloat did you add and sometimes it was so the conditions were so bad that i'm we could go off watch and go back to our aft after best deck and find it a wash with three or four inches of water the plates having sprung some of its ribbit and there was only one way to get rid of it and that was to put the water in the buckets and a hand it in a chain and pass it up the ladder through the hatch way and throw it over the side ramis it very very in and how very helpful having just come off watch when all you wanted to take sleep if you could you now i mean what you know the the the conditions the weather conditions are one thing obviously another big problem with the arts it was you either had you boats on you or you miss alias you don't remember any other very much as indeed we certainly the eu boats of times we did get what we call a ping on the aztec and i then you start or pursuing them and of times dropping depth charges but in our experience and we never actually encountered one on the surface we seemed to do this one neighbor under an underwater whether or not we scored any success it's hard to know because sometimes there was oil but the whether they were just releasing it was the road samaras you know what was your what was his duty on these russian convoys just talk about strategy and its positioning et cetera well we go because of the leek a dad get up to thirty two knots and therefore we were of times covering the perimeter guarding the other cruisers aircraft carriers or battleships if they were so that we were more or less scouting as it were and a viewing the the horizon to make sure the car lot of my job was on lookouts one making sure there was some no enemy aircraft enemy shipping or you boats all for that matter in the aircraft so this was our our role lily did you did you get ashore in the pollyanna lemons certainly in the in pollyanna in a year remember what it was like a bit desolate a we did manage to play football on some icy pitch there button there wasn't really much to recall the only people that would likely to speak to you would be er young children and though some of them could speak english some english but they seemed to be trained to ask about the radar to find out if the what they could about the radar course we were warned about this really what the the cause they didn't have it apparently
