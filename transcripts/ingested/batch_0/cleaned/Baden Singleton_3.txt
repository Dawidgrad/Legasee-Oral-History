the war had claimed a lot especially after the invasion of sicily before that it was a bit hairy we used to sweep through between sicily and malta at night time you know and get through the other side same coming back when you got a contact what happened aboard normally it was flashed to the flotilla leader who then either you know sent one of the quicker boats or he would disappear but he didn't usually leave station he was the one in charge you just had to watch on you know the seaman asdics radar skipper on the bridge signalmen you know and just the watch but it didn't take long because you didn't undress soon as that went you were out you got so tired four on four off because i maybe had a couple hours to go after the dogs before i'm on watch i've just laid my gasmask down on the gun platform and i've just slept there you could sleep anywhere you were so tired i've slept standing up on the bridge leaning on the bridge with my glasses up to me eyes and legs gone i didn't know i was going to sleep you know it wasn't intentional but i have i've fell asleep i mean you couldn't carry a lot of fresh food bread we had for two maybe three days maximum we would run out of fresh veg and stuff so we'd finish up with tins tinned food eggs seemed to last longer than most but flour the cook made bread he would make bread now have you ever eaten cheesecake that's what our bread looked like because the flour was full of weevils and you'd just ignore it actually and yorkshire pudding on your plate you learnt don't turn it over never turn it over because the weevils have all gone to the bottom and we eat you do we eat we didn't have all we had was the dome underneath the asdics sweep that was our sweep we were looking for subs you know so that they didn't get as for war went on it was left to the italians and the italians aren't very brave i don't know whether i'm allowed to say this they're not fighters you could tell that through the war they did change sides to who they thought was winning you see and i think this is why we got away with it when i arrived out there they'd sort of more or less given up so that we didn't have a great deal of trouble one of our points were the jerry had an airbase there so once again we used to go through there at night they would know we're there but it's no use them trying you know with aircraft at night soon as you left alexandria and joined the convoy you would then be sweeping throughout oh yes and if you got a contact then the usual drill would be for you to pass that information to the corvettes or other vessels that were more capable with the speed so really your depth charges were really a last resort more or less they were there if we could drop deep enough to get out of the way yes i mean maximum we're talking maximum twelve knots isn't very fast when those things were going to go off we did we did get going back with a small convoy we did get a ping you see and so we're on our own i forget what we're escorting it was just us and he dropped this pattern and still there and one he first drop was shallow too shallow and we bent the plate didn't we we had the pumps working all the time the thing was it wasn't a sub anyway the sub lieutenant hadn't altered the charge and this was a wreck i mean anyone's choices really it was just a fact he hadn't made the charts up if it was metal a wreck normally they chart it you see so we had the charts of them get the charts together but that particular time it wasn't so automatically thought it was a sub sitting there it wasn't moving so we had a go but all in the bottom your personnel experiences were generally in the immediate aftermath of the pedestal convoy yeah as i say it did quieten down a lot we got there when it was quieter because malta because malta was relieved there was no need to stop convoys you see what i mean you could go they was about and they thought let's have a go at that they would of done but there was no point to it there was no need but we still had to escort and you were on the wolborough in june forty four when the invasion of europe took place what did you hear about that did that in anyway change very little very little it was a long way away you know we didn't get much news we did get the news that the war had finished it came over the radio operator and of course ships company knew it before the skipper most action i saw was on romeo that was the action i saw
