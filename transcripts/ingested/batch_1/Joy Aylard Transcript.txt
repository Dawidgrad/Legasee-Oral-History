my name is joy i was originally joyce baker my husband didn't like the name joyce so i was always joy since we were married and i was at school in ilford at the age of fourteenth i was evacuated down to south wales actually first of all we went to ipswich and we were there for six months until the german's invaded the low countries and then we went on one train from ipswich right down to aberdare and i was then there for um until july nineteen um forty one when i left school at sixteen and came home my parents wouldn't let me stay at school at sixteen so i came home and uh what was it like being evacuated was it an adventure or was it terrifying well i wanted to go i wanted to be with my school with all my friends and i was very i was very lucky i was with a very nice family the mother had died when her daughter was born the daughter was almost our age i had a friend with me and er i was very well looked after and i was very happy there no question about it very happy there and i was still in touch with them until they i actually had a letter from the granddaughter actually for christmas the person that i knew then is no longer really with it but i kept in touch until now really and um were when you say you were evacuated where were you evacuated from where was your home town ilford in essex so and uh i went with the school all the school friends and uh i can remember we had to walk from the school down to the station and all our parents were on the other side of the road watching us go because we went with the school not with our families so bit hard for our parents to see us go but um there you are yes and were there any exciting moments that you recall from your being an evacuee any stand out memories that you want to share no just that i was very happy there no question that it was a very happy time um i can remember the um castle the family were with in the air force and one of them while i was there was actually was killed i think it was a training fight that was very upsetting but i didn't really know him that well but otherwise it was just very pleasant happy time i think if there had been one thing as a teenager that you miss was i couldn't go to the pantry and pinch a biscuit because it wasn't my pantry but um i was very well looked after and i was very very happy there i was studying then for my what was then school certificate and um it was really lovely and when you when you returned to london then you know you've come back you were a sixteen year old girl and obviously london and you'll have you'll have seen a change did you feel slightly different did you feel a different person yes i missed the mountains although south wales isn't mountainous there are hills all around low high hills i really missed the mountains and i missed the i suddenly found my family had a london accent because i was used to the welsh one that was the odd thing but um and of course it was the time of the blackout i was at um a local college doing a secretarial course for a year then i was working in london at um what was then brothers i was studying in the evening to take um the first year of a degree in economics and i become i'd be in london for three nights until didn't get home three nights ten o'clock and one night eight o'clock coming home in the dark in the late evening was you just get used to it though you know used to go on the trolley bus and uh did you were there any air raids oh yes when we got home there were definitely air well say we had one my father was um badly injured in the first world war so could never bend his leg so we couldn't have a shelter we were sitting in the um our back room um while the air air raid went on and uh we weren't hit but a landmine fell nearby and all the windows went out but um we weren't injured so that all got put right and uh you know you just carry on and i then went back to wales of course this was in easter forty one and uh that was the blitz that was the blitz yes but there that was just really a uh the blitz ended with mostly in uh late nineteen forty early forty one this was almost the last tail of it then of course after that we had doodlebugs you know the flying bombs and then they um the e two s which were the um the one that you had no warning they my aunt was killed in one of those in east ham but you could can remember the doodlebugs you could hear them shut out stop and then you'd wait for the crash you know it was all part of life you know we didn't it was just your life did did you sort of start to get a sense that you wanted to do something because you saw you saw this war you felt this war why why was there a calling for the wrens well because you um you wanted to it was glamourous you wanted to go in the services and if you didn't go in the services you might end up in a factory but it was just the wrens had the you know an allure for young people and i wanted to go in the wrens rather than the ats um because they had the it was all regarded as rather super superior service the navy always the wrens were always more popular than the ats or the waf and uh as soon as i was able to at eighteen i applied to join and then in september i was actually um i went to we went for the first fortnight to mill hill to um the training for a fortnight was really just scrubbing floors and things like that and uh and then i went straight to eastcote not having a clue i went in to be a radar mechanic but when i got there there was no course available and they wanted people to be to do what was called um pembroke five and uh you just had to be i think most of us had courses that had been reasonably intelligent and then went to eastcote not knowing anything about it and then you found out you know but um we had we were quartered at eastcote in purpose built um accommodation just long cabins with bunk beds and then we went to a security post to get to where we worked and there was uh a marine on the on the gate there and then we worked these the bombes and uh we were always on um f um four shifts you know and uh i loved it i enjoyed shift work it meant when you had a change of shifts i could go to london perhaps in the morning put down a stool to go to the for a theatre and i remember i did that to go and see john gielgud in henry v was it henry the v i think so at um the new theatre and we had to leave uh before it finished it was a long play to get back to eastcote in time for night watch at eleven thirty i remember that very clearly you know having to leave before the end but um i found being near london was lovely used to go on the up on the tube and um um for the evening or have lunch and uh and uh no it was a happy time really i can't say i had a miserable time it was uh i can't remember any bad things i never minded doing night work except in the say three in the morning you'd feel a bit low and we used to used to have a little um thing of coffee called bev very very strong instant coffee it was absolutely vile it waked you up at three in the morning but um you you've just touched on on mill hill the training yes and also the i mean can you remember the sort of uh you know those early days of of what mill hill was like and what the the camaraderie was like and any any specifics of what you did there no i can remember scrubbing floors and uh we were all interviewed about what we wanted to do and i remember other people in the um one or two of them were obviously came from quite well bred families and some of them wanted to go and be um um wrens on the on the um on the shore boats you know um ferrying people out to the ships and things like that but it was only a fortnight so you didn't get very its just a vague memory of um umand then and then i mean you say you just you just went to eastcote but you surely didn't just get straight onto the bombe machines what was what do you umyes yes we did we were selected to go to what was then pembroke five which landed at eastcote we must've had a small amount of training and then we were there immediately we were operating the bombe's for eighteen months and uh well just just describe describe the work and what you were doing and what what it was you were describe the bombe and and what you were actually doing what were you physically doing what was your what was your right the bombs had i think was three rows of three rows of three drums and we had to we had a sort of a thing um quite big about the size of those windows i suppose and um we had a thing beside us with all the the bombes they were different colours and you'd be told what colour to put in and you'd put on these bombes in the rows and then you had to um turn them to the right you then had to put them all down to turn it to a particular letter and you had pluckthe back of the machine would give the menu had to pluck up a z or b six or whatever it was at the back and uh then you would start the bombe and when it stopped you had to write down the letters and you send those to your partner would be two of you and she would be there with a checking machine a bit like an enigma machine and you put on the right drums and you follow a menu pressing this and uh if it came out a certain way it was a possible um clue a possible um correct um setting and you would then that would then um teleprint it to park and then if it was the right it worked you'd get a job you'd get a message job up which meant that that had been solved you had to clear the bombe and put something else on the most tedious part was that these bombes had little you've probably seen them little brushes all um wired brushes in in layers all round the inside we had to tweeze those so you didn't get a short circuit you had to be very careful to tweeze all these wretched things they were little um not spreading around and if um if there was a problem you'd be you know if you did something wrong they would find out that you're bombe should have broken the code earlier you'd be in dead trouble but um and what did it when it when it didn't say code uh bombe up or job up job up what was the alternative what did you do then we'd then put another we'd then we were then told to put on a different um set of bombes or different letters on you know you were given a there was a a leading wren in charge of each bay the bays were named after countries there was a i know we had a bay a poland bay i remember that very clearly and then and uh and then we were given um a list of um of what colour bombes to put on and what settings to put on and then when that particular code was broken we would then put something else on you know did they tell you what what it was that you were doing yes we did we knew what we were doing the only time i heard anything was i remember somebody coming to see us at eastcote don't know who it was saying that actually one of the eastcote bombes had broken the code which enabled them to sink the i can still remember being told the had been sunk because of the work that we were doing at eastcote which was very the only time we we knew we were breaking the german code we knew that all the time but we didn't hear many successes that one time which i think was fairly unusual we were told that very good for the morale though being told that but it was just a job and you just got used to not talking about it which is why later on people ask for your memories because you hadn't talked about them or discussed them they hadn't got reinforced over time so it's very easy to get your memories wrong if you see what i mean because you just might i remember i heard my brother before he died recently that my father was upset that he never knew what i did during the war he knew i was in the wrens but that was all he never knew what i did and that upset him apparently you just you know it was just one of those things it couldn't happen now but in those days you just did not talk and how did they how did they get these the rooms that you were working was it just two of you in a one room no no you had a big room with about ten bombes i suppose something like that and you had aa bay would be called poland and you'd have and krakow and warsaw they'd be named after towns can't remember all of them because as i say you never talked about it and did you work on different bombes or were you assigned no no you were you just you know you were just told which bombe to work on and you were just told each morning what to or each afternoon each evening what you were doing that day and that was it and how how you know how well serviced were these bombes how you know did they we had we had raf to service them and that was very important um it was the only we had one officer wren um forgotten her name but um she was the only wren who was actually servicing the bombes all the other bombes all the bombes were serviced by the raf we just had to operate them and how often was that servicing did they you know i have no idea it was just done that's all it was done whenever it was needed really if anything went wrong the raf would put it right but um i remember once we had one it must have been nineteen forty four some time we had one of the bays was given over to americans we didn't they didn't come in our same same entrance as we did we didn't really meet them but they had one bay that was operated by americans and i learnt later on that they americans took their best and wrens which upset me badly but um difficult but um course it was only because the americans had had access that we found out more about it after the war because um it was tony forgotten his surname now sorry memories get very bad but somebody from bletchley park heard that the because the americans had been operating the bombes and knew all about them they had a lot of information in america that we didn't have about the bombes and they went over it was tony sail i think went over to america and got all the information because of that they were able to make a bombe in the uk otherwise you couldn't have done that because they got access to american records that they were able to do that and in terms of the the sort of the and people like that did you were you aware of no no wouldn't you were very much we just knew about what we did there was no um as i say i was only at eastcote which was literally only the bombes but when i went to bletchley park itself because in i told you in may forty five that came to a complete stop and most of the wrens had to sit there taking the bombes to bits um and then were gradually reallocated elsewhere and i was sent immediately to bletchley park to work on the japanese code but it was a very short time what i can't understand or think i probably can for the first month i was doing a doing a sort of code breaking course in english and i think maybe they were thinking ahead of the um what was then the government code and cipher school um for after the war and i was offered a job there but i got a place then to go to london school of economics so i didn't take it up but um so i did that so by the time i actually did any work on the japanese code it must have been um middle of june it was just as far as i recall paper and pencil stuff um sets of numbers i think and you did various things with them but it was such a short time that my memory's not very great on that i do remember hugh foss was in charge of the japanese section he was very tall bearded scotsman very keen on scottish dancing but um because we were at i was at east at um bletchley um i was bulleted at wavendon which was a lovely stately home which would later be home of um and johnny but when i was there it was just given over to the wrens this beautiful place with a lake and gardens and then we must have had a bus into bletchley every every day i can't remember that was not shift work that was day work and it was lovely lovely summer it was really very i used to go across to woburn sands swimming in the gravel pits you know i had a really a very happy war sounds terrible but i did do you remember any of what you were sort of hearing or seeing no no you just operated the bombes you were given these menus you had to follow instruction no no no no bletchley sorry bletchley sorry bletchley oh bletchley i remember very little about bletchley which is silly really but i was only there from uh i suppose about three months before the war ended so there was nothing muchi can't even remember what we had for our food i can remember the um there was quite we were in a hut of seven and i can remember sitting in a back room working on my own on this um code breaking course in english and then sitting in the room with hugh foss and somebody else i can see myself now sitting with these sheets doing various things but not much more that's ok and of course you wouldn't meet anybody else you it was you never sort of um because we were bulleted at wavendon you couldn't um stay around after hours you had to go back to wavendon so i had no social life at bletchley itself so i didn't really meet very many people except the people i was working with very small group i saw photographs of you playing hockey and stuff could you just what do you remember i mean you mentioned the theatre but back in eastcote what else was you know talk about the camaraderie and the fun you had there well it was just a wren about can't remember how many had to on each what i don't know and you just you just went on watch one thing i can remember i felt very sorry for our food was provided by wren stewards and i thought it must be grim for them they'd joined the wrens to be with sailors all they were lumbered with was cooking for wrens and i did hear a tale im not sure but i was told that the first officer of the whole wren set up didn't know what we were doing it was the first officer in charge of the whole lot a second officer in charge of the where we were working and then the four watch officers third officers there was a first officer in charge who i don't think knew what we were doing the second officer who was in charge of where we worked and then each watch had a third officer and of course the wren steward wouldn't have had a clue and the people at eastcote i don't think ever had a clue what we were doing even now i don't think eastcote knows much about what we did during the war it was that we had to go about a ten minute work from the eastcote station up lime grove a very long road at the end of the road was these the wren barracks i suppose you'd call them wrenery the wrenery and uh and there i think they pretty well all down now but for a long while it was used by the american navy when you were at eastcote did you do you remember or can you remember now an increased amount of activity leading up to june forty four no d day no no we just operated the bombes full stop and just tell me about these bombes how how quickly would you you know you put your bombes in how quickly are they sort of providing you with information codes well you just you start the bombes and then they would go through all these different um numbers until they got a possible combination the bombe would stop they would write down these um the three the first three letters first three numbers no first three letters and uh and what the colour bombes were and so forth and then um of course nine times out of ten they were no use and then you just carried on you just went on doing it and doing it and doing it until you got job up until you got job up or they decided that there's sometimes they would take what was off the bombe they would take they would say strip the bombes something urgent has come in and then you put in the new one so sometimes we were told to strip the bombes and redo it with something new that was more important and when you say strip the bombes you mean take all the drums out yes and when you put them in they had to be put in lined up in a certain way did they well you had these um sort of pegs you put each bombe on you ought to go to you ought to see them at bletchley park really you just put these about that size you've seen photographs of the bombes haven't you yeah yeah it's just i'm asking you to record it yes so you just put the um we had about that size and you had just picked up theyou were told to put say red yellow and green you'd pick up the red disks put them all on put them on and click them into place then you'd go round and move the dial to the right letter you were told what letters to put on and you did that with three rows of three then you would turn the switch and they would start revolving the the first lot would roll quite fast at the end of um going through that lot they would go to the next row and that would you know they'd go they'd go through the whole lot and see what if there was a possible combination a possible combination it would stop and then the the checker would put it on another machine and go through um a menu of um press this press that press the other and see if it came up in a certain way and then you would then um not email it you would i used the word just now write it down and write it down but it was sent by a teleprinter to bletchley and they would then deal with it there and you never worked on the teleprinter you just stuck on the bombes did you you were just bombes i was bombes or checkers yes we were all the we were all the same i remember there was oneand i haven't been able to find anything about it which is very annoying at one stage i was askedby then i was a leading wren and i was asked to go on a a particular um short period in another bay working on something different but i was there to be in charge of the bay i didn't actually work was a different machine and i never found out what they were doing it was something it wasn't a bombe it was quite different i can remember i remember paper tape but i can't really remember but i never found out i think occasionally they tried out different things and then they abandoned them it was only for a very short while anyway but um i can remember that i never found out what it was and how how noisy are these bombes how how noisy what sort of sound well its noisy but not desperately noisy it's just a sort of rotating bombes i don't think it had i don't think its the sort of noise that would affect your hearing i don't think i remember collette was saying in her article that it was very noisy but i don't recall it certainly wasn't very hard work you just had to put these things up i suppose being tall probably helped if you were shorter you'd have more of a problem reaching i think but um you'd just put them on turn them round took them off tweezed the um the wires and and then waited til the machine stopped and you'd do that and then you'd have to the end of the when they've gone right through a certain um routine the whole thing would stop you'd take off the off the drums put in the new lot you were told to put on put on those set those up get it going i always re i seem to recall they were all i don't ever recall it not being used i think it was always on in operation yes i think they had a um routines that they would if there was nothing urgent they would have some which they were trying you know they would keep some very old things they would keep on going still trying to break an old code but um and how big was the room with all the bombes oh it was quite big um you'd have two two rows of five bombes so it would be umit's hard to say really but it would be really two there would be a bombe there would be twice the width of this room and at least twice the length to the end of the kitchen there so ten bombes i think think it was two operators on each ten it was ten ten wrens yes and we had four shifts and what was it like work what was the sort of camaraderie in the wrenery what was it at eastcote particularly what was the camaraderie between all the wrensoh it was always no problem we just you had friends we um i can remember maybe in the first spring it was a lovely march i remember sitting sunbathing outside you know and we had these long huts where we had we had our living quarters just single story huts with double banks double bunks um you know it was perfectly you know just normal friends you'd go to london sometimes with them and you know we used to go into eastcote very often if we were on day watch we would go in the evening and have a um a waffle or something in a little cafe near east barnet near um eastcote station tube station and uh occasionally i would go down there was a sort of a forces centre near ruislip i used to go down there occasionally but mainly just went to this little cafe in um in eastcote to have the the odd meal course the food wasn't brilliant as you can imagine but umand were any did any of the wrens get kicked off out of the bays was there any bad wrens or not that i know of you never heard we wouldn't have you probably wouldn't have heard anyway i didn't know anybody who thing is you would never be moved anywhere else once you were on pembroke five that was it you couldn't be transferred to a different job that was it you couldn't you couldn't change and so most people it was a um it was a really a no promotion um place i did become a a like a leading wren then a petty officer but that was not until june forty five right at the end but mostly you were very happy just being an ordinary wren and it was quite nice being near being near london made it very pleasant when we went up there what did you do what did you do after bletchley then after the end of the war i went to lse that's where i met my husband and doing a degree in economics which i'd started um at evening school because i'd started at evening school i was able to get um a class b i think it was called um discharge i was discharged in october forty five to go to lse that was very quick others had to stay quite a bit longer one thing i just meant should have asked do you did you take any signals at the end of thedid you see the signals coming out of japan at the end of the war no no no nothing you didn't see anything like that because they had to be um you had to have translators to do all these things anyway and we we were i think the japanese section at um bletchley park was obviously very much um less important than the americans on the japanese i actually in one stage in forty four i was given the option of going to um colombo to work on the japanese to be involved in the japanese code but i was under twenty one and my parents wouldn't sign for me to go my brother who was in um he was in india in the army and he emailed he wrote to his parents saying don't you don't you dare let my sister joyce come out here so i didn't but others did go out there and uh they had a pretty good time very much with the naval officers because ordinary there were not many females out there so i think they had a pretty good time but i wasn't allowed to go that was it so what what are your reflections on the war you know seventy plus years later well we had to do it i don't think anybody doubted that we had to stop hitler so i don't think you find people saying this was an unnecessary war it happened and we had to fight it i don't recall anybody suggesting it was a like some of the more recent wars they say it shouldn't have happened it just we had to stop hitler and that was it i can remember before the war um i think almost every school was sent a couple of jewish refugees that came out of um germany in um thirty nine i didn't really get to know them each school had two i think german refugee children i didn't know that no i think that they of course they a lot of children came over and of course the kinder transport came over from from germany and of course they were school age they were about sixteen i think and we were were a um a secondary school and i think they all were allocated to to english schools i didn't know much about it but i know we had two of them in our school i think that was pretty general what do you remember of ve day then and how did you feel at oh yes remember ve day um i can't remember quite i must have gone home i think because it was obviously given leave it was may forty five i know i went up um with my family i don't know how we got must have been by trolley bus probably we went up to um we shouted um went up wherever churchill was and were yelling our heads off for churchill then we went to buckingham palace and the king and queen were on the balcony again shouting our heads off i can't remember how we got how we got home but my family were there and it was wonderful it really was a wonderful wonderful day so you actually went down to buckingham palace yes we went there course i didn't have a camera in those days i've got no photographs or anything but i was definitely there and it was you know the crowds were so big and so enthusiastic people dancing around it was it was lovely no it was very much i don't remember v day so much but ve day definitely i did actually a friend of mine from wales came up for vj day so i was still in touch with them you know although it was quite a while since i'd been living with them
