LIKED I LIKED IT I LIKE SCOTLAND STEPHNEY DIDN'T LIKE IT AIF YOU'LL READ IN HER BOOK IF YOU EVER READ IT URM SHE JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO MIX IN VERY WELL WITH SCOTTISH PEOPLE BUT I HAD GOT A SCOTTISH GRANDFATHER PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT I SO I DID SORT OF ACCEPT IT MORE AND I REALISED HATYOU KNOW THEY ARE A BIT INSULA AND THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO BE OFF FOOTING BUT THEY WERE ECAUSE THEY IT IS AN INSULA LAND UP IN THE HIGHLANDS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THE HIGHLANDS VERY WELL UM THEY ARE AA THINGTO THEMSELVES OK WELL SO JUST DO ME A FAVOR THEN JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABO ABOWHAT THE BASE WAS LIKWHAT YOUR SURROUNDING IS LIKE WHERE YOU SLEPT AND DI I OPEN IST OPEN YET AN THE WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE WORK U YE WELL I OPEND FIRST OF ALL ERM I WAS STATIONED IN WHAT WAS CALLED THE STATION HOTEL AND THE SIGNAL STATION ON THE PIER WAS ONLY A SHORT WALK AWAY AND I MET UP WITH A GIRL WHO WAS GOING TO WORK WITH ME SHE'D BEEN THERE ABOUT A WEEK WE HADN'T YET STARTED REALLY GETTING THE CONVOYS IN SO WE WERE TOLD WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THAT UM THE CONVOYS WOULD COME IN AND THEY'D BE IN ABAY AND WE HAD TO MAN THEMAN THE S MAN IT ALL THE TIME AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO ON ANY BOATS AN THAT'S ANOTHER OFTE STORY UM WE ERM HAD TO MONITOR EVERYTHING COMING IN AND OUT WE ALSO HAD TO LOOK AFTER FUNNILY ENOUGH THE ERM RAF HAD THE SUNDERLANDS AND CATALINAS UP THERE AND ERM THEY HAD A CALL SIGN WHICH CHANGED EVERY HOUR AND HALF OF THEM COULD NEVER EVER READ IT SO WE USED TO HAVE TO READ THEIR CO SIGNAL FORL THEM TO SEND THEIR PATROL BOAT OUT BUT THAT WAS UNKNOWN TO ABASE WHO NEVER HAD A CLUE WHAT WAS GOING O IT WAS A CRAZY SET UP REALLY AND M S HE SUBMARINES ON PATROL DUTY USED TO COME IN ALONGSIDE THE PIER AND WE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THEM THEIR SIGNALS EM THEY WERE THENWENT OUT ON PATROL THAT WAS MOSTLY WHAT WE WERE DOING AT THE PER SIGNAL STATION UM BUT THIS WASN'T ADEQUATE ENOUGH AND GANOVAN SIGNAL STATION WHICH WAS RIGHT ROUND THE CORNER FROM WHERE WE WERE WAS STILL MANNED BY THE MEN AND THEY ALSO HAD A NEW ASDIC CENTR OPENING UP JUST BELOW WHICH WAS RADAR AN ASDIC ERM WASE STILL DONE BY THE MEN AND THE MEN WERE GOING FROM GANOVAN AND THEY WERE GOING OVER TO LISMORE U THE WRENS WEREN'T ALLOWED UT THERE BECAUSE THERE WASOIT WAS COMPLETELY ALONE OUT THERE WAS NO NO ERE WAS NO INHABITATION SAY T WS FEW FAR A FEW SHEEP FARMERS SO THE WRENS WEREN'T ALLOWED UT IN LISMORE AND THAT'S WHERE THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN B KNOWN TO ANYBODY ERM SO THE GANAVAN SIGNAL STATION WAS GOING TO OPEN UP AND WE WERE GOING TO GO THERE WHICH MEANT VERY GREAT DIFFICULTY BECAUSE FROM THE STATION HOTEL TO GANOVAN IT WAS ABOUT A COUPLE OF THREE MILES TWO OR THREE MILES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT'S NO JOKE UM SO EVENTUALLY I WAS THERE FOR ABOPR SIGNAL STATION FOR ABOUT I WOULD SAY ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE GANOVAN WAS OPENED GANOVAN SIGNAL STATION WAS THEN OPENED UP FOR THE WRNS AND WE TOOK OVER FROM THE WREN WE HAD AN INTAKE THEN OF MORE VS WRNS SO THE WERE NOW SIX OF US INSTEAD OF FOUR AND WE TOOK OVER GANOVAN FROM THE MEN VERY VERY SPARTAN WHEN WE WERE AT THE PER SIGNAL STATION WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE MEALS TH IN THE MESS PROPER MEALS EM WHEN WE WERE ON NIGHT WATCH IT WOULD DO US NICE SANDWICHES WHEN WE MOVED FROM PER SIGNAL STATION TO THE GANOVAN SIGNAL STATION WE WERE STATIONED AT A PLACE CALLED RASEY LODGE WHICH WAS VERY TOUGH GOING ERM THEY DIDN'T LIKE WATCH KEEPERS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T HANDLE US NEARLY ALL NEARLY ALL OF THE ERM WRENNERY WAS WRITERS OR WT OPERATORS WHO WORKED PROPER WATCH OURS THEY WORKED NINETILL FIVE NOT USK WE HAD YOU KNOW WE HAD TO DO WATCH KEEPING HOURS SAME AS THE NAVY SO W IF YOU WERE LUCKY YOU GET HOT DINNER IF YOU DIDN'T YOU JUST HAD A SARDIENE SANDWICH S THE FOOD WAS PRETTY SPARSE IF YOU READ IN THE BOOK PEOPLE MY FRIENDS WHO' READ THE BOOK SAYG WHY DID YOU STAND IT BUT I SAID BUT THERE WAS A WAR AN WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY DIFFERENT WE HAD TO GO TO IT WAS OUR JOB THE MEN IT WAS IT WAS A VERY VERY SPARS SIGNAL STATION ERM I T SURE WL YOU WANT ME TO DESCRIBE IT TO YOU OS YES HE SIGNAL STATION ITSELF WAS RIGHT ON THE TOP OF GANAVAN ON JUST BY DONOLLEY HOUSE WHICH IS THE HOUSE OF THE UM LORAN LADY OF M DOODLE I THINK THEY WERE CALLED YES MC DOODL AND IT WAS ON THEIR LAND AND IT HAD BEEN BUILT AS A LOOKOUT POST I THINK ORIGINALLY FOR THE COAST GUARDS IT WAS A VERY SPARSE IT WAS ITTOO O TWO TIER PLACE YOU HAD TO REACH IT BUT TO GET TO IT IT WAS A CLIMB UP A CLIFF ALMOST A SHEER CLIFF THE ROAD WENT BELOW US AND THE SHEER CLIFF UP WHICH WE HAD TO CARRY THE OLDEST LAMP BATCHERIES WHICH WASE VERY HEAVY AND THEN EM WE HAD TO HAVE A UM A COAL FIRE A BECAUSE WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO BURN ANY CONFIDENTIAL BOOKS WHICH WE HAD IF ANYTHING IF WE HAD ANY KIND OF AN INVASION M WE HAD TO PUT THE BOOKS GOODNESS KNOWS HOW BECAUSE THEY WERE LEAD LINE THEY WERE SAFE FOM BUT WE THAT'S W WHY WE HAD THE FIRE UM WE HAD A BUNK DOWN BELOW AND A SIGNAL UP THE TOP AND WULA BALCANY ALL ROUND WE HAD A BIG TEN INCH THREE AUDIS LAMPS UM NOAN RT RT SET AND IT WAS REALLY JUST GO YOU KNOW THAT WAS IT WE JUST PUSHED IN O THE DEEP END UM AND HOW FAR COULD YOU SEE FROM THERE WHAT WAS YOUR VIS WE COULD SEE LITERALLY WHERE SHE GOT IT WE COULD SEE RIGHT FROM WE COULD SEE MULL RIGHT THE WAY DOWN TO MULL OVER TO LISMORE WELL WE HAD PERFECT VISION EM OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS COMING AND GOING WHY WAS THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT STRETCH OF COASTLINE IN TERMS OF THE CONVOYS ANYU WEL EA BECAUSE ERM IT WAS VERY SAFE ERM THE THOUGHT EM THEY COULD COME IN IT WAS IF YOU COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE MAP ERM THERE 'S A COMPLETE BAY AND TOBER MORREY THE ESCORT SHIPS ERM USUALLY PERHOUT TWO OR THREE DESTROYERS WOULD DROP THE CONVOY OFF AND GO UP TO TOBER MORRY ERM THEY WOULD GO UP UP THE SOUND OF MULL RM IF YOU COULD VISUALIZE THAT COAST LINE MULL ALMOST PROTECTS THE BAY SO ANY SHIPS PASSING HAVE TO GO ROUND BEHIND TEMULL THEY DON'T REALISE YOU KNOW RECOMING IN THAT'S ANOTHER STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK ERM ITHINK IT WAS A VERY SAFE HAVEN ERM HEY CAME IN AD ERM THEY WERE ESCORTED OFF FROM US PROBABLY DOWN TO ERM GUROCK TINK OD GO INTO THE CLYDE FOR UNLOADING OR THEY WOULD MASS UP READY TO GO OUT IT A EITHER AN EXEETA OF ARRIVAL OR AN EXPECTED TIME OF DISPATCH THEY WERE EITHER COMING OR GOING AND WHAT WAS THE MOST SHIPS YOU THINK YOU EVER SAW THEM U I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE HARBOUR WOULD BE FULL I WOULD SAY THIRTY MORE THAN THAT YES THIRTY MOST LIKELY AND OF COURSE YOU'D HAD YOU HAVE A LIST AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW YOU NO THEY MIGHT BE A STRAGGLER BUT THEY WEREN'T THEY NEVER CAME YOU KNOW YOU'D AVTHAT WAS A TERRIBLE THING YOU THIK WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ONE EM WE HAD QUITE A LOT OF LOSSES UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN THENOT IN THE BAY BUT YOU KNOW COMING AND GOING YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE YES YY BECAUSE WE HAVE WUD HAVE A LIST SENT TO US WHICH WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL LIST NEXPECTED TIME OF ARRIVAL AND YOU'D GIVE THEM ABOUT TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT THEY NEVER CAME YOU KNOW YOU JUST WONDER WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WERE ALL MANNED BY ERM MOSTLY MERCHANT MERCHANTMEN SO THEIR MORSE WASN'T VERY GOOD BUT NOW AND AGAIN YOU'D GET A A SHIP WHICH HAD A FEW AIERM UNITED STATES WHEN AMERICA CAME IN IT WAS BETTER PLANNED YOU KNOW THE LIBERTY SHIPS CAME THEN AND THEY WERE BETTER MANNED THEY WERE ERM A LITTLE BIT OVERPOWERING REALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO SHALL I SAY THIS OVER CLEVER THEY USED TO SEND MORSE AT THE RATE OF KNOTS THINKING THAT WE COULDN'T ANSWER IT N WE WOULD SEND BACK AT THE SAME RATE UM THIS IS WHY WE DIDN'T LIKE THE AMERICANS VERY MUCH I'M AFRAID UM THEY TRIED ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY TRID TO COME UUUP TO OUR SIGNAL STATION ANDWE COULDN'T HAVE THEM IN WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM IN WE HAD ONE OR TWO PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE COMING UP UM ONE SHALL I GO ON YEAH ONE NIGHT URM I COULD HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE THING AND A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND I THOUGHT YOU KNOW THIS VOICE I DIDN'T NKNW WHO IT WAS IT WAS A MAN'S VOICE WE' ALREADY HAD A WREN MURDERED IN VERARI O A VS WRN MURDERED INVERARI ON NIGHT WATCH SO WE WERE ALL VERY WARM WHIC IN WE ALL WERE TAUGHT HOW TO HANDLE A PISTOL WE HAD TO GO ON THE RANGE WHICH WAS ERM THE RAF HAD A RANGE AND WE WERE TAKEN ONTO THE RANGE BY AN INSTRUCTOR AND TAUGHT TO FIRE PISTOL AND I HAD VERY SMALL WRISK AND I WAS TAUGHT TO FIRE HOLDING MY WRIST SO I COULD FIRE IN MY WRIST WE ALSO HAD A RIFLE UUP IN THE SIGNAL STATION IT WASN'T LOADED THERE WAS NO AMMUNITION IN IT BUT THE PISTOLS WEREN'T HAT BUT THIS RIFLE WASN'T LOADED IT WAS JUST THERE AS A WARNING I HEARD HIS FOOTSTEPSAD THIS IS PERFECTLY TRUE I HEARD HIS FOOTSTEPS COMING UP AND I SAID TO MY OPO I DON'T LIKE THIS VERY MUCH SO THIS OT KEPT KNOCKING ON THE DOOR IN THE END I I' CUT THIS RIFLE AN I THOUGHT NO I CAN'T I KNEW IT WAS UNLOADED AND I THOUGHT NO WHAT AM I GOING TO DO SO I PULD E IT UP THE OTHER WAY AND AS THIS VOICE CAME THROUGH THE THING I LIFTED IT UP AND WAS GOING TO CLOG HIM ON THE HEAD WITH IT HE SAID IT'S ALRIGHT JON ITW'S ONLY ME AND IT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNALMEN FROM DOWN BELOW STUPID WHO'D GOT A DATE I HAD CHANGED WATCHES WITH A GIRL TASI SHOULDN'T HAD TO TELL HER THIS REALLY HE OBVIOUSLY USED TO COME UP FOR A CUP OF TEA AT THIS TIME AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH HER AND HE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON WATCH AND HE NEARLY GOT HIMSELF KILLED AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE IN MY RIGHTS BECAUSE WI NOBODY W HAD GOT A GREAT BIG PROHIBITED NOSEANCE UPON THE DOOR BUT IYOU KNOW INEVER EVER CAME TO ANYTHING AND I NEVER EVER REPORTED IT BECAUSE I I GOT HIM INTO TERRIBLE TROUBLE BUT WE WERE ARMED BUT ONLY WITH A PISTOL AND IHAD A RIFLE WITH NO AMMUNITION BECAUSE WE' HAD A A WREN IN INVERARI WHAT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T KNOW I'M AFRAID ALL THAT IS I NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WE WERE JUST TOLD TO BE VERY AWARE AN TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS AND I THINK STEPHNE MENTIONS THIS IN HER BOOK AS WELL WE NEVER EVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED ANDWE HAD WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A SPY A MAN USED TO COME DOWN IT WAS ALL PROHIBITED LAND FOR CIVILIANS BUT THIS MAN USED TO COME DOWN SIT ON THE ROCKS AND WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS AND HE HAD BNOCS AND A CAMERA WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CONVOYS WE COULD TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AROUND THE CABIN ROUND THE THING BUT NOT A CONVOYNOT ALLOWED TO AN SO WE REPORTED THIS MAN TO OUR HEADQUARTERS BACK IN E SIGNALBACK IN THE STATION HOTEL NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ABOUT IT SOHE JUST DISAPPEARED NO WE NEVER EVER HEARD WHETHER ET WAS JUST A LOCAL NEWSPAPER MAN OR WHETHER HE WAS A KIND OF A SPY OR WHETHER HE WAS JUST INTERESTED IN SHIPS WE NEVER HEARD S I'M AFRAID IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS ALL NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD AND JUST YOU KNOW JUST PICKING UP ON THE AMERICANS WHE YOUYOU WERE SORT OF TALKING ABOUT STORY BECASE THE AMERICANS GAVE YOU SOME HASSE EM YES WELL THEY WOULE TRY TO BRIBE US THEY WANTED TO COME UP THE SIGNAL STATION UM LOOK AT NOW LOOK HONEY WE'VE GOT SOME NILONS OR HONEY WE'VE GOT NILS ONBOARD YOU KNOW I MEAN SO STUPID AND SO CHILDISH E TOOK A DISLIKE TO THEM WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE WAS THE WAY THEY USED TO TREAT THEIR OFFICERS COMPLETE DISRESPECT TEY WOULD CALL THEM BY THEIR FIRST NAMES WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS TERRIBLE AND THE CAPTAINS ALL THE THER OFFICERS NEVER SEEMED TO TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THEM WE WERE IN OBARN ONE DAY SHOPPING AND THE AMERICANS WHOCAME ON BOARD CAME ON ROVACY SHOPPING AS WELL AND EM EWE WERE GLAD TO TAKE US FOR A CUP OF COFFEE OK FINE WHICH THEY DID WE TOOK THEM TO THE YMCAWE HAD A CUP OF COFFEE GOING BACK SOME OF THEIR OFFICERS WERE COMING THE OTHER WAY WELL WE WERE APPALLED THE WAY THEY SPOKE TE NO SALUTING HI HI A CAP I THOUGHT THIS IS TERRIBLE I MEAN I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT THEY WERE JUST ANOTHER WORLD AWAY AND THEY WERE TRYING TO BRIBE US WITH BANANAS AND NIONS AND WEJUST DIDN'T YOU KNOW DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW WE THOUGHT IT WAS TOO CHILDISH UTH ALL THIS VERY FAST FLASHING MORSE YOU TOUCHED ON THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF ERM YOU KNOW COMMUNICATION YOU HAD THE SEMAFORE YOHA YU TALKED ABOUT THE LAMPS THERE YEAH ALL THE LAM SO JUST WHEN DID YOU USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNICATION NEW IS ONE SPECIFIC TYPE IKOVA IN THE STATION NE ALWAYS BY MORSE BY LIGHT OR SOMETIME BY RT EM NEARLY ALWAYS THE ARTIWE REALLY ONLY USED FOR THE ASDIC STATION UM LAMD MOSTLY THE OLDEST AND OLL THE BIG TEN INCH WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT OF COURSE TO HANDLE YOU HAD TO GO OUT ON THE O AND OF COURSE UP THERE THE WINDS WERE ALWAYS AT GALE FORCE AND WE ALWAYS HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOFOR THE WEATHER EVERY DAY WE HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FO THE CONVOYS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER WAS WHAT WERE THE CONES THE CONES WERE OWA U THE CONE WAS A SHAPE LIKE THAT BND YOU HOISTED IT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH WAY NOW UPWARS FOR UPWARDS FOR THE NORTH WIND AND DOWN OFWARDS FOR THE SOUTHWIND VERY PRIMITIVE BUT IT GAVE THEM SOME IDEA OF THE W THE WIND I MEAN ANOTHER THING MEAN YOU COULD TELL THE WAY THE WIND WAS BLOWING JUST LOOK AT THE ENSINE WHICH WE ALWAYS HAD TO FLY THE WHITE ENSIGN AND WE HAD TO B BY THE COLOURS OF THE WHITE ENSIGN PUT IT UP AT SUNRISE AND DOWN AT SUNSET SO THE ENSIGNE WAS ALWAYS FLYING SO YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHICH WAY THE WIND WAS O BLOWING WITHOUT THE CONE BUT IT WAS A GALE FORCE WIND E USED TO PUT THE CONE UP WHICH SOMETIMES MEANT THE COM WAS UP FOR DAYS BECAUSE THE GALES WOULD BLOW UP THERE VERY VERY WINDY AND SOMETIMES WE WOULD HAVE TO BE LASHED ONTO THE TEN INCH BY OUR OPEA BECAUSE IT WAS SO WINDY YOU KEPT BEING BLOWN AWAY ITAIT WAS VERY VERY COLD AND VERY WERE ALWAYS WET BUT WE DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER DID YOU AVE A DO DEVAN BATH OR A SHOWER UP THERE OH WHEN WE WENT BACK TOTO THE ERM HOW LONG WOULD YOU BE SITUATED UP THERE WELL THE NIGHT WATCH WAS A LONG ONE WE'D GO ON SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT O'CLOCK AD COME OFF AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING THAT WAS A VERY LONG ONE UM THE OTHER WATCHES WERE PRETTY WELL FOUR HOURS ON AN FOUR HOURS OFF BUT THE NIGHT WATCH WAS IT WAS A TOUGH ONE BUT D YOU HAD TO WALK THERE AND BAT FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO WALK WE COULDN'T BE OBJECTED BECAUSE THE MAN INMEN IN THE ESDICK STATION DOWN BELOW US GOT TRANSPORT THEY WERE WORKING THE SAME WATCHES OH WELL YES OK THEN THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD ISSUE US WITH BICYCLES WHICH THEY DID EM WE HAD A WREN OFFICER CAME UP TO SEE US AND SHE SAID THIS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND THEN THEY SUPPLIED TRANSPORT FOR US SOWE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK THE NIGHT WATCH BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS A THREE OR FOUR MILES IN THE PITCH DARK ALONG ALL THE COAST ROAD BUT FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO BEFORE THEY REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING THAT'S AMAZING E S A STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK O O YE THAT THE DUKE OF YORK WELL WE WE NEVER HAD THE ERY BIG SHIPS THE BIGGEST SHIP URM ESCORT SHIP THAT EVER REALLY CAME INTO US EWERE DESTROYERS OR OR CO CORFETZ UM BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS USED TO GO INTO MAL TO WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS TO GO BACK OUT SO WE NEVER REALLY HAD ANYTHING WHAT I WOULD CALL VERY LARGE I WAS ON WATCH WITH STEPHNEY UM ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION AND IF YOUK CAN PICTURE KN THE ISLANDS AND THE SEA AND SUDDENLY YOU SEE A GREAT BIG CROSS ANCHOR A CROSS MASK COMING AT YOU AND THING WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE WE HAD NO ETA FOR ANYTHING WE HAD NOTHING WHAT EVERYTING I WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY YOU KNOW IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT COURSE WE CALLED IT UP NO REPLY OF COURSE THAT WAS WORRYING NO REPLY BECAUSE HET WAS A SPECIAL EERY EVERY HOUR IT CHANGED THE CALL UP SIN A CHANGED ON HE CODE BOOK SO YOU WOULD CALL THEM UP BY THE CODE WHICH IT WAS FOR THE DAY ANO REPLY SO WE HAD A LITTLE SHIP WE HAD TWO SHIPS ACTUALLY ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN STAR ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN WAVE AN THEY WERE PATROL SHIPS WHICH USED TO PATROL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AMONG THE CONVOYS ALL THE TIME THEY WERE OLD WHAT I WOULD CALL SOMETHING LIKE A CORVETTE UM I THINK THEY WERE OLD TRAWLERS THEY WERE MANNED BY ERM NAVY AND THEY WERE IF ANY TROUBLE WE CALLED THEM UP IMMEDIATELY AND THEN WE CAOLED UP THE SOUTHERN STAR SHE WAS WAY OUT OVER MUL AND ASKED HER WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHE SAID I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING FROM HERE ECAUSE THEY WOULD BE INA WAY WA BUT SHE SAID I'LL GO AND INVESTIGATE SHE SAID IF IRE'S ANYTHING N TROUBLE I'LL PUT A SHOT ACROSS ITS BOWLS THAT WAS THAT ANYWAY THIS THING GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER EVENTUALLY I MANAGED TO CALL UT OBVIOUSLY THE THE BUNTING TOSSER THAT'S WHAT VISUAL SIGNALS ARE CALLED BUNTING TOSSERS WAS ASLEEP I SHOULD THINK HE THOUGHT OH WL WE'RE ONLY CRUISING ROUND THESE ISLANDS AND HE CAME BACK QUICKLY WITH D OF Y INSTEAD OF A PENNANT NUMBER BECAUSE ALL SHIPS HAVE PENNAT NUMBERS EITHER THE PENANT NUMBER OF THE SHIP OR THE CODE HE CAME BACK WITH NOTHING QUICKLY D OF Y AND I SAID TO STEPHINI D OF Y DUKE OF YORK SAD GOSH IT'S A BATTLESHIP I SAID BASE DON'T KNO SO WE QUICKLY PHONED OUR BASE AND THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE US ECAUSE NOBODY HAD GOT ON ETA ANYWAY THE CAPTAIN OF THEOUR CAPTAIN BASE CAME RUSHING DOWN TOOKHIMG ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO GET TO US BY WHICH TIME SHE WAS IN FULL VIEW MASSIVE GRAVEIT JUST FILLED UP THE WHOLE OF THE BAY I'VE NEVER SEEN ANAYTHING LIKE IT AND OF COURSE IT WAS A GREAT BIG HOHAR ABOUT THIS WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW LLOF COURSE SHE WAS ON SHE WAS ON PILGRIMAGE UP TO NORWAY AFTER THE ERMASHARNHORST AND SHE WAS DOING THIS TO EM TOI SUPPOSE SHE THOUGHT OH WE'VE GOT TIME TO DOING I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DID IT THEY WERE WAY OFF COURSE I MEAN IT W NOTHING OUD EVER SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN WAS WAY VERY WELL BECUSE IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS OUT THERE BUT SHE DID SHE CAME RIGHT PAST US SAILING JUST OFF MULL I MEAN I COULD SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE SHE WAS IT WAS ON THE MAP UM SHE JUST APPEARED BEHIND THE ISLAND AS IF IT WAS ON SOME KIND OF A FILM IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND IT WAS SORT OF THING YOU 'LDVE TO DREAM ABOUT LOVELY STORY LOVELY STORY EN NOBODY EVER REALLY AGAIN A NEED TO KNOW WE NEVER EVER REALLY FOUND OUT E WE REALISED AFTERWARDS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT F YOU WERE ON HER WAY UP TO THE BATTLE IN NORWAY DRINK OF TEA PLEASE ER DI DAY O YES ERM HEN DDA CAME WE HAD ALL THE SHIPS WE HAD WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT WHY THEY LOOKED SO DREADFUL THEY WERE ALL SORT OF BATTERED SHIPS WE THOUGHT WELL SEEN SOME AWFUL SIGHTS BUT THEY WERE ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY OF THEM I SHOULD THINK WITH TWO DESTROYERS DURBAN AND SOMETHING ELSE N ONE WAS THE DURBAN I SOMTHIN MAYBE I'VE WRITTEN MAYBE SHE MENTIONED THEM IN TA BOOK ANYWAY AND WE THOUGHT GOD A DESTROY JUNT I IT WAS A TERRIBLE STATE SURELY THE NAVY KNO THEY WERE INWE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE THEY CAME IN I SUPPOSE THEY WERE IN ABOUT A WEEK OR MORE THAN TH TEN DAYS ENOUGH TIME FOR DEPNE TO GET TO KNOW THIS SIGNAL AN AND THEY SAID IT MUST BE TEN DAYS A EM WE STILL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WEREN'T SUCH O AND WHY THEY DIDN'T BECAUSE THEY ONLY EVER STAYED OTWO OR THREE DAYD BUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A LONG TIME AND WE THOUGHT HELLO SOMETHING SOMETHING'S GOING ON THEN ALL OUR WE WERE TOLD WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO POST ANY MORE LETTERS ALL THEUR LETTERS WERE TO BE CANCELLED ALL THEIR POSTAGE OUT WAS TO BE CANCELLED EVERYTHING GOING OUT FROM THE BASE WAS TO BE STOPPED AND ALL LEAVE WAS STOPPED AN WE THOUGHT SOMETHING'S IN THE AIR OU KNOW YOU GET THAT FEELING UM WE THOUGHT EL WHERE ARE THEY GOING WHAT RE THEY GOING TO DO OF COURSE THEY WERE THE BLOCKSHIPS UM ON THE NIGHT BEFORE D DAY THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT OR SO THEY SAID UM THE NIGHT BEFORE EMWE ALL SEEMED TO BE GETTING READY THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG SHIP CAME ALONGSIDE SOME OF THEM AND TOOK OFF A LOT OF STUFF WE THOUGHT THEY DON'T USUALLY UNLOAD HERE IT GOES TO GOOK AND GRANOCK BUT THEY WERE UNLOADING ALL SORTS OF STUFF AND WE WATCHED THEM THROUGH THE TELESCOPE YOU KNOW CHAIRS AND TABLES AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS WERE COMING UP WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS NO NO NEXT DAY E WHEN WE CAME UP ON WATCH THEY WERE ALL BUSY GETTING READY TO GO OUT AND WE HAD NO EXPECTED TIME OF DEPARTURE AT ALL THEY ALL JUST SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR OUR TWO PATROL SHIPS HAD NO IDEA THEY SAID WHAT DO WE DO WHERE THEY'RE GOING WHERE WE HAD' WE COULDN'T TELL THEM O COURSE IT WAS SO SECRET AND THAT'S THE END OF THE DDAY THAT WAS ALL THE BLOCKSHIPS GOING DOWN THEY WERE ALL ROTTEN OLD SHIPS HAT NOBODY WANTE THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD BEEN SO BUTTLE SCARRED THAT THEY WERE ALMOST UNSINKABLE SO THEY WERE THE TWO BIG BLOCK SHIPS AND THESE WERE SENT ON TO HELP OUT AN WE NEVER EVER HEARD UNTIL THE END OF THE WAR WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT NTHESE OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS YOU TOUCHED ON EARLIER BUT I'D LIKE MORE CLARIFICATION ON IS IS THE CONVOYS ESSENTIALLY YOU DID TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTATION NOW CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN AGAIN FOR ME YOU KNOW HOW THE PROCESS A DISPATCH RIDER WOULD ARRIVE FROM BASE FOR THE STATION HOTEL WHICH IS THEIR BASE A STATCH RIDER WOULD ARRIVE WITH A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH WOULD CONTAIN ETA OF THE NEXT CONVOY COMING IN AND RIGHT SO YOU'D THEN GET IT OUT PUT IT IN FRONT OF YOU PUT IT UP AND WAIT FOR THE FIRST ONE LITERALLY TO COME IN T ETAO NINE HUNDRED YOU PERHAPS S WOLSTART COME IN TO O NINE THREE HUNDRED THEY'D OBVIOUSLY BEEN MARKED I SUPPOSE I THINK FROM IRELAND THEY WERE THEN SORT OF EM MARKED ACROSS O WOU'D GET THE ETA OF THEM COMING ACROSS M THAT WAS LITERALLY HOW WE GOT THE ETAS FROM A DISPATCH WRIDER A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WOULD COME UM I SUPPOSE THEYEE BAT EVERY THE CONVOYS WERE COMING IN QUITE REGULARLY AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH COMING IN BY THE TIME THEY'D GONE OUT AGAIN THE BAY WAS ALWAYS REALLY YOU ALWAYS CHOKABLOCK THENOF COURSE YOU GOT THEY ALSO GOT THE RAF BOATS GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH THEIR SUNDERLAND AND TE ERM CATELINAS SO IT WAS QUITE A BUSY LITTLE HARBOUR AND EVERY SINGLE THING HAD TO BE LOGGED AND LOGED OUT IDENTIFIED ND PUT DOWN YOU KNOW ASO YOU HAD TO BE ON WATCH PRETTY WELL AWARE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON ALL ROUND YOU LITERALLY IN THE AIR OVER THE CATALNAS THIS IS WHY WE HAD TO HAVE SOUTHERN WAVE AND SOUTHERN STAR WHO USED TO BE OUT THEY WERE
