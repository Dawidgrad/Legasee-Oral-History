now while i was although i was a messenger rene sally and myself were the three there and we were taking and logging signals and mostly they were signals from say no north africa a lot of i learned more about the human body i suppose then than i ever knew before you know because they come through wounded in action and let maybe give you the details most of the time they would sometimes it didn't and then they would end up by saying a next of kin informed or not informed well we didn't do that bit we had to log these signals then get signatures from the officers in charge of a wherever you know whatever so from that point of view it could be very sad but you just had to let it ride over you you know but i suppose if you were over sensitive i don't know but we three of us coped all right but we were next door the s t o then there was the switchboard in there and that we were next door to the commanding officer who was i think he was a lieutenant colonel then or he met may have been colonel his name was boy so everybody said he was a very strict but a quite fare well if we had a turn of the giggles for instance we would have not knock knock on the role and that made us laugh even more now but if one of the marines made up a little ditty about him and it went i can still remember it there lived a colonel long ago rejoicing in the name of po but disliking this utensil he grabbed himself the nearest pencil and with a noise resembling glee he placed two dots above the e in this manner somewhat showy his staff now have to call him pay so and that it was just a oohereed that made this competent gigot fate did you get a sense of how things were going on in toye yet you could get a sense of that you could get a sense of that with the number of casualties and so forth are coming through great stood at you you you heard the name or you knew of well am the names i didn't recognize any but but one of em the chief officer ren officer in charge now what was her name something like wainwright i think with her one of her sons was killed and she was a lovely person really you know you consider your a persons in charge are always a nasty but she certainly was when she was lovely and but she did have her i think him through you know they said that she died just be careful the microphone earlier that must have been quite dramatic or yes is the message is coming through to you code no a cat they came through on a tele printer in fool they want coded you just described the set up well the set up as a biggish thing you know and then when you heard the thing the noise when it started up you knew there was something coming in you know and then you had to wait until that was finished and then it put time of to time of receipt et cetera on there and that was it then from that point you had to log it in a book and and then that book was circulated to the officer who was responsible for whichever section you know am i can remember there was calver was one that got an awful lot of those calls so he must have been in that section lieutenant calver c v but i can't remember all of them now were these were these specific you know where they relative to regiments or were they just let everybody injured on well it didn't always say what it just gave her name and number you know but it didn't you couldn't really say that they were seaforth highlanders or gordon islanders or whatever you know
