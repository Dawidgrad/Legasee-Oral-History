you talked about our action stations you talked about the red white and blue watch system what what entertainment was there on board rene was there a cinema later on in the war we got we were day that we had a sixteen mill projector and they could show films around various parts of the ship but later on we we had an aircraft hanger as we carried two aircraft on board and when we went the when the the the aircraft were taken off the ship i think about ninety forty one forty two time and then that was converted into a cinema so we could you know we could you could have a film but it was sixteen or then and it became thirty five million i think and and the only other entertainmentwould be the loud speaker and the mastic whatever it was connected to you know you could hear the news each day that we were all you know with our ears glued to the news her winston churchill speaking or something some some some very serious business going on ships being sunk or aircraft being sunk or a thousand bomber raids or something so we'd all listen intently to the nine o'clock news every night or would they thawed be probably in the rec space or something having a smoke and if you weren't on watch and then the loud speaker would be on the bulkhead and you you'd be listening to the news you know till we were all we had no newspapers of course now and again somebody on the ship might think up you know if if you were going away from this some time a schoolmaster one might produce a weekly newspaper you over the with the news that had come over and and push push it round in paper form for us to read you know but entertainment you we played tom bowler of course what they called well is tom bowler not and we mostly there was always a naval game you know tom bowler called the numbers out and we have that maybe three times a week and we may have a ship with you know after a while we got a bit organized there were some good singers on board and the next thing they had a ship's concert party going and he and that so we we made our own entertainment really or you'd be sitting in the mess you could be playing there may be chests or drafts or cards or a ludo that we call occurs and the so you major you made your own entertainment really the ship you see had been completely gutted out and all that was left was the hull so the rebuilt and put new guns and new armament and new engines and everything in her she's a very fast ship marina and renown could do over thirty two thirty three knots so we very often left the destroyers behind and bad weather they couldn't keep up with us so we done a lot of time on our own and zigzagging of course uno trying to dodge any eu boots around well what won't you remember of heading up to scape the first time i was he beat based on a bit but can you remember that you know once the war had been dect and you went off to join the police yes it was all all a bit of a shock on the first day and then you know you suddenly got used to to to being at war and getting a jilled into every day and you had to keep a good look out for everything that was happening you know and now we got up on scapa flow and the next thing there was some german bombers came over and we suddenly realized they were people dropping bombs on top of us so we had to uno open fire and fend them off we shot a couple of them down but they hit a couple of ships i think they missed us anyway we didn't get it but so german bombers came over scapa flow and then end and then of course the we moved from scapa flow and went up to to lock a lock fine on one of those places we were lucky really because i we moved out but before the the new boat came in and sank the royal oak so where the royal oak was sunk in scamper flow in october october i think one october nineteen thirty nine we were a fellow called preen and a german ewboat as he managed to get into scapa flow and he sunk the royal oak he'd have sunk a few more ships if we'd been in there i think because nobody expected they thought you know we were in a safe anchorage as they had to you know they they they had barricades around and nets and things like that but they they they they hadn't reckoned on the fellow coming in at high tide and he slipped in over the barricades and got into the flow and got out again and and sunk a ship and on his way what did you did you did you hear about the royal by son having that affected the crew why we just well we just felt it could have been us i suppose you know as if every ship that was puncture in the war you heard about it you know it it it puts you on your metal a bit more really too and somebody said keep a good look out and watch what you're doing and and make sure you know when your action stations that you hope to you know to shoot down an aircraft or sink a submarine or sink of a surface vessel some so it sharpens you up a bit really you know and then especially when we heard that the hood had been sunk you now which was one of our one of our sister ships there was the hood the repulse and the renown of the three battle cruisers well the hood was sunk with the ere were only three survivors out of fourteen hundred odd men on board men and boys of course am so if a ship blew up like that there wasn't much hope for anybody i suppose we just accept it didn't now without we were in it and that's it
