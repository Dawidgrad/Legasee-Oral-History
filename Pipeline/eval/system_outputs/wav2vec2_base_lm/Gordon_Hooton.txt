TURBINES MADE ALL THE ELECTRIC BUT SHE DIDN'T DRAW HALF AS MUCH UNDER THE WATER AS AN ORDINARY DESTROY OR AN ORDINARY SLOOP WHICH WAS PROVED ON THE LAST DAY OF THE WAR OR THE CONVOY AND WE WERE ALL WAITING AROUND OUTSIDE TO GO THROUGH THE MOUNTING GAP INTO INTO THE RUSSIAN END AND THAT HER BOAT WAS WAITING FOR US AND WE WERE ALL THERE AND THE CONVOY WAS COMING IN IT ON THE TELLY SOMETIMES COMBO

WATER MASTER HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT YOU SAY AND CAUSE THAT GIVE ME QUART TO RUN AS A SHIP AND THEN THE CAPTAIN HE HAD ME UP HIS CABIN AND HAD A CHAT WITH ME AND TOLD ME WHAT HE WANT ME TO DO AND IT WAS IT WAS NICE I MEAN I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE STEERAGE WHICH MEANS THAT THE OTHER CHAPS ARE UNDER ME STRAY AWAY I'D NEVER STEER A BLOODY SHIP BUT I HAD TO MEN IT AIN'T GOT A COMPASS LOT YOU WHEN YOU SEE THE OLD HANDS GOING AT YOU GOT NUMBERS FLICKING BACKWARD AND FORWARD AND YOU HAD TO READ EM AND HER BUT WE DID HAVE ONE IN THE OLD ONE WHAT A SHIP JAPANESE YOU WERE SORTING YOU WELL THAT WAS THE BIGGEST THEIR CRUISE I CAN'T SINK IN AND DON'T ASK ME THE NAME I CAN'T TELL YOU BUT IT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE I HAD THAT THAT ALAN SHE'D BEEN BOMBED AND SHE LAY IN THE HARBOUR WE USED TO GOOD BY OR EVERY TIME HE WENT IN AND OUT BUT WE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON THE BOTTOM BUT SHE WASN'T BUT ANYWAY IT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE OF THE JAPANESE SHIPS AND IT HAD BEEN BOND AND IT HAD BEEN IN SEEING A POOR HARBOR FOR QUITE SOME TIME SINCE IT WAS IT AND BUT ANYWAY ON WE NOW KNOW THAT WERE MAKING IT READY TO TOW IT AND SINK IT YOU SEE AND WE GOT CHOSE TO DO IT AND WE WERE COMING ON OUR WAY HOME AS IT HAPPENED AND IT WAS WE LEFT SEEING A POOR WITHER AND WITH A TUB WITH HER TOO TALKED WITH HER ANKLE AND SHE WAS A MASSIVE SHIP AND SHE'D BEEN EMPTIED AND EVERYTHING AND IT GOT DARK AND WE COMING UP THE MALACCA STRAITS AND WE GOT TO THIS POINT WHERE WE SHE SUPPOSED HAVE BEEN SUNK THE DEEPEST WATER COULD SEE WAS THE BIGGEST WOULDN'T I HAD AT THE TIME AND A CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS PITCH BLACK AND WE'RE ON HER WAY COMING TO COME HOME YOU SEE IT COME TO MIDNIGHT AND A TWO TWO JAPANESE TUGS YOU WERE TOWING HER HAD BEEN TOWING HER ANDROID OUT ON AIR WHILE AS FAR AWAY FROM US FURTHER THAN THAT THE BIG AS ARE THEY WERE FROM US BUT THEY WERE COMMON UP AGAIN THE COAST ALONG AND WE WERE FURTHER AT WHERE WE COULD KEEP AIR OR ON EVENING AND AS I SAY IT GOT PITCH BLACK AND WITH THE TIME WE GOT TO THE POINT WHICH WE HAD A COMPASS READING WE GOT A SINKER ON THEY STARTED THE SHIP COMING UP AND LEFT HER THEY BOLTED AND LEFT THE SHIP WE NO HEADWAY AND SHE'D COME HALF WAY UP NEARLY TO WHERE SHE EXPOSED TO BEEN SUNK AND I EXPECT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IF HER CAPTAIN GOT PERMISSION TO SINK HER BUT IT WAS MID NO IT PITCH BLACK AND WE HAD AIR SEARCH LOW IT HONOR AND THEY VANISH INTO THE BLACK AND GONE OF COURSE SHE'S DRIPPED AT WHAT SHE WOULDN'T BE FUR BUT I MEAN SHE'S A MASSIVE SHIP BUT SHE WAS ONLY JUST OFF THE COAST LOIN AS WE THOUGHT PITCH BLACK AND I'M STILL ON THE BLOODY WHEEL OR AM OF COURSE LOOKING AT THE WHEEL AS WELL BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T GO IN WE WERE JUST ALBURY AND WE I SUPPOSE THE CAPTAIN GOT IN TOUCH WITH THEIR PEOPLE AND THEY SAID WHAT TO DO SO WE HAD TO SEND MEN OVER WITH DEPTH CHARGES CAUSE WE CARRIED DEPTH CHARGES AND THEY GOT TO PUT THE DEPTH CHARGES AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE IN THE SHIP CASE NOBODY ON THERE AND A MAN IT WERE MASSIVE AND THEY'D GOT TO WAR EVERYTHING UP AND WITH ALL WE COULD DO WAS USE THEIR DEPTH CHARGES AND HER AND TRY EM THAT'S AT ALL WE COULD DO WELL WE DID WE DID IT AT MIDNIGHT WHEN WE STARTED AND WE WERE DRIPPED IN A FOUR WAY PERHAPS AS HIS FIRST TALES FROM HER AND HER COURSE I COULDN'T DO MUCH REALLY CAUSE HER MOTOR BOAT WENT OVER AND THEY TOOK I THINK I PUT FOUR DEPTHS YARD YOU DINNER IN THE MOTOR BOAT AND THAT'S ALL SHE HAD OLD YOU SEE CARRY AND SO THEY TOOK THEM OVER FROM OFF A VERSE A VERY CREW YOU SEE DOING IT AND WHATEVER THEY DONE THEY WENT ABOARD THE SHIP AND I TOOK THESE DEPTH CHARGES AS THE CAPTAIN HAD SAID HE GOT TO BE DONE AND PUT EM RIGHT DOWN IN THE LOW RENDERS THEY COULD GET TO THE SHIP COULD A MAN SHE WHAT A BLOODY MASS OF SEEING AND DONE HE DID EBEN HE COULDN'T FOOD EVERYTHING BUT WOULD EXPLODE AND CAME BACK TO US AND BANG SHE DID SHE WENT DOWN AND BLEW THE BARTMELL AND SHE WENT DOWN OF COURSE WE NEVER SEE IN NO MORE COULD WE LEFT HER THERE WHETHER SHE SHE WANT TO FAR OFF THE COAST AND SHE WANT TO FUR FROM PENANG THE SHIP WASN'T WE WERE GOING UP TOWARDS PENAN AND HE DID YOU THINK LIKE THAT OH YEAH WE WANT TO BE THEIR SEARCH LOT HE HAS BETHEL THINK THAT HE WILL BE ON ON TILL WE SAY OF MORE LESS THE THE MARK WAS STICKING OUT OF SEEING THAT'S ALL BUT SHE'S STILL GOING SHE'S STILL GOING DOWN SO SHE PITCHED HER MEN PUT DEPTH CHARGES ALL THE WAY ALONG SO WHEN SHE GOT TO THE CERTAIN DEPTH THAT OPENED THE DEPTHS THAT NOW THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP TO LET THE WATER IN AS YOU DO AND WE HAD TO SIT THERE UNTIL IT FILLED UP AND UN FOR DAYS CHARGE IN EL I BLOODY YOU NEVER SEE LIKE IT IT WAS FABULOUS BUT OF COURSE IF YOU WE WANT LOVE DAD CAMERAS TO TALK A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD MIND SWEET AS THE STORY WE DO HOW YOU DO IT FOR WHETHER THOSE VARIOUS WAYS YOU CAN DO IT YOU CAN DO IT WITH THE WARS OUT WITH FLOATS ON AND WATER THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN PUT DEPTHS DOWN PUT EM DOWN TO CERTAIN DEPTHS AND LEAVE EM DOWN THERE WAITING EM DOWN IT DEPENDS WHAT'S GOING TO BE THERE OVER EM AND THAT WHEN YOU COME BACK BUT BASICALLY YOU ONLY DO IT TO CLEAR THE OCEAN IN THE AIR YOU'RE IN AND IF THERE'S BEEN SHIPS CLOTHING WITH EM AND WE GET SON AT WE GET SENT OUT THERE TO SWEEP IT YOU HAVE A NEAR MISSES WITH THE MINES WELL WE HAD EM COME UP BESIDE US HERE I'VE TOLD ME TO BUT WHEN YOU'RE ALL JOINED TOGETHER WE WHAT GREAT STRONG LAWYERS YOU'RE IN A FORMATION LIKE THAT AND EACH SIDE I BE GOES APE TO ANOTHER SHIP AND THEN THEY GO OUT TO ANOTHER ONE AND THEN TO THE OTHER THEN YOU GOT SEVEN BUT YOU'RE THE ONE IN THE FRONT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOT PROBABLY MORE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU CAN SOUND THAN THE OTHERS YOU SAID THEY DO THAT SORT OF THING THEY KEEP IMPROVING ON CERTAIN THINGS AND WE MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S HOW YOU SWEEP THAT'S WEEP YOU'RE ALL OVER LATER EACH OTHER AND YOU IT TO YOU AS A WIFE HOLDING YOU GET NO NO NO IT'S ALL DONE FREE THEY BRING THEM UP TO SET THERE WILL EAT SO I DO YOU AT THE CERTAIN DISTANCE AND THEN VICE VERSA FOR THE NEXT TO AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT THAT'S WHEN YOU DO IT THAT TO BE SWEEP BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS YOU CAN YOU CAN SWEEP AND THERE SO WE USED TO DO SWAPS SWEEPS WITH THE LONG WAR AS WE HAD A GREAT BIG THING ON THE QUARTERDECK AND IT WAS FULL OF HEAVY WARIER AND FOR US TO LET THAT AT WITH THINGS ON THAT YOU KNOW AND A CAPTAIN ON THE BRIDGE I SAY LET GO AND THEN YOU STOP IT WHEN HE TELLS YOU CAN GET A MASSIVE SACK STACK OF WARRIOR ON A DRUM AND IT'S NOT HEAVY WAR BUT THE YOU PUT ANYTHING ON THE END OF IT YOU SEE AND YOU CAN LET IT OUT IF IT WILL EXPLODE MINE OR YOU'LL FIND IT IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU'LL KNOW WHERE YOU STAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER IF YOU USE TO ALL DONE ON LUCK REALLY BUT YOU CAN'T LOOK DOWN IN THE SEA BUT WE USED TO SNAG UP AND WE SNAGGED UP ON AN AEROPLANE THERE THERE THE CRASHED AND HER SO WE WERE TOLD IT WERE I DON'T KNOW I NEVER SEEN IT BUT WE KNOW WHEN IT SNAGGED IT AND GOT ROUND A SHIP BUT IT WAS A PLAN AND I DON'T KNOW WHO AM I KNEW OF COURSE WE DIDN'T STOP BUT YOU ALSO GOT SOMEBODY THAT MAY SOMETHING UP DIDN'T YOU YOU MENTION THIS ABOUT HIS CHANCE YOU KNOW HIS CHANCE OF A UPON BY RAISING WHEN YOU SAY MAKE LIFE OF GOOD AND YOU MEAN IF HE DID AS WELL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WE COME HOME TO ENGLAND AND I HAD THE AIR MOST OF THE TIME AND BECAUSE I USED TO GO SIT WITH HIM IN AN OLD TAKE IT CAUSE I RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM IS SO SO THEY DIDN'T WILL HAVE A A LONG THING I'LL JUST TAKE IT YOU SEE IN THE WELL AND ONE NIGHT AS THAT DOING THAT I HAD TO BE A CORNER MASTER WHICH MEANS WHEN WE WERE AT ANCHOR I HAD TO DO A DUTY AT THE BACK OF THE SHIP WHERE THE WHERE THEY COME IN A NAVE OF IT WHEN I GO ASHORE AND
