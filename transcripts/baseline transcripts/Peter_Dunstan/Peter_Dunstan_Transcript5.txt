right so after after you've been into the mediterranean was that was it good to get was it good to go from you know to start seeing parts of the world do you have any recollection of the fact that you've gone from america canada back to me you never thought about it it was just a duty and you just carried on it's only now you're asking these questions i can think back about it i've had no at the time you were you were on duty you had a job to do and that's it you carried on you never thought about seeing gibraltar or america or a thing like that just it was part of duty and you just carried on well you're on the ship and you've been on it for sort of nine you know eight eight seven or eight months now what's the camaraderi line now did you for dustin to form good friendships oh yes i mean as a as a romain detachment of a hundred and eighty a allow you you am you formed a closer relationship with the a ten other raw marines or nine other roll marines that were on the mestec i mean the mestec comprised of a well a hundred and eighty ten a ten twenty mastic and there were ten other nine of the role marines on your mistake and you you got to know them more than anything else there were other raw marines that were in the squad that war you trained with that term you knew and we were friends with but you mainly got to know that the nine others on your mess deck what sort of stuff did you get up to with them can you remember you know cards games fun jokes ah now what was what was it i was making i can't remember now but we all had a hobby and i know i had a i can't remember now what it was i i was making something on the best deck of an evening when when you were free and you had a hobby you were either writing or doing something like that of an evening how much you know how big was the room how big was his face a mistake well now i should say it was about about ten times the size of this room huge mistake because at night in the ceiling were a big big steel pipes or hangers and used to hang your hammock hammock up on those on these hooks and you slept in the hammock above above the mess deck what was it like that was easy to adapt to my sleeping in a ha oh yes you in those days you were young and innocent still innocent and but you've just got on with it i mean a hammock is quite comfortable for ufos i am asleep again and the old the old soldiers as we used to call them the old old romarines they used to help us youngsters and anything that what he doing get us into the life of a living aboard as a food do you remember much of the food and only get a sense you know what life was like when you weren't case i was see ninety nine per cent boredom and one per cent terror so i just wondering about that you know when you're not working what you're doing well as i say you all had a hobby of some sort another and then each day a one one person on the mess deck was responsible for for the a for the food and used to have to go down to the galley a the main ship's galley where all the food was cooked and tell them the mess number and they used to dish out the ration for the food then you used to go back to the mess deck and put the plates out and a either either helped yourself or and you served it out so that everybody got equal equal rations cause you very likely know when you put a plate down on a table with six people there's there's a one of the six is going to be greedy and grab as much as they can so as raw marines men you you dished it out equally and everybody got the same you knew that the next day the one of your mates on the on the mess deck would be doing be doing cook of the mess and so if he didn't get treated right you didn't get treated right so you you marked in messed in with a the comradeship that had developed had you lost any when you got on board and you were in your mess had you lost any of your comrades during any of the conflicts that you had about no no we went no we didn't lose anybody in october you set sail for the far east oh ye well if it was called g force that with it yet we set fire to the far east called in at cape town cape town was neutral they were told at seven o'clock in the morning it's funny i can remember some of these things seven o'clock in the morning on the radio cape town was told that the battleship prince wales was coming in the repulse that was with us she went up to durban we called in at cape town seven o'clock in the morning the people in cape town were told that the battleship prince wales coming in and i seem to seem to recall about eleven o'clock twelve o'clock we at eleven o'clock we pulled in to cape town twelve o'clock there was three or four hundred people waiting at the or gates so that those who were on leave that day who were free to have a day's leave you were allowed to go out into the town and we were picked up i was picked up with two petty officers or that of the royal navy by a family by the name of glove the father of
