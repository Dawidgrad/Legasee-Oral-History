GIRLS GETTING TO US WHEN YOU GET TO A STATION THAT STARTED THE CHAT WE GOT FRIENDLY NONE OF US EVER KNEW EACH OTHER COME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE ANYWAY THAT WAS A LONG TRIP UP TO GLADSGOW GLASGOW QUITE A FEW TIMES I THIK FOR AIR RAIDS AFOR NO REASON I BELIEVE WE STOPPED AT CARLYLE AND THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED THE CARRIAGES LOVELY CUPS OF TEA AND SANDWICHES PASSED ACROSS FROM THE S OR WHOEVER NOW ANYWAY AFTER A A LITTLE REST N STARTED THO TRAIN AGAIN AS WE DREW OUT OT THE STATION I REMEMBER THERE WAS FACTORY BY THE SIDE OF THE STATION RIGHT ON TE TRACK AN OLD MILL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AD OUT OF THEE WINDOWS THERE WAS BALLOONS AND GIRLS WAVING THE BLOONS WER NOT SOME OF THE BALLOONS I CAN REMEMBER I THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OF ANOTHER TYPE WHICH I WON'T MENTION BUT ANYWAY THAT WAS NICE WE LOVED THAT THE FACT OF BEING YUCHEERED ON OUR WAY WE EVENTUALLY ARRIVED IN GLAZSGO AND THE TRAIN T CHANGED STRAIGHT AWAY OVER TO BEEN A LOCAL TRAIN THAT TRAIN TOOK US TO GRENOK GRNOTH WAS OUR DESTINATION AND WE WERE THEN PUT INTO IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE WMC A BIG BILDING AD WE WERE THEN TOLD THAT WE WERE DUE TO AVE SHIPS COMPANY OF A BRAND NEW SHIP BUILT IN THE SHIPYARD WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO WYAMIS FAVORITEWYMJA REALLY NOW IT WASN'T READY WE COULD GO AND LOOK OVER THE SHIP ANY TIME WE LIKED AND MASS OF WIRES AND PEOPLE WELLED IN AD I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT WE DID WE MUST HAVE WALKED ABOUT GRENOK ANYWAY IN A FEW WEEKS THE SHIP WAS READY ALL THE OLD WIRES AND BITS AND PIECES HAD BEEN REMOVED AND WE WERE PLACES I WAS ON THE FOREHEAD MESS DECK WE WERE POINTED OUT WHERE WE HAD OUR LOCKER WHRE WEANOU CLOTHES WE WERE IN UNIFORM NOW OF C ALL OUR CIVILIAN CLOTHES HAD GONE SO WE JUST HAD AL NAVAL CLOTHES THE FIRST THINGS WE HAD TO DO GO THROUGH AS THE TRIALS WERE TAKEN UP THE CLYDE YOU HAD TO DO THE SPEED WHATEVER S DETERMINED D A FEW GUNNERY TTRIALLD ANYWAY WHEN WE FINISHED THE TRIALS AND THE SHIP WAS COMMISSIONED THN INTO THE ROYAL NAVY THAT WAS THE TIME WE WA GOING TO BE OFF NONE OF US WAS TOLD TAT WE WERE GOING TO GO ON A CERTAIN DAY SO IF WE HAPPENED TO BE HAVING SHURE LEAVE WE COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY BUT THEN ONE DARK NIGHT FTER WED FINISHED OUR TRIALS WE SLIPPED FROM THE DOCK DOCKSIDE OF THE YARD THEOTHER YARD AND EDGED OUR WAY UP THROUGH THE CLYDE NO LIGHTS OF COURSE WE CLOSED ALL THE WATER TIGHT DOORS ALL THE SCUTTLES ALL THE DEAD LIGHTS AND WE WERE GIVEN OUR TIONS THAT WE WE'RE ON WATCH THEN WE WERE REAL SAILORS THEN SO I WAS STARBOARD WATCH SO THERE FOR I WOULD HAV BE UP ON THE HALF AN HOUR F ON THE STARBOARD LOOKOUT WE WE NEVER HAD ANY ACTUAL TRAINING FOR THIS WE JUST WERE TOLD TO DO WHAT WE WERE TOLD SO ANYWAY WE EZED OUT OF THE CLYDE YOU HAVE TO GO PAST THE BOOM WHICH LET YOU OUT OF THE TIDE DE D I REMEMBER I CAME OFF WATCH ORI HADN'T GONE ON WATCH I CAN'T REMEMBER AT THE STAE BUTI'D HAD REASON TO GO TO THE HEADE WHICH ARE THE TOILETS I'D SIT DOWN JUST SITTING DOWN NDTHERE'S AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION BANG THE ORS RATTLED PULL MY TROUSERS UP QUICKLY RUSHED OUT OF T THE DOOR INTO THE WHAT THEY CALLED THE CANTEEN FLAT THAT'S JUT PASSAGE WAY AN BUMPED INTO ONE OF THE OTHER SAILORS WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERIENCE ON ME I SAID WE'V BEEN TORPEDOED AN OR F NIGHT OU NO IT'S ONLY TORPEDOE AND TRYING T H CHAGE IT OUT BIT SHAME FACED I DIDNYOT GO BACK HE SAID WELL YOU WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE THEREE ANYWAYSO WE HAD A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT THAT ANYWAY FROM THERE AS I SAY IT WAS A DARK NIGHT IT ALL SO CLANDESTONE WHEN YOU LEFTWELLTHIS IS ONE THE PROBLEMS THE ENEMY KNEW THAT THEE WAS SHIPS BEING BUILT NEARLY ALL THE TIME AND THEY WOULD COME OUT OF THE CLYDE OR COME OUT OF THE TINE OR PERHAPS COME OUT OF IRELAND ADYOU COALN VISUALIZE IRELAND AND SCOTLAND IT NARROWS IT'S REALLY WIDE LODISTANCE BUT IT NARROWS AS A CONTINENT AND THEREFORE SHIPS HAVE TO COME IN AND OUT OF THAT AREA WELL THIS WAS ALWAYS THE PLACES WHERE YOU'D HAVE TWO OR THREE U BOATS JUST LURKING HOPING FOR A GOOD KIL AND WHETHER THEY EVER FOUND OUT THAT A SHIP FROM ANY SPYES OR ANYTHING WAS COMING OUT AT THAT TIME I'V NO IDEA BUT THAT WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS PART BECAUSE NONE OF US HAD WORKED TOGETHER WE 'D ALL COME OUT OF TRAINING ADWE'D HAD GOOD TRAINING IN OUR OWN JOBS BUT OF COURSE NOT AS A TANING WERE NOT WITH THE SAME PEOPLE WE WERE TRAINING WITH SO FROM THERE ONWARDS YOUUP FOR HEBRUDESE IT WAS REALLY THE FEW SAILORS EXPERIENCED AND THE OFFICERS OF COURSE YOU WERE EXPERIENCED HAD TO HAVE ALL THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO DO WHAT YOU WERE DOING BECAUSE YOU'D GET NO ESCORT UR SHIP COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN WITH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CREW THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TO SEA BEFORE EVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP BEFORE VERY OFTEN IF WEU'D BEEN ATTACKED AT THAT TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SETT IN DUCK ARRIVED AT SCAPAFLOW WHICH IS RELATIVELY SAFE WE GO THROUGH THE BOOM AGAIN TO GET INTO THE FLOW AND FROM THEN ONWARD DO OUR TRAINING EL THE TRAINING THAT SCAPA FLOW REALLY IS TO GET YOU WORK IN IT AS A TEAM THE WHOLE SHIP HAS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING A GUN CREW FOUR OR FIVE HAS TO KNOW HOW TO WORK TOGETHER IF YOUERE IN THE TRANSMITTING STATION WHICH IS ONE OF THE NURSE CENTRES LIKE WE WERE AS GUNNERY CONTROL YOUUD HAVE ABOUT TEN PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM ITH 'S ONLY THE SIZE OF AN ORDINARY SITTING ROOM AND EACH ONE OF THOSE HAD A JOB TO DO BECAUSE ON A DESTROYER WHICH WE WERE ON WAS A DESTROYER A BRAND NEW RUN AS WELL SO NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO WE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE FIRE CONTROL TABLE AS IT WAS WHERE YOU GOT EIGHT PEOPLE ON IT AALL THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THEY'R TRAINED O SOMETHING SIMMILLAR IN THE TRAINING THEY STILL HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT IF THE SHIPS ATTACKED OR IF WE SHOULD ATTACK ANOTHER SHIP SO THAT WAS WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF US IN THE FLOW TIME WE WERE SO SHORT OF DESTROYERS IN PARTICULAR AND OTHER ESCORT SHIPS SO NOT ONLY WERE WE STAYING IN AN SAFE AREA TO DO OUR TRAINING WE WERE SENT OUT IN HARNESS AS IT WAS CALLED WITH ANOTHER SHIP THAT MIGHT BE MORE EXPERIENCE BUT THOF COURSE THERE 'S ONLY ONE OF YOU THATS EXPERIENCE AND ONE WHICH IS TRAINING WHICH HIS US SOWE LEARNT IT A HARDWAY ALL OUR REAL FIGHTING WAS AROUND THAT TIME AT THE END OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH WAS OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER WAS AROUND THAT AREA SO THEY WOULD SEND US OUT WITH ANOTHER SHIP AND THISIN ONE CASE WE WERE THE ONLY SHIPS THAT WERE IN THE FLOW DESTROYERS AND WE WERE OF COURSE DUTY DESTROYER MS BULLEN WHICH WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AT THAT TIME WAS A SHIP HGT SUNK SO WE WERE SENT OUT AN THOUG NO BASIC TRAINING ON THIS WE HAD A CALL TO GO TO A SHIP OFF CAPE WROTH THAT HAD BEEN SUNK KNOW WHAT HAD BEEN TORPEDOED HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY OUR MESSAGE WAS NOT THAT IT HAD BEEN SUNK A SHIP HAD BEEN TORPEDOED AND TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO GO OUT TO TRY AND HELP TO CATCH THE U BOAT THAT HAD SUNK TO PICK UP SURVIVORS IF THERE WERE ANY THERE SO THERE WAS TWO OF US AND IT SEEMED FROM THE RECORDS I LOOKED UP THE OTHER SHIP THAT WENT OUT WITH US WAS ANOTHER SHIP THAT WAS ALSO WORKING OUT TWO DESTROYERS WITH ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL I HAD TO GO OUT TO THIS SHIP I FOUND OUT LATER IN LIFE IT WAS HMS BULLEN WHICH WAS A ESCORT VESSEL AND THEYAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A U BOAT THE VERY U BOAT THEY'D BEEN LOOKING FOR HIT ONE OF OUR SHIPS FIRST SO MS BULLEND THAT HAD BEEN SUNK AD OTHER SHIPS THAT WERE WITH UR WERE STILL LOOKING FOR THE U BOAT WELL THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS KIPPERWAS VERY KNOWLEGIBLE VERY EXPERIENCED ANHE WENT TO THE POSITION WHEREWHERE THE U BOAT HAD SUNK HMS EDGE OF IS BULLEN NOBODY WAS TOLD ANYTHING HE KNEW IT'S AGMISSIBLE AND NONE OF US WERE TOLD STHE FIRST THING YOU DO YOU GO ROUND DEPTH CHARGE IN THE WHOLE OF THE AREA IN CASE THE U BOAT IS STILL THERE WELL WE PICKED UP AN ECHO TOLD OUR ASDICA OPERATOR HATTHERE WAS SOMETHING DOWN THERE WHICH COULDN'T BE THE U BOAT SO WE DEPTH CHARGED THAT AREA AND APPARENTLY TH ECHO WEDIDN'T MOVE IT STAYED THERE SO WE ASSUMED THAT THAT WAS A U BOAT AND NENEVER CAME UP NEVER GOT ANY OINEVER GOT ANYTHING SO AT THAT TIME OF THE WAR T SNORKE HAD ONLY JUST STARTED SO THEM OUT ALL IN THE WAR NOW THIS U BOAT IF IT DIDNT COME UP WITHIN TWELVE HOURS THEN IT WAS A DEAD DUCK S WE WAITED AROUND THERE ALL NIGHT WITH A BOARDING PARTY READY TO GO ON TO THE U BOAT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME UP FOR ERE IF IT HAD' BEEN AND THEN IT SEEMD WE HAD TO GO ON ANOTHER JOB I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE BUT WE HAD TO GO ON AN ESCORT JOB WE STOOD DOWN THE WHOLE TEAM I WAS LOOKING THIS OF THE NEXT MORNING WE STOOD DOWN THE TEAM OF THE BOARDING PARTY AND IWAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE OF THE SHIP I HAD NO WORK TO DO I WAS OFF WATCH AND I COULD SEE IN THE NEAR DISTANCE A MAGNETIC MINE FLOAT PAST BUNOBODY SHOT AT IT WHICH THEY MIGHT DUNE USUALLY JUST IN CASE THERE WAS A NE BOAT DOWN HE WOULD KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL THERE WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE ALL NIGHT STARTED YOUR ENGINES BCAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT U BOAT IF IT WARE STILL ALIVE THERE DOWN THERE TO KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL UP THERE WAITING SO IN THE END WE WENT BACK TO SCAPAFLOW AND CARRIED ON WITH OUR LEARNING TO FIGHT THA WAR TELL ME ABOUT CHRISTMAS IN SCAPA WELL THIS WAS THIS TT I TOLD YOU ABOUT WAS THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER SMALL JOBS WE MIGHT HAVE DONE THERE I'M NOT SURE BUTTHE NEXT IMPORTANT THING I CAN REMEMBER IS WE WERE NOT REQUIRED FOR WORK AROUND THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD SO WE WERE BACK IN SCAPAFLOW AD IT WAS QUIET AND WE WERE SAFE BUT NONE OF US DHAD U CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME BEFORE THIS AND THERE WE ALL WERE IN A DEAD PLACE SCAPALOW SCAPA FLOW 'S A TERRIBLE PLACE DEAD AS ANYTHING ANWHAT SURPRISED ME WAS ERES TWO HUNDRED ON THE SHIP ROUGHLY TO O HUNDRED SHIPS COMPLIMENT AN LUCKILY WE HADE A FEW AMONGST US THAT WERE EXPERIENCED AND THERE WE WERE THE MESS WERE MAKING CHRISTMAS CAKES WITH WHATEVER STUFF WE COULD GET HOLD OF YOU ALSO MANAGED TO GET SURE WHERE FROM A CHRISTMAS TREE FOR SOMEWHERE AND THAT IS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE MAST ON THE TOP OF EVERY SHIP AT CHRISTMAS TIME OF THEY'RE IN HARBOUR THEY HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE WHICH IS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE SHIP ADWE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED I THNK BY THE OFFICERS BEING CHRISTMAS BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER WE WERE OR NOT A YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE DRINK ONBOARD IT'S A DRY SHIP AT SOME OF THE OLD STAGES THATHAD SAVED SOME OF THEIR RUM RATION WHICH YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO VERY BAD VERY HIGH CHARGE AS YOU WERE CAUGHT BUT THE OFFICERS NORMALLY ON A SMALL SHIP LIKE A DESTROYER CLOSE YOUR EYES TO LOTS OF TH THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO IF THEY WERE ON A BIG SHIP THAT YOU CALL A PUSSE SHIP SO MANY OF THE LADS THAT WERE ALLOWED RUM I WASN'T BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO RUM UNTIL YOU'RE TWENTY AND I WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN BUT OUT CAME THE RUM RUSION ORRIBLE I HATE IT AND U MADE UP THINGS OUT OF PAPER I THIKPACKAGING PAPER RED GREEN AND BLUE CAME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES OUT OF HIDY HOLES ANDMADE INTO DECORATIONS AND WE WERE MOORED AT A BOY THERE AT THE TIME ASINGING CHRISTMAS SONGS SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAD INSTRUMENTS WE HAD A SMALL BAND ON BOARD SOME OF THE PEOPLE I SOSE SOME OF OUR LADS WHO COME FROM HOMES THAT D NEVER ITBAD IIT WAS VERY THEARFUL FOR HEM I CAME FROM HOME THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY SO CHRISTMAS WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FOR ME SO ANYWAY WE ALL ENJOYED OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME AND OU KNOW LISCAPAFLOW THAT WAS QUITE G COMMANDER WILKINSON WAS R CAPTAIN AEVERYBODY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A LIFE FOR HIM REALLY AFTER WE'D BEEN WIT HIM FOR A TIME ECAUSE ALTHOUGH HE WAS VERY STRICT HE WAS QUITE HAPVY TO ATURNHI HE WAS A LAD THE SAME A US LATER ONIN THE STORY WHEN WE GOT AT FAR EAST I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT WE HAD MULTIPOLO TEAMS AND HE WAS ON THE TEAM WITH THE LADS AGAINST THE OFFICERS AND THAT WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON HE WOULD BE AND HE WAS I K BOXING CHAMPION OF THE FLEET OR PART OF THE FLEET AND HE WAS SUCH A NICE PERSON YU KNOWAND THERE IS ANOTHER CASE I'LL TELL U TELL YOU IN A LITTLE WHILE WHEN I GO ASHORE SOBUT THE NEXT THING WE WENT ON AFTER CHRISTMAS AFTER CHRISTMAS WAS WHEN WE REALLY STARTED LEARNING THAT THERE WAS A WAR ON WE WOULD STILL GO OUT AWOULD STILL GO OUT AS A SHIP WORKING UP TOGETHER BUT THE FIRST ONE WE WENT OUT WITH I BELIEVE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND THIS WAS TO BE A STRIKE AGAINST NORWAY WE DIDN'T KNOW TIL WE WERE AT SEA DOING THIS BUT THERE WAS THESE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS SOME MORE DESTROYERS I AND OTHER SHIPS NWAIR JOB WAS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT ONE OF THE CARRIERS BUT IT WAS ALSO TO ACT AS A LIFEBOAT REALLY WHEN THE AIRCRAFT TOOK OFF AND IA COUPLE OF THESE WERE OLD TYP AIRCRAFT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF THEY WERE BIPLANES NOW THIS WAS A REALLY ROUGH DAY AND THEY TOOK OFI WATCHED THEM I WASN'T ON WATCH ALL THE TIME AND I WATCHED THEM FROM THE DECK AND THE CARRIER WAS BOUNCING UP AND DOWN BUT THEY TOOK OFF ANDI THK THEY CARRIED OUT OR TRIED TO CARRY OUT THEIR TASK BUT THE TWO ISHAR COME BACK DIDN'T MAKE IT AUSE THE SHIP WAS DANCING UP AND DOWN THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER DANCING UP AND DOWN AND I BELIEVE ONE OF THEM HIT THE DECK PUSHOVERBOARD THAT'S WITH THE PEOPLE IN IT THEY CAN'T TAKE THEM OUT PUSHED THEM OVERBER TO MAKE WAY FOR ANOTHER ONE LANDING AND THE OTHER ONE DISAPPEARED I THINK HE WAS GIVEN ORDERS TO TRY AND FLY BACK TO HIS BASE OR A BASE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH TO LAND ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER WE I THIT BEING CRASH BOAT A WAS CALLED WE WENT TO TRY AND FIND THE AIRCRAFT THAT WAS DITCHED SAD OR NO AIRCRAFT SO ANYWAY I HK THEY HAD TO CALL OFF CAUSE IT WAS JUST TOO TOO DANGEROUS TO DO ANY MORE FLYING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT WAS REALLY A BAD BEGINNING MY WAR WE WENT BACK TO SCAPAY TALK ABOUT IT BEING ROUGH HOW WERE YOUR SEA LEGS TERRIBLE I WAS SEA SICK MOST TIMES I WENT TO SEA BUT WEWHEN YOUWHEN YOU WERE ON LOOKOUT OR WHEN YOU'ERE IN THE TS WHICH IS I KAM THE TS IS DOWN BELOW AND THAT IS THE TRANSMITTING STATION THAT TAKES THE A RELAY FROM THE DIRECTOR TOWER WHICH IS RIGHT UP AT THE TOP OF THE SHIP THROUGH U INATS TO THE MAIN ARMAMENT WHICH IS FOUR FOUR INCH GUNS SO I WAS A COMMUNICATION NUMBER SO THE DIRECTOR WOULD SPEAK TO ME THE OFFICER TWO OFFIC ERS IN THE IDIRECTOR WOULD BE SPEAKING TO ME AND I WOULD BE SPEAKING TO THE GUNS BUT APART FROM THAT THE DIRECTOR WOULD HAD INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD SEND SIGNALS DOWN TO OUR BIG PTER THE ORIGINAL MECHANICAL COMPUTER AND THE MECHANICAL COMPUTER WE'D SEND THAT INFORMATION MECHANICALLY TO THE GUNS BUT ONCE I GOT INTO A POSITION WHERE THERE WAS EXCITEMENT I FOR GOT ALL ABOUT SEA SICKNESS I WA O THAT WAS A GOOD THING BUT NORMALLY IF I WASN'T ON ONE WATCH IW STANDING I'D BE STANDING ON THE UPPER DECK WATCHING THE SEA HEAVING UP AND DOWN AND BESICK THE ONLY TIME YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS IS WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING ACTION YOU KNOW LATER ON TALK ABOUT THE MINELAYING WE WERE AT ACTION STATIONS ALL THE TIME BUT IF YOU'RE DOING A JOB JUST ESCORTING THEYOU'RE AT CRUISING STATIONS UNTIL SOME TROUBLE POPS UP AGING U BOATS IS NOT A CASE OF GOING TO ACTION STATIONS IT'S ONLY IF TU BOAT FIGHTS BACK THEN YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS SO ANYWAY WE WENT FROM THERE BACK TO SCAPA FLOW I THINK WE DID ONE OR TWO JOURNEYS LIKE THIS OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN FORTY FIVE EVENTUALLY WE SUPPOSEDLY FINISHED OUR TRAINING OF WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM MIND YOU ALL THIS TIME I'M TALKING TO YOU ABOUT NOW WE WERE STILL LEARNING BECAUSE WE WERE STILL TEAMING UP WITH PEOPLE THAT WE NEVER WORKED WITH BEFORE IF WE'D RUN INTO ANY REAL TROUBLE AT THAT TIME WE WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD A LOT OF CHANCE IT WASTIL LATER ON WHEN WE AD LEARNT THESE THINGS SO THE NEXT ONE I THIK IS AN IMPORTANT ONE IS IN ABOUT FEBRUARY I BELIEVE WERE JUST TOLD WE WERE GOING OUT I THAT NIGHT WE WERE NOT GIVING ANY REAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE WE WERE GOING OR WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO BUT IT WAS A VERY BIG DO THERE WAS A VERY LARGE FORCE WE LEFT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT I BELIEVE IS THIS THAT TE FIRT SCAPA THIS IS OUTO SCAPA AND THISTHIS IS WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE MINE LAYN OPERATION IT WAS A VERY ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO MOON IT WAS ALL STARLIGHT IT WAS VERY GOOD VISIBILITY AND IT WAS A VERY CALM NIGHT STRANGENOUGH HARDLY ANY ROUGH SEA OR ANYTHING WE SET OUT ANDOFYOU SELDOM KNOW WHO'S WITH YOU ITW'S THE SILENCE SERVICE YOU'RE NOT TOLD ANYTHING AWE'D BEEN ABOUT OUT AHOUR I BELIEVE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AND THE SKIPPER THEN SAID OVER TE TURNOY WHAT WE WAS GOING TO DO HE'D PEN HIS ORDERS AND HE TOLD US WE WERE A BIG FORCE ONE OF THE LARGE FORCE WERE GOING DOWN THE SOUTHERN PART OF NORWAY TO EGESUND AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY WE WERE JUST ONE OF TWO SHIPS THE OTHER ONE WAS EZELIUS SAME SIZE OF THE SAME DESTROYER AS WE WERE AND OUR MAIN TASK WE HAD TO ESCORT THIS MINELAYER HS OPOLLO FIRST OF ALL BOTH FORCES WORKING TOGETHER HAD TO PASS THROUGH A BIG MINE FIELD THERE WAS A BIG MINE FIELD THATWAS LAID IK BY US AND WE HAD TO GO THROUGH ONE PATH FOR IT WHICH WAS THE ONLY PATH THROUGH IT BUT WE KNEW WHERE THE OPENING WAS SO IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE ENOUGH BUT YOU DO GET LOOSE MINES SO OUR ASDEC OPERATOR HAD TO PICK OUT THE MNES THE AND I WAS ON WATCH AT ONE TIME AND I COULD HEHEAR HIM SAY HATTHERE'S SOMETHING ON THE PORT SIDE AND THE CAPTAIN WOULD MOVE THE SHIP OVER A BIT SO ANYWAY WE THE MINE FIELD ALL OF US ER NO REAL PROBLEM AND THEN WE SPLIT UP WE WERE TO WAIT TIL TWELVE O'CLOCK AAT THAT TIME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE OTHER BIG FORCE WE WERE BY THE WAY UPDAVAA AT THAT POINT ANTHE OTHER BIG FORCE WAS TWO CRUISERS I THINK AD NO AIRCRAFTCARRIED AT THAT POINT AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY GECONVOY THAT WAS GOING TO LEAVE EGASAND WAS GOING TO HUNETHE COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO STUVANGA WHERE WE WERE THE OTHER FORCS TO STOP A GETTING THERE SO DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK THE OTHER FORCE WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE CONVOY AND THEY WERE HOPING IN THAT WHEN THAT STARTED THERE WOULD BE LOTS OF FIREWORKS DOWN FURTHER ALONG THE COAST IT WAS QUITE A FEW HUNDRED MILES BUT THAT WOULD TAKE THE HEAT OFF WHAT WE WERE DOING A CLANDESTINE OPERATION WE WERE TESCORT THE APOLLO TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WAS GOING TO START LAYING MINES DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK AND WE WERE TO BE BETWEEN HER AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND IFSHE WAS SIGHTED ON BY THE GERMANS OR PICKED UP BY RADAR BY THE GERMANS AND THEY WERE TO START FIRING WE WERE TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS WE COULD UP AND DOWN THE BIT OF SEA BETWEEN US AND BETWEEN THE APOLLO AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND USE ALL THE GUNS AND FLARES AND EVERYTHING T YOU COULD TO TAKE THE HEAT OFF HER SO THEY WOUD ATTACK US SO THE APOLLO WOULD HAV EITHER FLUSHED US OR INDICATED TO US OR NOT ON THE SHORE BECAUSE YOU COULD GIVE HAD TO KEEP RADIO SILENCE AD WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO SMOKE SHOW ANYTHING YOU WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TE BANG BECAUSE THE NOISE WE WERE NOT FAR AWAY FROM THE COAST O TO AND BUT THE SHIPS BOTH US AND THE OTHER ESCORT DESTROYERS LIUS HAD TO KEEP UP AS MUCH STEAM AS WE COULD BECAUSE IF THE FIREWORKS STARTED WE WERE TO HAVE TO SPEED RUSH UP AND DOWN THIS BIT OF COAST FIRING WHATEVER WE COULD TO PREVENT TESTHE APOLLO WELL I COULD HEAR FROM THE GUNS BECAUSE I WAS IN THE TS AND FROM THE DIRECTOR A TARTED DOING ANYTHING AND I COULD HEAR THE PEOPLE IF TA GUN SAYING WELL I I SEE THE HEAD LIGHTS THERE THEY'RE JUST JST OVER THERE A LITTLE BIT HE CA COMING DOWN GOING FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT AND I COULD HEAR ALL THIS THEY SAY OP THEY CAN'T SEE US FROM WHETHER THEY ARE AND THEN HE SAID RIGHT THEY'VE STARTED DOWN THE OTHER END AND THEY STARTED FIRING DOWN AT THE OTHER END THEY ATTACKED THIS CONVOY AND THEY WERE BENYOU COULDN'T SEE OTE WE COULDN'T I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHIG ANYWAY BECAUSE I WAS DOWN IN THE TS UT WAS GETTING ALL THE MESSAGES FROM NOT THE TWO OFFICERS UP IN THE TOWER BUT FROM MY MATES ON A GUN BGUN X GUN AND W GUN THEY WERE FUNDLLING NG ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE ME SAYD LOK I THINK THAT BLES SMOKING OVER THERE YOU KNO ON THAT OTHEY CAN'T SEE US ANYWAY APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO MUCH SO WE WERE SLOWLY CRUISING UP AND DOWN AT APOLLO STARTED LAYING OR MINES AD ON TIME DED ON TWELVE O'CLOCK THE MINE LAYER IT'S A BIG MINE LAYER OF MINES A BIG CRUISER THEY ARE AND ONCE THEY START LAYING TE MINE AND THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME IN THEY CAN'T STOP THEY'VE GOT TO DO THE WHOLE OF THEIR MINE LAYING BECAUSE THE MINE FO'S BEING LAID SO THEY CAN'T TURN BACK THEY CAN ONLY GO ON AND CARRY ON LAYING THEIR MINES SO ANYWAY WE'RE JUST GOING SLOWLY UP AND DOWN ABECAUSE OUR SHIP WAS KEEPING STEAM UP READY FOR A QUICK DASH UP AND DOWN THE VALVE BLEW GOT A NORMAL IS A WELL KNOWN DESTROYER WHOOT WH WHOOP WHOO WHICH WEUD DO EVERY TIME YOU COME IN AND OUT OF HARBOUR JUT TO SIGNAL AD APPARENTLY EVERYBODY WENT MAD THE CRUISER WEREN'T MAD I WAS IN SILENT ROUTINE YOU KNOW D THE FACT THAT WE WERE NEVER SUSED OUT NOT TO THE VERY END AND I THINK IT MIGHT EVEN BE IF ANYBODY AD HEARD THAT WHOOP WHICH AS A WELL KNOWN BRITISH DESTROYER SIGNALLED TO SAY YOU KNOW 'M COMEING INTO HRBOUR OR SOMEWHERE TUT YOUKNOW E CAN'T BE A BRITISH DESTROYER NOT BEING HIS DAHT ENOUGH TO DO A THING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW SO ANYWAY THEY LAID THEY LAID THE MINES AND THEN WE KNEW I DON'T KNOW BY SIGNAL OR WHAT SHE SAID ALL DONE O KWE CARRIED OUT OURMISSION SEE YOU BACK IN PORT AND I WAS AT THAT TIME LISTENING TO SOME OF THE MI AND THEY WERE SAYING LOOK AT ER MOVE AND SHE WAS DOING FORTY KNOTS SHE WAS ONE OF THE FASTEST SHIPS THERE WERE AND THEY COULD SEE BOWWAVE IS NIGHT BUT IT WAS STARLIGHT AND YOU COULD SEE YOU COULD SEE THE SHORE YOU COULD SEE THE PLACE WHERE THE GUNS WERE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A CRACK AT US AS THEY'D KNOWN AND AWAY WENT THE OPOLLO AND AT SPEED AND WE TURNED AROUND BUT WE WENT AS FAR AS YOU COULD BU WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO AT AGOOD SPEED BECAUSE WE GOT A SIGNAL THAT THE GERMANS USD OUT THAT THEY WERE BEING ATTACKED ESPECIALLY FROMEGASUND WITH THE BATTLE WE HAD ON DOWN NER AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE AFTERWARDS ON THE APOLLO WHEN ITOUCH OF THEM THEY SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD AND THEY WERE IN THE WHIE IT' AD E TELEGRAPHES OFFICE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT WEAD BEEN CHALLENGED ALTHOUGH FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BECAUSE THEY HAD PICKED US UP ON RADAR THE FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED AND HE THINKS THAT THE M OLO WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF COURSE HAD GIVEN THE RIGHT CHALLENGE ANSWER BUT THEN THEY CHALLENGED AGAIN LATER ON AND DIDN'T BECAUSE THE APOLLO HAD STARTED DISAPPEARING SO THEY SENT TORPEDO BOMBERS AFTER US AND THEY NEVER FOUND US SO WE GOT BACK O SO THE MND BEN SUCCESSFUL OU FORCE DOWN FURTHER INKASAND EGASAND HAD STOPPED THE CONVOY GOING UP THE GERMAN CONVOY THEY'D SUNK ONE OR TWO OF THE SHIPS AONE OR TWO OF OUR SHIPS HAD INJURED PEOPLE BUT THE WHOLE MISSION WAS SUCCESSFUL IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU WERE EXPENDIBLE WHEN YOU WERE OUT THERE YEH WITH THE APOLOWASI WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE DESTROYER WAS A VALUABLE BIT OF KIT TALK A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF DESTROYER AND IT'S CONFORABLES BECAUSE WWHAT I SHALL BRING IN IS BECAUSE LATER ON WHEN THE END OF THE WAR WHICH IT WON'T BE AN LAT ONE WHEN WE WERE A BIG FORCE ESCORTING SOME OF THE CRUISERS OUT TO THE FAR EAST WE ONLY TOOK THEM AS FARS GIBRALTAR YOU SEE AND THEN ANOTHER FORCE TAKES OVER BUT WE WERE ESCORTING A BATTLESHIP THE RENOWN AND WE WERE THE CLOSE ESCORT ONE DESTROYER EACH SIDE FAIRLY CLOSE WHEREAS OTHERS WERE FURTHER OUT AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY LIKE THIS AND I WASN'T ON MY J JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE BUT WE WERE CLOSE BECAUSE O A CLOSE ESCORT YOU SEE AND I'M JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE AND OVER THE TANNO COMES TA VOICE FROM THE CAPTAIN WE'RE NOW REACHING A DANGEROUS AREA AND THERE MIGHT BE OU BOATS AROUND IF A U BOAT HAS FIRED A TORPEDO AND THAT IS AND WHAT AS IT WE SEE T TRACK OF THAT TORPEDO HEADING TOWARD BIG CISTER WHICH THEY CALLED THE RENOWN THEN WE STOP IT DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE MEAN OPIT AND THERE'S ME LOOKING OVER THE SIDE LOOKING AT THE TORPEDO BULGE ON THE RENOWN AND THINKING TO YOURSELF YES YOU'RE GING TO LOSE TWO HUNDRED MEN JUST ASA TORPEDO BENDING LITTLE TORPEDO BULGE YO KNOW JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF A DESTROYER L ROLLE OFMOST DESTROYERS IS THERE FAST MANVERABLE AND THEY'RE LIKE A SMALLERTON OF A CRUISER THEY HAVE ALTHER GUNNERY BUT SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'VE GOT FOUR BIG GUNS FOUR PT FIVE G GUNS OTHER SMALLER GUNS SO THEYVE GOT ALL THOSE THE ONE THING THEY'VE GOT EXTRA APART FROM THE SMALLER SIDE SCALE DOWN THE BIG SHIPS HAVE NOT GOT ANTI SUBMARINE EQUIPMENT THEY'VE GOT TORPEDOES AND THINGS BUT UNLESS THEY'RE SUBMARINES ON THE SURFACE THEY'VE GOT NO DEPTH CHARGES OA DESTROYER HAS DEPTH CHARGES SO WE'RE THERE BU ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIFFERENCE THE REASON WHY YOU GOT THE DESTROYER AS WELL IS JUST AS I SAID IF THE CAPITAL SHIP OR WHAIS YOU'RE GUARDING IS TORPEDOED THE LAST RESULT IS YOU GETTING IN THE WAY OF THE TORPEDO TE LOSE A SHIP THAT' ONLY GOT TWO TWO HUNDRED MEN ON BOARD THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MEN ON THE BATTLESHIP REMOTE AS IT MIGHT BE IF IT GOT A TORPEDO BULGE AND THIS IS WHY WE SHOT OF SOR OF DESTROYERS BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM GET LOST BECAUSE THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN A TORPEDO IS SIGHTED IS TO GO TO ATTACK THE SUBMARINE THAT FIRED IT BE NEAR ENOUGH TO GET IN THE WAY OF A TORPEDO IF IT HAPPENS TO BE HEADING YOUR WAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALKED A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WERENT ATEAND YOU WERE VERY YOUNG CREW WAS THERE A MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE ON BOARD WHEN YOU THOUGHT WERE WORKING BRILLIANTLY KNOWN WELL NOT REALLY YOU JUST SORT OF FIT IN PART OF LIFE YOU MANAGED TO FIT INTO EVERY SITUATION IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH AND I'S NEVER WORRIED BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD SWIMMER YOU MUST BE AA EVEN IF THE SHIP SINKS THEN WHWHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU SPEAK TO OTHER PEOPLE YOU'VE GOT SEA BOOTS ON AT THE TIME YOU HAVE AA BELT WHICH SHOULD SHAVE YOU WHICH YOU WEAR ALL THE TIME AT SEA BUT YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT BELT BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT GETS IN THE WAY OF YOUR ARMS AND EVERYTHING O WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU HAVE TO JUMP INTO THE HOGGING AS THEY CALL IT THE SEA MUSTN'T BE BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT MIGHT BREAK YOUR ARMS SO YOUW'RE EXPECTED TO BLOW THAT UP WHEN YOU HIT THE SEA AND I CAN'T SEY HOW YOU GET LUCKILY I NEVER HAD TO BUT I HAVE SURVIVORS THAT HAVE TOLD ME YES I HAD TO BLOW IT UP AS SOON AS I HIT THE WATER AND I HAD NO BREATH AT ALL LEFT SO I COULDN'T BLOW IT UP SEABOATS DRAGG OUT OUT BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE WEARING IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGSWHAT'S THE NEXT BIG EVENT THAT YOU RECALL THEM WELL IT WAS REALLY MUNDANE MOST OF THE THINGS EVEN AS ESCORT TO THE MONSTERS THAT WE DID YOUR ENEMY IN MOST CASES WAS SEA BATTERED LET RIGHT AND CENTRE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH QUEEN MARY AND QUEEN ELIZABETH BECAUSE AS WE TOOK THEM OUT OF THE CLYDE WE ZIGJAGGED ALL THE WAY WITH THEM AND WE KEPT UP WITH THEM TIL THEY REACHED THEIR TOP SPEED WHICH WAS TE DISTAN A FURTHER OF THE WAY ACROSS AND THEN WE LEFT THEM AND WE EITHER WAITED AROUND FOR THE NEXT ONE COMING IN WE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN H QUEEN MARY OUT AND MIGHT HAVE HAD TO WAIT JUST A FEW HOURS FOR QUEEN ELIZABETH TO COME IN AND ALL THE TIME ONE OF YOU MIGHT PICK UP ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU AS THO QUEEN MARY WOULD HAVE ITS OWN ASDIC BESIDES ITS OWN RADAR AND WE OF COURSE WERE AT THE ASDIC AND THE RADAR AND OUR COHORT PERHAPS THE CAVALIER WOULD BE THE SAME WELLWHEN WE'D STEAM OUT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE APART AT THE EXTREMES OF YOU ASDIC CIRCLE RADAR CIRCLE SO YOU DIDN'T INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHER'S RECET FTHE WAVE AND IF WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUBMARINE OU MIGHT HAVE BEEN A WRECK WELL IMMEDIATELY WE'D RUN UP A BLACK FLAG ON OUR FLAG DECK SO E QUEEN MARY WOULD KNOW AND THE'LL SOTHE CAVALIER WOULD KNOW THAT WE' PICKED UP AN ECHO IMMEDIATELY WE'D HIVE OFF TO ATTACK THE ECHO THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE IN TROUBLE IF IT IS IF THAT'S AU BOAT IT MIGHT HAVE ALREADY FIRED ITS TORPEDO IS WHERE YOU TURN OFF SWIFTLY AT FULL SPEED IF YOU CAN IF YOU' GOT A BEAM SEA YOU CATURN OFF LEFT AR RIGHT U HIT WITH A BEAM SA THE DESTROYER YOU GOT HARDLY ANY DRAFT YOU'D TURN OVER STRAIGHT AWAY SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY VER CATE YOU NEVER DID WHENEVER ITS LUCK OR S BY JUDGMENT I I DON KNOW BUT ANYWAY THEN IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HIT BY A TORPEDO THEN YOU'D FIND YOUR WAY TO WHEREVER THAT ECHO WAS AND YOU WOULD ATTACK THE ECHO SO YOU'D LOOSE OFF ABOUT DEPTH CHARGES FROM ONE SIDE T FROM THE OTHER AND ROLL OFF OF THE TWO RECKS FROM THE REAR SO PATTEN HIM ABOUT TEN CHARGES WELL IF THE U BOAT IS A VERY EXPERIENCED ONE AND HE WAS WATCHING YOU ON THE PERESCOPE HE WOULDN'T BE THERE WHEN YOU ARRIVED HE WOULD EITHER HAVE GONE DOWN LOW OR HE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BUT AT LEAST YOU KEPT HIM DOWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM HITTING YOUR CHARGE AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO TRY TO CATCH IT UP HALF A DAY BECAUSE THEY'RE KEEPING THE SAME SPEED EVEN IF THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO LEAVE T QUEEN MARY OR T QUEEN ELIZABETH QUEEN MARY WOULD CARRY ON IT WOULDN'T STOP AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY'D ACTUALLY TORPEDOED TO QUEEN MARY THEN THEY WOULD HAVE LOST A LOT OF LIVES BECAUSE WHILE R QUEEN MARY'S IF IT'S COMING BACK IN YOU'LL HAVE AFULL COMPLIMENT OF AMERICAN GS AND THAT WOULD BE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND CARRYING NOW THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TIGHTEN UP THEIR WATERTIGHT DOORS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING FROM THE DIFFERENT DECKS ALL THE TIME IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF WE GO INTO ACTION STATIONS THEN WE CLOSE OUR WATERTIGHT DOORS WHICH MEANS IF YOU'R TORPEDO OR MINED IT WILL ONLY DAMAGE THE COMPARTMENT WHEO'RE WITHIN SO THE SHIP MOST LIKELY WON'T SINK IT'S ON THE QUEEN MARY THER THEY'VE GOT NO CHANCE OF ANY OF THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BEING CLOSED BECAUSE THEY'RE TRAVELLING BETWEEN THE DIFRENTDIT DECKS THEY'RE PERHAPS SLEEPING ON ONE DECK TRAVELLING UP THE NEXT DECK TO EAT FOOD ANOTHER DECK FOR EXERCISE AN THE DECK IS AWAYS EXERCISE SO YHEY COULDN'T AVE CLOSED HE CREW WATE FIGHT DOORS ANY OF THOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISASTERS YOU WOULD FIND WHAT WAS IT LIKE SEEING A QUEEN MARY THE QUEEN ELIZABETH THE SAILING ONEDID YOU HAVE ANY PRID WERE THEN SHIPS THAT YOU KNEW OF AND WERE PROUD OF ANYWHERE ALL WE REALLY KNEW WAS THAT WE WARE GOING TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS OR BRING ONE OF THE MONSTERS IN IF IT WAS THE QUEEN MARY AND WE WERE IN GREENOCK THEN WE WOULD KNOW ITS THE GT COMIN WHERE WE WERE TAKEN OUT AND THAT'S ALWAYS GOT THREE FUNNELS ANYWAY IF WE PICKED UP IF IT'S GOT THREE FUNNELS IT'S T QUEEN MARY IT'S OT TWO FUNNELS IT'S QUEEN ELIZABETH AND SO ON YOU GOT FOUR FUNNELS WITH THE AQUITANIA AND SO IT WENT ON BUT YOU WERE NEVER TOLD YOU WERE JUST OUT AND GO TO A RNDEVOT WHERE YOUOUD WAIT AROUND OR YOU'D ALREADY CONTACTED THAT SHIP TO SAY YOU'RE THERE AN YOU'D BRING IT IN VERY OFTEN EVEN WE TWO WERE ESCORTS ONE WOULD BE AT GREENOK AT THE CLYDE AND THE OTHER WOULD BE DOWN AT LIVERPOOL ANDWE WOULD REACH A POINT OF RENDEVOOT GOING OUT OF THE CLYDE THE OTHER ONE THE CAVALIER PERHAPS COME OUT O LIVERPOOL THEN WE'D STEAM UP TOGETHER TO RONDEVOO POINT FOTHE MONSTER THIS HAPPEND ALMOST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK OR ONE OR OTHER OF US WE NEVER HAD THE SAME COHORT BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T ALWAYS BE IN THE SAME AREA THEY'D BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE AND BETWEEN THAT IF YOU'R A DUTY SHIP THERE WAS AICRAFT CARRIER WHICH HAPPENED IN ONE CASE HAD BEEN TORPEDOD WE'D JUST COME DOWN FROM SCAPA TO TO GREENOCK AWED JUST ARRIVED AT THE HARBOUR ENTRANCE WE WENT STRAIGHT TO AN OILER BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVED TO FILL UP WITH OIL BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO OUT AND JUST AS WE WERE AT THE OILER WE GOT AN EMERGENCY CALL TO SAY THAT AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER HAD BEEN TORPEDOED JUST IN CLYDE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CLYDE SO WE JUST THE OILER AND WE WENT STRAIGHT OUT TO THE THANG IT WAS AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND STRANGELY ENOUGH SHE WAS ON HER OWN SHEAD COME FROM LONDERRY SHED HAD NO ESCORT LUCKILY SHE DIDN'T HAVE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF SEAMAN AND SO FORTH AND SHE WASD COME INTO TO THE CLYDE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY TORPEDOED TAT THE TORPEDOED A MERCHANT SHIP AT THE SAME TIME AND THE U BOAT GOT AWAY ALTHOUGH WE WENT TO ATTACK IT DIT WAS DARK AND E HOTHERS I THIK LOOKING FOR THE U BOAT AFTERWARDS WHERE WE CAE GOING BACK INTO HARBOUR HOW LONG ARE YOU AT SEA WHEN YOU WERE OUT IN THE ATLANTIC HOW OFTEN ARE YOU GOING BACK TO BASE AND GETTING LANDLOT I A DESTROYER NOT VERY LONG BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT MUCH FUEL AND THERE'S ALWAYS TOP SPEED ALWAYS MANEUVERING YOUR ON WAY OF GETTING FUEL IF YOU'RE OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS FROM ONE OF THE BIGGER SHIPS EITHER FROM AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER OR SOMETHINGTH AS BIG AS A BELFAST A CRUISER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ALSO FOOD YOUR FOOD RUNS OUT AFTER A SHORT WHILE S THE ONLY TIME WE WERE REALLY OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS WHEN WE'RE UP AT SCAPA WHEN YO WORKING UP WHEN WE WASE GOING OUT ON FOREAIDS TO HELP TO SINK THE TIP TURPITS OR DOING OTHER JOBS MOST OF THE OTHERS IT WAS A CASE OF GOING OUT JUST FOR A DAY OR TWO TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS AND THEN COME BACK WITH THE MONSTER OR TAKE ONE OUT AND LEAVE IT IN WHICH CASE YOE'D HAVE TO GO TO LONDON DERRY PERHAPS AND THEN D COME OUT OF LONDON DERRY AGAIN ANOU KGO OUT ON THAT SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT RESPECT TAT WE WERE NOT OUT FOR VERY LONG THERE WAS ONLY ONE OCCASION WHEN WAS OUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME IT MUST HAVE BEEN OVER THE FIVE DAYS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE OCCASION WAS WE HAD RUNE OUT OF FOOD DWE WAS FURTHER UP IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC OUR CAPTAIN WAS A X FISHERY FLEET MAN HE HAD HIS OWN FISHERY FLEET THEN SO WHAT HE DECIDED TO DO AS WE WR RUN OUT OF FOOD HE SAID I KNOW WHERE THE FISH ARE HE GUIDED THE SHIP UP TO WHERE HE KNEW THEY WERE PICKED UP A SHO ON THE RADAR ON THE ASDEC DROPPED AT A DEPTH CHARGE LOWERED THE BOAT PICKED UP AA THE FISH THAT CAME UP TIT WAS STUNNED E STOOD ON THE FOKSL WE SAW HIM SET ON THE FOKSL AND SAID PICK UP MY MIND PICKED THE IS ONE WE LIVED ON FISH FOR A FEW MORARE DAYS AFTER THAT ONE VIGER OUR RUNS WERE MOSTLY JUST ABOUT FIVE DAYS AT A TIME BUT THAT MEANT EVERY TIME WE CAME INTO HEITHER SCAPA O IF WE WERE IN LIVERPOOL OR TO THE CLYDE WE HAD TO ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF FUEL ON BOARD BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A DAO DUTY DESTROYER AND THEN IF SOMETHING COMES UP WHERE E SHIP'S BEEN SUNK YOU HAVE TO GO OUT STRAIGHT AWAY AND YOU MIGHT BE OUT FOR A LONG TIME R A SUBMARINE OR OR THN ON SUBMARINE WE WERE LUCKY IN THE FACT THAT WE NEVER WENT OUT FOR A LONG TIME OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OIL IN AT SEA WHICH IS A DANGEROUS PRACTICE ANYWAY D PICKING UP FOOD AND EVERYTHING FR FROM IT CAN YOU DESCRIBE RADAR YES THIS IS GOE JOB YOU WERE DOING RADAR YES RADIAR D WELL FIRST OF AL WHEN I WAS ON THE RADAR SET IT WAS ONLY A SMALL SET AND IT TYPES THE TWO NINE THREE TIS HIGH UP ON HA MAST SPECIALLY FOR PICKING UP AIRCRAFT OR SURFACE SHIPS RALL ADISTANCE I CA CAN'T THINK OF TA RANGE OF IT BUT IT SENDS OUT A SIGNAL FROM THERE WHICH OF COURSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT ANYTHING YOU DON'T GET IT BACK TIF IT HITS ANYTHING EVEN CLIFFS OR AN AIRCRAFT OR SURFCE SHIP T IT BAANCES BACK AON THE SCREEN WHICH IS AROUND SCREEN ADTHE CURSER IS GOING ROUND ALL THE TIME THAT WILL SHOW A BLE AND THAT BLIP YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S A CLOUD WHICH IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE DEPEND ON YOUR ADAR WHAT IT'S DOING VERTICAL OR ANGLAR AD YOU WILL THEN READ OFF THE DISTANCE AND THE ANGLE OF EVERYTHING THIS IS MOSTLY ON A LEVEL BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER SCREAM WHICH GIVES YOU THE HEIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT SOYOU USE ONE WITH THE OTHER WHEN THAT SIGNAL ELECTRONIC SIGNAL HITS ANYTHING THEN IT RETURNS AND THEN YOU READ OFF THE DISTANCE OF IT BUTIS IT EASY TO USE IT'S EASIER TO USE WHERE YOU FIND A DIFFICULTY IS BY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT EITHER LAND BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF IT ON THERE OR IF IT'S A SMALL BLIP IT'S AN AIRCRAFT A SHIP OR WHATEVER IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE USING ONE TYPE OF RADAR IT'S ONLY ONLY HORIZONTAL IF YOU'RE USING ANOTHER ONE IT CAN BE HORIZONTAL OR AN AIRCRAFT AND YOU A GOOD DISTANCE THE TIME IT TAKES OF COURSE IT'S BASED ONIF IT TAKES TEN SECONDS TO GET FROM THERE TO THERE THEN I'S READ IT OFF FROM THE SQUEEN LUCKILY AT OUR POINT IN THE WAR WE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH AIRCRAFT THE ONLY TIME WE WOULD HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THAT IS IF THE TORPEDO BOMBERS HAD BEEN SENT AFTER US OFF NORWAY THEN WOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO USE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD KNOW THE A WE'D HAVE TO USE THE TWO RADAR SETS THEN THE ONE THAC GIVES YOU A SIGNAL I THE HEIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT AND THE OTHER ONE WHICH GIVES YOU DISTANCE OF IT TEN YOU'RE TRAINED TO KNOW WHICH THE DIFFERENCE AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT ICAN REMEMBER IF IT WAS ONE OF OUR OWN AIRCRAFT IT WOULD HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION SIGNAL WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW ON YOUR RADAR SET BEFORE ITGOT TO YOU SO YOU'D HAVE TO BA PRETTY WELL EXPERIENCED BUT MY TIME WAS NOT ALWAYS ON A RADAR SAT YOU WERE SOMETIMES ON A LOOKOUT AS A SEAMAN WHERE YOURE SITTING UP IN A LOOKOUT BOX ON THE STARBOARD SIDE WAS MINE AND YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR AIRCRAFT WHICH WAS NOT VERY OFTEN O SURFACE SHIPS OR MORE THAN LIKELY YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR A LITTLE TINY PERISCOPE WHICH IS VERY HARD TO SEE IN A ROUGHER ATLANTIC OR YOU MIGHT BE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE THE TRACK OF A TORPEDO COMING TOWARD YOU IN WHICH CASE YOU GET INTO A PANIC AND CALL OUT QUICKLY TO THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE HE CAPTAIN OR OFFICER OF THE WATCH AT THE TIME IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE IT'S ENCLOSED BUT IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE SO THE BRIDGE IS HERE YOU'VE GOT A LOOKOUT POTINS JUST HERE SO JUST CALL OUT TO THAT PERSON ON THE BRIDGE THE OFFICER SHIP BEARING RED FIVEO GREEN FIVEO WHEYOUR POSITION IS ANGLE OF SIT IF IT'S AN AIRCRAFT AND YOU'D IMMEDIATELY LOOK AT IT AND DECIDE WHAT ACTION TO TAKE BUT IF YOU'RE ON THAT LOOKOUT POSITION WHICH IWAS ON QUITE A LOT AS A SEAMAN IT'S ROUGH BECAUSE AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN ALL THE TIME A DESTROYER YOU'RE AMOST A SUBMARINE AT TIMES THE WHOLE OF THE SEA COMES UP OVER YOU AND YOU GET KNOCKED BACK AGAINST THA SERCH LIGHT ADIT IT'S VERY DAMP THAT IS VERY ROUGH UNCOMFORTABLE AND THIS IS WHAT O YOU GET USED TO YOU USED TO WEAR A SPECIAL SUIT WHICH COVERED YOU COMPLETELY WATERPROOT SUIT WITH CAPE UP LINING BUT EVEN EVEN THAT THE WATRALL THE WAY DOWN AND YOU GOT SOAKING WET I REMEMBER COMING OFF WATCH OCCASION LIKE THIS CAUSE NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO CLIMB BACK DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE LADDERS OF THE SHIP BECAUSE THE DOORS THAT YOU WOULD GO IN AND OUT IN PORT WERE OPEN WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA THOSE DOORS WOILL BE CLOSED BECAUSE THE WATER COMES IN THOSE SO YOU HAVE TO CLIMB DOWN LADDERS DOWN THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP NOT OUTSIDE IN THE SEA BUT CLIMB DOWN FROM THE TOP DECK TO THE LOWER DECK AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL THE WAVE IN IT HITS YOU YOU CAN GET WASHED AWAY OLD ON VERY TIGHT WEL THIS WAS THE MIDDLE WATCH I CAN RECALL WHICH S FROM TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNI FOR TWELVE O'CLOCK AT N TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BUT YOU'RE NOT ON WATCH LOOKOUT ALL THAT TIME OF THE FOUR HOUR WATCH YOU DO DIFFERENT JOBS HALF HOURLOOKOUT HALF HOUR PERHAPS ON THE RADAR SET OF O OE HALF HOUR BEHIND A GUN WHERE THERE'S AYOU BECOME PART OF THE GUN CREW SO IF YOU DID HAVE TO GO INTO ACTION DO THE SHOOTING WHILE THE REAL GUN CREW IS CALLED UP TO TAKE OVER FROM YOU WELL ON THIS OCCASION IT HAD BEEN VERY WET OUTSIDE I'D GOT SOAKE IN AND TIRED I SAY MIDDLE WATCH PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK I'D COME DOWN SO I WENT DOWN TO MY MESS DECK WHICH IS IN THE FOKAL ITW'S A ROUGH PART OF THE SHIP I HADN'T SLUNG MY HAMMOCK I'D SLEPT ON THE SONS AND THIS TIME I DIDN'T FANCYSLEEPING ON THE CUSHIONS BECAUSE THE SHIP WAS GOING SO MUCH THIS WAY AND I KNEW I'D COME OFF THE CUSHIONS SO I GOT DOWN UNDER THE MESS TABLE THERE WAS ABOUT THAT MUCH WATER ON THE FLOOR THE DECK NOT THE FLOOR ON THE DECK ABOUT THAT MUCH SO I GOT ALL MY CLOTHES ON AD ETHIS SUIT SUIT AS YOUCALLED IT AND EVERYTHING AND I'M LAYING DOWN TH OF TO SLEEP STRAIGHT AWAY THE NEXT THING I KNOW A FOOT HAD TOUCHED ME AND OPENED MY BLEARY EYES AND THERE WAS THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH EDING SEAMAN OF THE MESS AND HE WAS SAYING TO ME I'M TOLD THIS IN THE MORNING BY THE LEADING HAND OF THE MESS HE SAID THE OFFICER SAID O YOU COME ON SEAMAN YOU CAN'T SLEEP UNDER THERE IT'S TOO WET AND I SAID AND HE LOOKED AT THE LEADING HAND AND SAID WHAT DID HE SAY AND THE NMES IM A I DO'T KNOWI DON'T READ THAT LANGUAGE AND SO O WELL WE'D BETTER LET HIM SLEEP THERE AND HE LEFT YOU THERE NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT IT O YO EE E WELL YOU'RE LIING IN THAT MUCH WATERTHE DECKS OF THE SHIPS WERE INSIDE OU KN INSIDE YOUR MESS DECK THE WATER JUST IT'S ONE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE AND A LITTLE BIT WARMER INSDE SO YOU GET ALL HUMIDITY ATHEWATER RUNS DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE DECKS ANY TIME YOU'RE ON THE CAVALIER YOU HAVE A LOOK AND T INSIDE BECAUSE YOU'RE METAL WORK AT THE SHIPS SIDE IT'S ONLY ABOUT EIGHTH OF AN INCH NO THICKER THAN THAT AND SO THERE THEY ARE WERS YOU'V GOT WATER MOST OF THE TIME ENON YOUR MESS DECKS WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA IN HARBOUR YOU NOT TOO BAD IT GETS A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE THERE WAS ANOTHER TIME WHEN WE WORKED WITH QUEEN MARY AD WE HAD TO PICK HER UP TO BRING HER IN WE WENT OUT AND IT WAS ONE OF THE ROUGHEST STORMS E HAD ABOUT THREE REALLY ROUGH STORMS IN THE PERIOD THAT WE WERE LOOKING IN THE ATLANTIC AD WE HAD TO AT THIS TIME IT'D BE ABOUT MARCH NINETEEN FORTY FIVE OR WE HAD TO GO AND PICK UP QUEEN MARY THE STORM HAD BEEN RAGING ALL THE WAY FROM AMERICA IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF EBIG STORM THAT HAD COME ACROSS OUR WAY AND THE QUEEN MARYBROUGHT IT WITH U SORT OF THING AD WE PICKED HER UP AND I THINK WE WERE A DAY OR MORE WAITING TO PICK HER UP BECAUSE EVEN SHE HAD BEEN HELD UP BY THE BAD STORMS WELL WE AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAS THE SISTER SHIP AT THAT TIME BUT WE GOT REALLY BENT UP WE LOST A MOTORBOAT WE LOST ONE OF WHALERS M WE GOT REALLY KNOCKED ABOUT ADWHEN WE GOT TOWARDS THE CLYDE THE E QUEEN MARY KNOWING IT WAS IN THE AREA THERE WOULD BE U BOATS HAD TO RELY ON HER SPEED SO AS AS WE GOT WITHIN HAILING DISTANCE I SUPPOSE IF YOU SAY THE CLYDE THE QUEEN MARY DECIDED SHE COULDN'T SLOW DOWN TO KEEP UP WITH US CAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH FOR US WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER SO SHE JUST FLASHED TA MESSAGE SEE YOU IN THE CLYDE AD SHE KEPT UP HER SPEED AND GOT INTO THE GLYDE SHE HAD THE WHOLE OF THE FRONT OF HER BRIDGE STOVED IN AND IT WAS A BIG SHIP WELL UP IN THE AIR THEY HAD A LOT OF CASUALTIES BECAUSE THEY WERE CARRIEND ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND TROOPS AND THIS WAS NOW LATE AT NIGHT I THINK ABOUT UM T O' CLOCK OR TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT BUT ANYWAY SHE GOT INTO THE CLYDE WITHOUT ANYTHING BUTDAMAGE FRM FROM THE SEA WE LIMPED IN LATER ON NOW IN THE CLYDE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ANCHOR AND WE COULDN'T GO FURTHER IN TO GRENCK TO GREENOCK BECAUSE AFTER THAT YOU GO THROUGH THE BOOM AND THE BOOM IS CLOSED AT NIGHT UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARESARY TO OPEN THE BOOM WHICH PREVENTS OR ELSE TO PREVENT BOATS GETTING AT THAT POINT SO AT THE OTHER SIDE WHERE WE HAD TO TIE UP TO A BOY WE HAVE TWO BOY JUMPERS TO TI UP TO A BOY YOU HAVE TO STOP AND YOU HAVE TO LOWER YOUR WHALER WITH THE BOY JUMPER AND THE ROWERS IN IT TO TAKE YOU TO THE BOY WITH THE CHAIN TO CLIP IT TO THE BOY WELL IF I'VE GIVEN YOU A PICTURE OF HOW ROUGH THE STORM WAS IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT FIRST WHALER WE UM DOWN ONTO THE WATER MANAGED TO GET DOWN SAFELY BUT GOT WASHED AWAY WITH HE CREW IN IT FURTHER DOWN THE CLYDE THAT WAS A WAY FOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO LOWER ANOTHER WHALER ALL OF US WAS UP ON THE FOKSL OKW ALL THE SEAMAN THAT COULD HELP WAS UP ON THE FOKAL AND BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE YOUR ANCHOR YOU'E JUST USING OU ANCHOR CHAIN WHICH GOES WITH A WIRE ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE ANCHOR CHAIN THE WHALER HAS TO TAKE THIS WIRE TO THE BOY TO CLAMP IT ONTO THE BOY ANDTHEN THE BOY IS PULLED BY THE ANCHOR CHAIN NEARER THE SHIP SOTHE CLIP IT ON SO ANYWAY THEY LOWERED THE SECOND WHALER THE BOY JUPER MANAGED TO GET ON TO THE BOY AND IN DOIN SO BROKE HIS WRIST AND IN THE END I TK IT WAS ABOUT FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO CLIP UP TO THE BOY AND THE CAPTAIN HAID TOPS ALL ROUND I HATED A SMELL OF RUM ANNYWAY AND NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD MY TOT ECAUSE IT'S HORRIBLE BUT I HAD IT THAT NIGHT BECAUSE WE WERE FROZEN FROZEN STIFF AND E ANE TO GET AWAY WITH IT BUT NOTHING WAS EVER SAID ABOUT THIS TYPE OF THING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH PEOPLE AT THE PORKS KNEW THESE BIG SHIPS CMECOME IN IT WAS T A THING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THE GERMANS ALSO KNEW THEY WERE BRINGING ALL THESE LARGE NUMBERS BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS THIT COULD CARRY D ANY OF THE U BOAT CAPTAINS I UNDERSTAND AND THIS IS NORMAL KNOWLEDGE WERE OFFERED A LARGE SUM OF MONEY THOUSANDS OF WHAT THEYTATS TON O JOCE MARKS DOSE MARK THOUSAND DOLERS AND THE HIGHEST OF THE O HONOURS TO HAVE KNOCKED DOWN ANYONE OF THESE MONSTERS UTWE NEVER LOST ONE FORTUNATELY I'V IT TO SAY BUT THE QUEEN MARY WAS REALLY BATTERED VERY BADLY BATTERED HOW WE DIDN'T GET TURNED OVER I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHEN ER YU'RE TALKING ABOUT BIG SEAS WHAT SORT OF SIDE ARE YOU TOOK WELL IF Y THE SEAS ITSELF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ELL IT'S GENERALLY KNOWN THAT SOME OF THE WAVES WERE SIXTY FOOT HIGH YOU THINK OF SIXTY FGOING UP THAT WAY WHEN YOU GO UP TO THE WAVE AND YOU COME DOWN TO THE TROUGH YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOOT ADTHERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN CUT THROUGH THOSE WAVES THE BIG SHIPS OR THE SMALL SHIPS YOU ACTUALLY GO UP ON THAT WAVE AND THEN YOU FEEL IT AS YOU COME DOWN WITH A CRUNCH LIKE THAT AND THEN YOUUP TO THE NEXT ONE NDALL THE TIME YOU'RE CORK SCREWING YOU'RE NOT STILL AND USED TO THIS FTER ATHE FIRST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT ROSED ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE YOU GO THROUGH ANORMAL CORRIK FLATS THEY'RE CALLED ON A DESTROYER THE NORMAL CORRIDORE ON TE FLOOR ON A DESTROYER RIGIS ABOUT THAT WIDE WELL WHEN YOU FIRST GO ABOARD ONE LIKE THAT AND IT WAS FAIRLY CALM WHEN YOU SET OUT ORSCAPA FROM GREENLOCK BUT AS YOU WALK ALONG THE DECK COMES UP TO MEET YOU AS IT GOES UP AN YOU HIT YOUR FEET AS YOU GO DOWN ON THE DECK YOUKNOW IT THAT DECK HAS GONE AWAY AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN AND THIS HITS YOU FROM THE TOP AND THEN WEL THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE DOING THIS THIS BULK HI HITS OUAND ACTUALYOU KNO THAT BULK IT HITS YOU SO IN TIME YOU LEARNED TO WORK LIKE A SAILOR AND AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN YOU GO DOWN WITH IT AND COME UP WITH IT AND THAT'SYOU'LL FIND SAILORS AWHEN YOU GET ASHORE THEY WORK WITH A RLE WALK WITH A ROLL THAT IS JUST THAT WALKING ON THE SHIP SO AFTER THE END OF THE WAR RIGHT DAY RIGHT YOU'RE NOT FINISHED YE AND VIDAY ITSELF WE WERE AA'S THE NINTH OF MAY WE WERE BRINGING IN THE OLDER FRANKS AD WE GOT NOTICED THAT THE PEACE HAD BEEN DECLARED FOR THE NEXT DAY WE WERE GOMING ININTO GREENOCK SO WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN THE LAST OF THE ONE SHIP CONVOYS BEFORE THE WAR ENDED IN GREENOCK I BELIEVE TS EITHER WEDNESDAY OR SUNDAY HALF THE SHIPS COMPANY WAS ALLOWED LEAVE WHICH WASN'T ME I'M AFRAD I WASN'T ONE OF THE SHIPS COMPANY UT THEY WENT ASHORE TO T GREENOCK AND WE HAD A GOOD OW TIME SO THEN WE STILL CARRIED ON WITH SOME OF THESE CONVOYS AFTER THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS QUITE A FEW OF THE U BOATS THAT APPARENTLY MISSING O THEM ONE OR TWO WENT TO BRAZIL OR WHATEVER THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE TA IF THERE WAS A ROB U BOAT AROUND THEY COULD HAVE KNOCKED DOWN SOME OF THE MONSTERS E WERE STILL BRING HIM BACK IN BUT WE HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL BUT TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT ANYWAY WERE THEN DESTINED TO GO ACROSS TO THETRY TO END THE JAPANESE WAR SOTWO BY TWO OUR FLOTILLA WENT IN FOR REFITS WE WREENT IN FOR REFIT LATE IN MAY JUNE BECAUSE WE WERE GOING OUT THERE ANYWAY BUT FORTUNATELY WHIE I WAS ON LEAVE TO GO OUT THERE THE SHIP WAS DOWN AT DEVONPORT BEING REAFITTED THE WAR ENDED SI STILL GOT A TELEGRAM TO SAY DAY LEAVE EXTRA DAYS LEAVE EXLAR WHEN WE CAME BACK TO THE SHIP WE STILL HAD TO GOUT THERE BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING TO CLEAR UP AFTER THE WAR WELL THE WHOLE OF OUR FLOTILLA WE WERE OUT THERE THEN WE WERE THE LAST TWO O AS WE WENT OUT GIBRALTAR MALTAR ADAN AND PLACES LIKE THAT WE THOUGHT WE WAS IN FR A LOVELY SUMMACH CREISE UWHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE NO WHEN WE GOT TO TRINKHAMAL THAT WAS OUR NAVAL BASE WE BASED AT TRINHAML AND WEREALSO BASED AT SINGAPORE OR WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE THIS WAS JUST ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THE WAR AND WE WERE CARYING OUT AN EXERCISE WITH HMS SUSSEX AN ANOTHER SHIP AND THE CAPTAIN THE THE FLOTILLA LEADER WHO WAS ON HMS CEZAR AND OURSELVES IN CAVALIER WERE ORDERED TO GO WITH THE SUSSEX TO A PROBLEM SO WE IMMEDIATELY WENT AT FULL SPEED WE WERE SENT TO TO JARVA WE STOPPED ON A COUPLE OF TROOP SHIPS ON THE WAY REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT BUT WE TOOK ON BOARD FULL DECK WAS COVERED WITH INDIAN TROOPS ARMED INDIAN TROOPS AND THE CAVALIER WAS THE SAM AND THE CASAR WAS ALSO AND THE SUSSEX ANCHORED OUTSIDE SURRABAY BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GET IN WE COULD HARDLY GET IN BECAUSE THERE WAS A SUNKEN JAPANESE CRUISER IN THERE IN THA WAY SO CESAR WENT IN FIRST BECAUSE SHE WAS PILOTILA LEEDER TROOPS WE WERET IN SECONDS AS WE WERE SECOND AND THEN THE CAVALIER AFTERADS S WE WENT IN IT WAS DAYLIGHT WE HAD ALL THESE TROOPS ON BOARD IF WE HAD ANY TROUBLE WE COULDN'T HAVE USED OUR GUNS CAUSE LUCKILY WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE FROM THE SHORE S WE CAME INTO SUROBAYA IWAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE AND THERE WAS BODIES DOZENS OF THEM IN WHITE NAVAL UNIFORMS I THINK THEY WERE PROBABLY DUTCH I DON'T THINK THEY WAS OURS BUT MOVING AVOIDING THIS WRECKAGE AND AVOIDING THE BODIES AND YOU GOT TO THE STAGE NOW WEWER IN THE WAR BODIES IN THE WATER MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT THEY WERE BODIES ANDDEAD YO KNOWSO ANYWAY WE SLOWLY MOVED IN WE ANCHORED IN DOCK THERE AND ONE BY ONE THE CRUISER DISGORGED HER TROOPS FIRST AND WE CAME IN NEXT SO THE THREE OF US ALL OUR TROOPS WENT ASHORE D BEEN ALREADY TAKEN OVER BY TH UK ARMY I TH HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN AHEAD AN IT WAS THE INDAN INNESIAN REBELS THAT WERE FIGHTING THEY H'D ALREADY KILLED BRIGADEER MALLABY THAT WAS THE RMY BOS AND THESE TROOPS WENT ASHORE AND WE STAYED THERE READY FOR A LOT OF SURVIVORS OF THE DUTCH PEOPLE BE BROUGHT ACROSS FROMA CAMP RIGHT OT THE OTHER SIDE OF SUREBAYA AND THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT UNDER AN ESCORT E ANOTHER TROUOCE BRIGANDMALAVY HAD BEEN KILLED UNDER A TROUCE THIS SUPPOSED TO BEN ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DUTCH PEOPLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN MOSTLY IN A CAMP ON THE OTHER SIDE THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS BY ANOTHER TROOCE ARMY TRUCKS GURDED BY INDIAN TROOPS THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS TO US AND WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THEM ONBOARD AND WE WERE TO TAKE THEM OUT TO THE TROOPERS WHICH COULDN'T GET INTO THE HARBOUR WELL WE WERE THEN TOLD WHILE WEERE WITED FOR THESE PEOPLE TO COME ACROSS WE WERE TO GO T INTO THE WATER BECAUSE WE MIGHT BE USED WHIH WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AS IT HAPPENED WHEN THIS CONVOY OF ARMY TRUCKS GURDED BY INDIAN TROOPS GOT AS FAR AS SURUBAA THAT THEY WERE STOPPED ALTHOUGH THEY HAD A WHITE FLAG THEY WERE STOPPED BY THE POST OFFICE WHICH WAS FULL OF INDIAN DERNESIAN REBELS THE INDIAN REVELS SET UP TRENCH MARTERS AND MACHINE GUNS AND AS SOON AS THE CONVOY GOT THERE THEY SHOT THE TROOPS THAT WERE GURDING THE CONVOY AND THE CONVOY COME TO THE HALT SO WE WERE CALLED IN TO USE OUR FOUR H FOUR O FIVE GUNS SO WE HAD TO FIRE ON THE TOWN AND WE TOOK OUT THE POST OFFICE INGUNESIAN TROOPS IN IT AND TWHEN THE CONVOY COME THROUGH WE WENT BACK INTO HARBOUR ANDWE HAD ALL THE DUTCH PEOPLE ON BOARD AND WE TOK THEM OUT TO SE SOWE WE DIDN'T PERSONALY HAVE TO GO ASHORE E HAD TO GO ASHORE LATER ON TO GUARD SOME OF THE WAREHOUSES AND SO ON BT WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO ANY FIGHTING THE ONLY FIGHTING WE HAD TO DO WAS FIRRING E GON BECAUSE I WAS ON THE UPPER DECK AT THE TIME WHEN WE WERE CALLED IN TO FIRE AND I WAS CALLED OFF THE UPPER DECK FIRE WY GUN AND I SAID I'M NOT GOING THEY SAID YOU'RE TODAY STHEY PUT ME ON T ON THE GUN GUNNERY WAT ANOTHER ONE AND WE HAD TO FIRE TO DO DIRECTIONS OA SPOTTERPLANE THAT WAS SENT UP BY THE ARMY I'M SETAN SPOTTEPLANE AND APPARENTLY WE TOOK OUT THE POST OFFICE SOHAD GOOD DEAL OF DONTING TEDAY WE DID HAVE HEM IN BOARD OVERNIGHT A LOT OF T DUTCH PEOPLE WE VOCATED ALL THE FOREIGN MESS DECKS AND HAD TO SLEEP AFT ON THE UPPER DECK IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND THE DUTCH PEOPLE WOMEN IN THE FRONT THERE IL WE TOOK THEM OUT TOTHE OTHER SHIPS THAT AND THEN WE GOT OUR PLACE BACK I LOST A PAIR OF SAND O AS THEY DISAPPEARED HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU'RE SAILING INTO A HARBOUR TECK AND YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF NAVAL PEOPLE WELL YOU'RE APPREYOU'RE APPREHENSIVE TO START WITH BUTAT THE A R YOU'RE VERY SELDOM FRIGHTENED I SUPPOSE YOU WERE IN ADRELLE DRULE ACOMES BACK LATER ON AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF WELL I COULDHAVE BEEN KILLED THERE YOU KNOW BU I WASN'T AND THAT'S HOW YOU TOOK IT YOU COULDN'T AS YOU THOUGHT OF ALL THESE THINGS AT THE TIME YOU'D BE A NERVOUS WRECK UT YOU'RE EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AD I WERE NINETEEN YEARS OLD AND ANYTHING HAPPEND AND FORTUNATELY YOU ACCEPT IT IT'S NOT FEAR SOMETIMES IWLI THINKING BACK OW AND SAY WELL I COULD HAVE BEN KILLED THIR OU BUT I'M NOT I'M HE SO WE ACEPT IT AS JUST A FACTOR OF LIFE IT WAS EXCITING ET'S QUITE AUQUITE A BIG WAY TO END THE WAR HA TO END YOUR NAVAL SERVICE REALLY ISN'T IT TO BE INVOLVED IN YU KO CONTACT LIKE THAT S NICE TO BE AT THIS STAGE AND KNOW THAT YOU'VE DONE CERTAIN JOBS WHE INSTEAD OF WELL WE MUST HAVE KILLED PEOPLE BY T THE THE POST OFFICE BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM ANDAND YOU KNOW BY DOING THAT YOU HELPED TO SAVE HELPED TO SAE THE LOSS OF PERHAPS EVEN UNTIL THREE HUNDRED OF FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE IHAD THE SAME FEELING ABOUT WHEN WE WERE ESCORTING THE TROOPERS THE FACT THAT WE NEVER KNEW WHETHER WE HAD SUNK A SUBMARINE A U BOAT BECAUSE WE NEVER STAYED LONG ENOUGH ALL WE COULD DO WAS DEPTH CHARGE A TARGET IF THAT TARGET WAS A U BOAT WE MIGHT HAVE SUNK IT OR IT MIGHT HAVE GOT AWAY BUT OUR RL JOB WAS TO LOOK AFTER A SHIP COMING IN WITH FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS AND AS LONG AS WE SAVED THAT I'M HAPPY BUT YOU NEVER KNOW I JUST HOPED WE DIDN'T I JUST HOPED THAT THERE WASN'T A U BOAT THERE AND THAT THOSE PEOPLE WEREN'T KILLED THEY WERE ONLY DOING THE SORT OF THING THAT WE WERE DOING AND THAT WAS A JOB
