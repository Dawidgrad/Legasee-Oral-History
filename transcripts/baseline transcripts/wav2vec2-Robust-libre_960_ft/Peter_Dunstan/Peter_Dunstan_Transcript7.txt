okay so finally you're on land anyway am as a raw marine in singapore what what do you remember now at this point things were getting a little bit rough the army were fighting a retreat down malacia and the retreat was such that they got over the causeway there's a big big causeway that joins malaya to singapore and the argiles and southern highlanders were the last british troops across the causeway before it was blown blown they dynamited it within within twenty four hours the japs were crossing the the gap which was blown it was more or less just like a little swimming pool but it was decided that the raw marines would join the argyle and southern highlanders who had been cut up very badly in malaya and we were ordered to join the argiles and we fought in the final stages of singapore island with the argiles it became known which is one of the honors in the romaine day of the plymouth argos all the romarines came from plymouth the argiles and southend the hands so they couldn't rename them anything else and there was about equal number of the bra marines and the argos so we were called to plymouth argos and it's down in history the a a battalion of the plymouth argos fighting in singapore and you i mean you used fire huge guns on on a ship and probably you trained with some machine guns but what was it like when you started actually fighting all i can remember about that it was pouring down a body rain we were moved up with the argiles up into the a more or less jungle i know a rubber plantation sorry not jungle rubber plantation in the northeast corner of singapore island and i can sort of roughly recall standing under a palm tree pouring down with body rain and the next thing we knew was being shot at by the japs retreating back and retreating back and getting back finally into the argiles barracks in singapore a and a told we had to surrender that was about it what was that like can you remember i can't really i can't really remember just the fact that what i sit with prisoners of war and what was it like when you came face to face with the japanese and and they started moving you about we didn't funny enough the japs ordered all prisoners of war or before that and when we got back to tase park which was the argos headquarters and in the fighting i got a a motor bomb splinter in my left hand the factors scars still there and i was sent down to singapore general hospital because in the tropics if you ever go in the tropics and you cut yourself that 'll term poison within within hours and of course with that on my knuckle it blew up and i was sent down to singapore general hospital and a ah that was more or less where i was well taken prisoner the japanese i didn't see many japanese any japanese at all they came in and ordered everybody out of singapore a general hospital because they wanted it for their own troops and i was moved with a number of other and allied servicemen who were also there to a small school which was a first aid post and from there up into a change village which is where the japanese they cordoned off the whole of the north northeast corner i think it is of singapore island is standing now occupied by the by the singapore an airport and we we were moved up there and i joined the argiles and the marines that were there and that part of it the regimental doctor of course wanted some help and my pal who she corporal on the repulse and myself had a an argyle volunteered to act as orderlies for the doctor and so we had a special little place in one of the shops in singapore in change change village which was the medical room and we had we lived in the nice quarters in the back of three of us so we we were separated a little bit but we did all right when did you when did you move out a singer for when when you heard it out am i can't give you exact dates but the a nineteen thirty six fact his subject i'm doing upstairs at the moment and there was a scheme to connect the tire railway to the burmese railway and the japanese had got and got the plans for this in fact i've found two of the plans that are in existence in the role geographical society in london i've been up there and traced them and in nineteen thirty six a
