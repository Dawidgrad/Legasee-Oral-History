after operation can some of the modest convoys then he started doing a bit for atlantic stuff yes we don a few atlantic convoys but of course you see they they were always worried about a couple of german bob ban pocket battleships over at luton in the atlantic so we done a bit of time in the atlantic and course prior to that we escorted the ark royal up when they when they were chasing the bismark we were involved in that as well as ameba sir so we you know we'd heard that the the hood had been sunk you know i gave us all a bit of a shock really because he should we thought the hood was the most powerful ship in in the in the navy which it was you know they they had they owed the two assets six guns they had eight fifteen inch guns you know and it just disappeared on his feet so we didn't know then but only three survivors and we were down in gibraltar the ark royal and the sheffield and us so we headed up there to try to cut the the bismark of because it was heading to a nobody they'd lost it for a couple of days really and i headed off for going stopping getting into breast and in in in northern france and eventually then i think it recited by catalina aircraft or something like that and then and then the ark roused aircraft we saw them taken off and that was a mighty thing you know the ship was was going up and down thirty foot in the air and these swordfish were able to take off you know there was a mighty bit flying there you know and course the chef de sheffield the admiral sent the the sheffield to shadow the the bismark but he didn't tell the ark royal so the ark aircraft the first wave of them arrived and they they saw the ship and they thought it was the bismark and they dive down to bomb it and had to torpedo it and they fired all the torpedoes at the sheffield but luckily the they are the torpedoes they were all the the magnetic fuses on them they weren't working very well and they all passed underneath the sheffield and so she had a lucky escape she nearly got sunk with with with with with with her own aircraft so then they all came back and then they they re loaded the torpedoes and they put their sort of a contact pistols on you know whether the torpedo would have to hit the ship the ship to explode so they took off again the next time they you know in the sheffield they knew he was there then they'd sheffield directed them on to the air on to the bismark and and they they hit the bismark round the rudder area of the ship and and disabled her really she was going round in circles and and the admiral renan was was dying to get in and have a crack at the end we were told to lay off until the the biggest o k g five in the rodney came up because i think the admiralty were afraid after the hood being sunk you know would want shot we could have been sunk a one shot as well you know and they wouldn't have been best pleased so we we had to do anyway we were looking after the ark royal and cause the prince egon was around there as well a cruiser so if we didn't look after the ark royal she she could have been sunk you know and and partly in the middle of it all the there was a after during the bismark action there was a german u boat returning to base and he was in the area and he had the renown and at rallies sights but he'd run out a torpedo he could have sunk the two of us if he had torpedoes but didn't have he didn't have any left he'd just come back from patrol so we were very lucky in that respect and a silicon no we didn't see her no no but we we were close by you know if they they they were lucky really because they nearly run out of fuel you know and be lucky that they were able to catch up with her really otherwise we could have been the only if it came to the last ditch is pose and we were the only ship there we we would have had to go in and and attack her you know might have had a better chance because she wouldn't she wasn't so she wasn't steering very well she's going round in circles but in she was eventually sunk you know and i can recall a funny story after that cause a friend of mine was on a destroyer he was on the mary and and they picked up some of these german survivors from the bismark and anchors all all the ships had to had to head for you a couple of them were sunk on the way back actually and because they were all run and running short of fuel and and this ship he was on the they put in i think was a milford haven in in in in the dead of night you know her first thing in the morning to land these german prisoners and in there and he said they he said we blindfolded all the german prisoners before the tebefore they went ashore he said he said we didn't even know where we were ourselves east we went in tied alongside a jetty and nobody had a clue where they were he said we blindfolded all the germans against they'd see anything he said we didn't know where we were anyway only the captain knew where they were
