a well let's let's move the story on so but i'll talk about the convoys now because you see that was in the sense it wasn't as bad as being in a convoy under constant attack because we were torpedoed and then that was it we were in the boats we had problems in the boats and so and we had all those difficulties but in the on a couple of occasions we were under attack for four days in almost a semi storm you know by yew boats and ships were being blown up all round us and you know you didn't get any sleep hardly because it was for round far off than you had to relieve people for their meals as well so you hardly got any time to have a rest and people's nerves came on edge you know and then if a doll jammed you thought you'd been torpedoed and people jumping up and a the most dramatic moment i think was when the last ship in the convoy line which used a designated rescue ship for pick up survivors from those ahead had been now in the boats and we were then the ship one of our ships of our line was the empire shackleton the name is a siamy book and was torpedoed and so we we we stopped to help it were you there were you the rescue it yes we were the last ship in line at that time and we stopped to rescue this ship and there were submarines all around and we thought any moment we're going to be hit too because the ages were stopped even we stopped to see and they were telling them to hurry up to come across so one life boat got off the ship and came across and we picked up the people down and then am we saw people running around on the ship with torches looking over the bow and am i had really been hit in the bow but evidently the bulkhead held so they weren't sinking so they they sent us a message signal a message that they were going to try and make for the asus so then we got these people and we were in full steam to court with the convoy now that particular ship was torpedoed again that night and this time it sank and it was picked up by now that wasn't a mite it was picked up by the empires shackling the other ships have got the name is my book and it was an all mentioned cruiser and that in turn was torpedoed and i had three hundred people on board then and most they were lost and pretty well all the people we could have saved went down on that ship the second time and so we only had twelve from it what was this atlantic atlantic compares that was the when the very dangerous area of the spain of malt of gibraltar coming up to north here just conaway when you've gone back to liverpool and after sir alone how is it determined what your next ship is harris by how is it determined what your next ship will be i mean who who makes that do you we didn't decide what your next trip would be or your next ship would be you were allocated this ship and the ministry of transport deciding when it was going to go and so i mean we were going back in vol to america picking up alms and tanks at one time and then apples and things like that and fruits and all kinds of food stuffs you know as well as alms and jeeps in boxes and things like that you know and and then we went to italy to naples to supply the army there and when we got into the port it was absolute devastation of a ship sunk all over the place and anyway we unloaded these thirty ton sherman tanks and they brought down portable cranes to lift them other it's quite a hairy business you now and then that the harbor is in a bad state because of the mold with damage and so on you couldn't we had males a rough sea coming in the that was a bit hairy am so those were some of the incidents but the convoys were the the worst things really for tension and so on i mean to see ships being blown up alongside you and people going on find people struggling to get off the ship into the boats when it was a half gale running when the ship down light that june and i know one ship next as a passenger ship was hit and we could see the women and children on board the ship as well nothing we could do we were crestor ship in our line we went to go over there you know oh just talk a bit about the configuration of the convoys and how in harris determined where you were in a convoy well if this was all andicasion before you left because they'd have a meeting between the commodore who was the vice aveo vice admiral retired normally and the captains of all the mason ships and also the escorts and they would decide then the convoy positions and places and also the escort duties now the problem was as i mentioned already the corvettes which we must produced were very useful for death charging when the submarine was underneath but when the submarine was on the surface in the early days certainly the submarines could do eighteen knots and the corvettes could do sixteen they could out round them and so they could deal with them down below not on the surface now destroyers were much better but then the destroyers were in short supply also the destroyers had only a limited range and so they couldn't go that far without refueling sometimes we refuel them ourselves from the ship we took our own oil and you know they come alongside to put a pipe on but the destroyers were much more useful but we the shortage they had a land these covets and they went in the convoy they were on the perifery and so often the u bots be in the convoy and the escorts are over there and we get frustrated why don't they do something you know but understandably they were trying to track with the aztec and i underneath and trying to stop them coming in ahead but they weren't very effective what happened really was we needed air cover and then to solve that problem we we had were fitted with a hawk a hurricane on the ship on the fore deck blasted off by rockets because the fucker wolf condos jams used to flying round the convoy spotting for the submarines and you couldn't get at them and a no having a walrus or some bit like that because that couldn't hit them so by puts hurricanes on but the port pilot had no way to land he had a ditch and the san hope we be picked up then as the war moved on they developed a merchant ships into many aircraft carriers and the grain ships they carried about twelve planes and then they then later on they had more escort carriers and once we had air cover to a large tent the soberly menace dropped they were able to spot them coming in and then so and attack them you know but it wasn't there in the beginnings and there was a very dangerous sort of zone you know in mid atlantic to
