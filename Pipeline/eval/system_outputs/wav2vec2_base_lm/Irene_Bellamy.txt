MY NAME IS IRENE BELLAMY I READ JUST THEN WHERE ARE YOU FROM I WAS FROM BRISTOL FROM THE FISH PONDS AREA WHERE I WAS BORN AND I WENT TO SCHOOL IN BRISTOL AND STARTED MY WORK AFTER SCHOOL IN BRISTOL HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN WARBURG OH WELL I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN NINETEEN HAVE TWENTY WAS I LIKE YOU BRISTOL WERE YOU TELL ME BIT OF MY SCHOOLING AND IS MY BEST TO UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE HERE AND I ORIGINALLY WENT TO A SMALL PRIVATE SCHOOL AND AND THEN WENT TO COLSTON FROM THERE AND THEN IT BRISTOL ITSELF I FAN RATHER DULL YOU KNOW IT WAS ALL PUBS ON CHURCHES THAT'S HOW IT SEEMED TO ME YOU KNOW THEY WEREN'T TO THE FUN THINGS THAT THERE ARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO DAY AND WE SPENT MOST OF OUR TIME EITHER GING TO THE OUR FREE TIME GOING TO THE SINUS AND OR PLAYING SOME KIND OF GAMES YOU KNOW I BELONG TO IN VARIOUS HOCKEY TEAMS AND TENNIS CLUBS AND AND AND DURING DURING THE WAR AND OF COURSE WE WORKED VERY LONG HOURS AND AT THE EIGHT SO THAT YOU WENT LOOKING FOR YOU MUCH LEISURE AND AND I MOVED BECAUSE OF THE BRISTOL BLITZ DURING THAT TIME AND I WAS PUT BY THE FIRM THEY DIDN'T WANT US IN THE DANGER OF CENTER OF BRISTOL AND SO ON AND SO THEY TOOK OVER A COTTAGE IN SHIFTING SODBURY AND I LIVED IN SHIPPING SODBURY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THAT WAS QUITE GOOD FUN OUT THE SORT OF VILLAINS LIFE LOTS GOING ON BUT I HAD ALWAYS HAD A YEN TO GO INTO THE NAVY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT AT MAINLY CAUSE I HAD FRIENDS WHO HAD JOINED THE SERVICES AND WAS IT WAS IT RAINS OVER ANY OTHER SERVICE I DIDN'T WANT TO JOIN YOU MEAN ENOUGH FOR WAS YES OR NO NO NO THAT MY PARTICULAR FRIEND WENT INTO THE WIRE AND SHE HAD A VERY INTERESTING TIME AS OUT IN WASHINGTON A WORKING FOR THE MET NOT MABEL THE AIR FORCE THE RED WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE YES YES LIKE THE UNIFORM TO IT JUST SADLY BUT NOT YET IN WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE IN EARNEST WORK ITSELF AND WELL AM AS SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF DESIGNER IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS A QUESTION OF DOING A TYPING HE WOULD DICTATE HIS DESIGN A REPORTS BECAUSE IT HAD ALL HAD TO GO UP TO THE AIR MINISTRY FOR APPROVAL BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A AN ORDER FOR THESE PLANS OF COURSE AND IT WAS TYPING ALL THESE SHEETS OF DESCRIPTION OF THESE PLANS AND AND THAT I MEAN TO SAY HE WAS A VERY UNDISCIPLINED MAN IN THAT HE LEFT EVERYTHING TO THE LAST MINUTE SO ONE WAS WORKING QUIET LATE AT NIGHT VERY OFTEN TO GET IT DONE TO THE JED LINE THAT THE MINISTRY HAD SET A BASIL HENDERSON AND HE DESIGNED A SMALL PLAYING CALLED THE AND WHAT DO THEY CALL IT AN THE HENDY IT WAS A BREAKDOWN OF HIS NAME BUT IT WAS BASIL HEN AND IT'LL COME TO ME BUT IT WAS A ROUND ABOUT THE TIME THAT THERE WAS A ANOTHER CHAP DESIGNING THOSE SMALL PLAINS AND I CAN'T THINK FOR HIS NAME NOW BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THE WAR WAS COMING IN NOT REALLY NOW I MEAN TO SAY THAT THE BOYS THAT WE USED TO MEET AND MIX WITH BUT WERE MOSTLY AN AIR FORCE TYPES OR GOING INTERESTED IN THE AIR FORCE AND WE KNEW THE LITTLE FIVE OR ONE SQUADRON THE AT FILTON AND THAT MOST OF THEM FLEW WITH AND WE KNEW AT TIMES THAT FROM THEIR CONVERSATION THAT THINGS WERE GETTING VERY NEAR BUT AM NOT REALLY YOU KNOW NOT YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T PUTTING OUT THE BARRICADES OR ANYTHING WOULD NOT THE OUTRAGE OF WARD YOU REMEMBER I DO AND WE WERE OUT ON FILTON AERODROME WITH ME THEN THAT SUNDAY WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED IT WATCHING THESE LADS IN THEIR PLANS TAKING OFF PURELY FOR EXERCISE CERTAINLY DID CHANGE IN BRISTOL WHEN WAR BROGAN WHAT WAS THE CHANGE YOU REMEMBER I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY CAUSE MOST OF MY LIFE WERE SPENT BETWEEN FISH PONDS AND ANTS YOU KNOW I VERY RARELY WENT THE OTHER WAY TOWARDS TOWN AND DIDN'T REALLY GET ANY FEELING OF WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE AND EVEN YOU KNOW I READ NOW ABOUT SOME OF THE GHASTLY THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBING YOU KNOW THE LOSS OF LIFE BUT IT DIDN'T BUT AFFECT ME DIRECTLY AND MY PARENTS HAD A SHOP IN FISH PONDS AND THEY STILL KEPT GOING ALONE QUIET SORT OF WAY DID YOU SEE IT YOU SEE IN READ YES I WAS IN THE AGE HERE AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FIRM MOVED US TO LIVE IN ATE SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BUSINESS OF TRAVELLING BUT WE DID HAVE A DAYLIGHT RAIDING IN YATES AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC AND THEY WERE THEY THEY SENT A SINGLE PLAN AND THEY SAY WE WERE ALL WORKING AWAY QUITE HAPPILY IN THE AIR RAID SIREN WENT AND THE I WAS BEING TAUGHT HOW TO PLAY BRIDGE BY THE FRIEND WHO WENT INTO THE AIR FORCE AND THEN WE DIDN'T TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE RETIRE THAT WE NEVER HAD ANYTHING AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS THE MOST ALMIGHTY EXPLOSION AND THE WHOLE BUILDING SHOOK AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED A SINGLE PLANE HAD COME IN APPARENTLY IT CAME IN FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTHERN FRANCE ARIA WHERE THE GERMANS HAD AN AIRPORT AND HAD FLOWN UP THE BRISTOL CHANNEL TO SOMEWHERE NORTH OF GLOUCESTER PICKED UP THE RAILWAY LINE AND ATE RUNS ALONG THE RAILWAY LINE IF YOU KNOW THE BUILDING AND FLEW DOWN AND DROPPED THIS STRIP OF BOMBS ALONG THE FACTORY FORTUNELY A COUPLE OF THEM DIDN'T GO OFF AND I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SEEING A DEAD BODY BECAUSE I KNEW MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FACTORY BECAUSE OF WHO I WAS WORKING FOR AND ONE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOUSE IN THE INTRIPING SORRY WAS A WOMAN CALLED SISTER HOBBS WHO BECAME QUITE WELL KNOWN FOR THE WORK SHE DID IN THAT BLITZ AND SHE JUST CAUGHT HOLD MEN SHE HAD COME ON WE'VE GOT TO GO OUT TO THE BRICK FACTORY SHE SAID TO IDENTIFY THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED AND YOU KNOW I WAS TAKEN WHAT OUGHT I IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE THOUGHT I TWENTY TWO AT TWENTY TWO TO SEE ALL THESE DISINTEGRATED BODIES I HADN'T SEEN THE DEAD BODY BEFORE AND THAT WAS VERY TRAUMATIC WAS THAT YOU THINK CATALIST THINKING I WANTED JOIN ME COME IN NO I DON'T THINK SO THAT WAS QUIETLY SIMMERING AWAY AND I THINK THE CATALIST IN THE END WAS WHEN MY BOSS MOVED HE WENT TO A FORM WHICH GAME YOU MAY KNOW OF BOOZY AND HAWKS THEY AND HE WASN'T A MUSICIAN OR HE HADN'T MADE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS AS THAT WAS THE JOB THEY DID ORIGINALLY THEY WERE MAKING SPARE PARTS FOR SOME OF OUR GUN TURRETS AND THEY AND FOUND THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD DESIGN WHAT THEY WANTED AND AND THEY GOT HIM AND THEY HAD HUNTED HIM AND WHEN HE LEFT I WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH A PERSON WHO GOT THE JOB AND I THOUGHT I WANT TO MOVE BUT I HAD TO WORK QUITE HARD TO GET INTO THE RENTS BECAUSE OF COURSE I WAS IN RESERVED OCCUPATION IS TO ASK WAS THERE IS A SEED IT WAS A RESERVED OCCUPATION SEE YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCEDURE TO GET OUT HERE AND THEY WENT THE RENT WENT OPEN FOR RECRUITMENT ANYHOW AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE BEING A A DRAWN I SUPPOSE IS A WORD FOR THE BY WAR ARTIST A MAN CALLED LEOPOLD FREEDOM SO I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RUN TO EARTH SINCE I'VE TRIED BECAUSE HE DID LIKE A MURAL OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THE FACTORY AND IT WENT TO THE M NATHALIE WHAT A ONE INTEFAGUS IT NATAL ARGAN IN FARGO SQUARE AND AND I WAS SITTING YOU KNOW WHILE HE WAS DRAWING ME AND TALKING TO HIM AND I SAID I WANTED TO JOIN THE RENT THEM THE PROBLEM WAS THERE WERE NO VACANCIES THAN I WAS IN THE RESERVED ACUTE SO HE GAVE ME THE NAME OF A WOMAN AGAIN I FORGOTTEN HER NAME BUT SHE WAS THE HEAD OF THE MINISTRY OF LABOR IN LONDON SO I GO OFF TO LONDON TO SEE THIS WOMAN AND SHE HOPED SHE TOLD ME THESE SORT OF INSIDE SECRET THAT I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN FAIRLY SOON BECAUSE THE WRENS WERE EXPANDING AND THEY EXPANDED VERY RAPIDLY AND I GOT IN VERY EASILY THEN BUT I HAD TO WAIT TILL THE DOORS OPEN CAUSE THE LORDS OF THE ADMIRALTY DIDN'T WANT WOMEN YOU KNOW THEY RELUCTANTLY TOOK THEM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR BUT YOU KNOW IT IT WAS A MAN'S SERVICE IT WASN'T FOR WOMEN WIN SO WHAT WAS THE PROCESS THEN FROM TRANSITION FROM BEING A SECRETARY IN A TO BECOMING A RAIL TO RUIN YET I REMEMBER IN HAVING MY PAY PERSON BEING SENT TO LEEDS BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY SUDDENLY EXPANDED THEY HAD TO OPEN NEW TRAINING DEFERS I WAS IN MY EARLY TWENTIES AND A I HAD WHAT THEY CALL A WHITE PAPER AND WHICH WAS A RECOMMENDATION FOR A COMMISSION AS SOON AS YOU WERE INTERVIEW ORIGINAL YOU KNOW MOST GIRLS HAVE TO WAIT AND WORK A WHILE BUT I WAS OLDER AND I THINK THEY SAW ME AS A POSSIBLE HAD BEEN OFFICER OR THEY DID ACTUALLY BUT THEN I WENT FROM LEEDS AFTER I DID MY BASIC TRADING TO ROCHESTER WHICH IS REALLY THE CHATHAM NOW I HAD SEEN MYSELF HIS BOAT'S CREW YOU KNOW IN AND BECAUSE I WAS A BRISTOLIAN I WANTED TO GO TO PLYMOUTH WHICH WAS BUT THE NAVY HAD OTHER IDEAS SO THEY SENT ME TO WAIT TO GO TO TRAINING FOR AN ADMIN OFFICER AT CHATHAM REALLY AND ANYHOW THEY PUT ME IN WHAT CALLED THE REGULATING OFFICE WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHERE YOU MONITOR PEOPLE COMING IN AND GOING OUT ON TELEPHONES AND I ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THE FIRST OFFICER WHO WAS THE ONE IN CHARGE WAS A VERY VERY DURABLE WOMAN AND AND SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY CALLED LADY BURTON SHAW WHO LIVED IN HOVE AND EVERY SATURDAY AFTERNOON LADY BURTONSHAW WOULD RING UP HER DAUGHTER JUST FOR A CHAT AND I WAS PUT ON THE TELEPHONE WHEN I LEAVE IT NEVER WORKED YOU KNOW THOSE PLUGGED AND TELEPHONES I NEVER WORKED ONE OF THOSE AND OF COURSE LADY BURTONSHAW COMES THROUGH AND I WAS A PANIC YOU KNOW I WASN'T VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT IT OF COURSE WHAT I DO IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THEIR CONVERSATION I PULLED THE PLUG OUT YOU SEE SO I HAD TO GO IN SHE CALLED ME IN AND SHE DON'T ON THE TELEPHONE SO IT WAS ME MA'AM SO YES YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A BROKEN REED AND I THOUGHT NOBODY HAS EVER CALLED ME A BROKEN RICE FIT FOR HA HA HA BUT YOU NOTED ME IN THE WORLD OF GOOD I THOUGHT I WAS GOD'S GIFT TO THE NEIGHBOR YOU SEE AND I WASN'T A HA HA HA HA BUT THAT THAT REMARKED REALLY HAS STUCK WITH ME ALL MY LIFE SO WE SEE RANDY WERE YOU EXACERATING YES AND YOU DON'T WRITE BUT I SUPPOSE I WAS NOR COMMAND IT WAS DO YOU USE AT WELL NOT ONLY IN SORT OF PHYSICS THAT WE WERE BILLETED IN ROCHESTER AND BECAUSE I WAS DOING THE ADMIN WORK IN THE OFFICE AT THE OFFICE WAS ATTACHED TO THE BILLET HOW DID YOU FIND MEANING RANDONE BEEN NICORETTE BOY AND I HAD NOT VERY FAR NO THAT WAS ANOTHER THING YOU DIDN'T TRAVEL FAR YOU KNOW A HOLIDAYS WERE WAS THE FURTHEST WE WENT WITH TENBY IN ITS HOUSE WALLS BUT I HAD BEEN TO LONDON AND I HAD BEEN TO FRANCE ON THE SCHOOL TRIP AND ONCE BUT NO NOT VERY FAR WE WENT VERY WELL ALL OF ANYHOW AS A FAMILY YOU KNOW WE HAD TO CUT OUR CORNERS SO AFTER ROCHESTER THEN WHERE DID YOU WHERE DID YOU GO THEN AND WELL WHEN I WAS AT ROCHESTER AND THE FIRST APHASIA WAS TELLING YOU CALLED ME A BROKEN READ AND I WAS IN THE AND WHAT DO THEY CALL IT NOW OH SORT OF THE OFFICE WHICH ALLOCATED POSTINGS TO THE GOAT THAT ALL THE GIRLS THERE WERE WAITING TO BE SENT SOMEWHERE AND AND I WAS THERE AND THAT NOTHING CAME IN BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAME IN FROM THE ADMIRALTY AND NOTHING CAME IN I WAS INTERESTED IN I WAS DOWN FOR HAD BEEN AND THEN I FOUND THAT TO DO ADMIN I HAD TO GO TO AND LOWEST OFF TO THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE WHERE THEY TRAINED ADMIN OFFICERS AND I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A LONG WAITING LIST AND I THOUGHT I DIDN'T JOIN THE NAVY TO SIT IN AN OFFICE AND WAIT FOR THAT SO I'D I WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNE TO GO AND I SAID NO SO THIS SO WHEN YOU REALIZE YOU'LL GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST I THE WELL I DIDN'T JOINED HER TO HAVE A COMMISSION ANYHOW YOU KNOW I JOIN YOU TO DO A JOB SO SHE SAID TO ME IF YOU SEE ANYTHING COMING THROUGH IT WAS A TELLY PRINTER IN THOSE DAYS AND LET ME KNOW AND I'LL SEE I SEE AT ALL I KNOW IS I DON'T WANT TO WORK IN LONDON I DON'T MIND WHERE ELSE I GO AND YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO STICK WITH MY SHORT HAND AND A A SORT OF GENERAL OFFICE FOR A CASE HE SAID SO IT COMES IT WAS AT THE TIME WHEN GENERAL IS ON HOW WAS AN GETTING TO BE QUITE WELL KNOWN AS THE COMMANDER AND HE SET UP IF YOU REMEMBER CHEF AND I LOOKED IT MIGHT SOMETHING CAME IN WITH A AND SET STROKE CHEF AND I THOUGHT THAT'S INTERESTING AND AT THE ANGER WAS THE ALLIED LEVEL COMMANDER EXPEDITIONARY FORCE AND THAT WAS ADMIRAMSEY AND I THOUGHT THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING YOU KNOW SIR I DON'T RELISH COULD I HAVE MY NAME PUT UP TO THAT VACANCY AND SO SHE AGREED AND YOU KNOW YOU HAD TO TAKE THE CHANCE WHAT OTHER APPLICATIONS THEY HAD AND THEN I GOT IT AND I SAID WHERE IS IT SO SHE SO WELL TO START WITH YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO NORTHWOOD SQUARE IN LONDON WHICH IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF SHAPE AND THE AND THE EXCEPT GROUP WERE COLLECTING THERE AND AND THEY WERE MOSTLY FRIENDS WHO WERE GOING TO DO THE DE DAY PLANNING BUT I GOT BECAUSE I PUT IN FREE AND SHAKES STROKE SHAPE I GOT ATTACHED TO THE AND THIS IS WHERE ALL PARRY CAME IN TO ADMIRAL PARRY WHO CHEFICLY BRITISH WE HAD STARTED D DAY BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS ALREADY POST OPERATIVE PLANNING AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS THOUGHT WHEN WE HAVEN'T WON THE WAR WHILE THEY'RE PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE USE AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS CAUGHT UP IN WET FROM THEN ON I WAS ATTACHED TO HIM AND SENT TO BUSHY PARK IN HEARTMATE HARTMAN SHORE ON ITS NEAR HAMPTON COURT PARIS AND IT WAS GENERALIZED POWERS AT HEADQUARTERS FOR THEY WERE COLLECTING ALL THE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE PEOPLE THERE YOU KNOW WELL THE TROOPS WERE BEING COLLECTED AROUND KENSONSUSSEX AND PLAYS A TORY IT'S MY NERVES YOU RE THE AND AND I SAW I DON'T WANT TO GO TO LONDON BUT ANYHOW IN THE END THEY SAID WELL YOU 'LL ONLY BE HOLD HELD THERE UNTIL AND AND I WAS ONLY HELD THERE A DAY I REMEMBER SITTING ON THE WALL OUTSIDE NORFOLK HAS WHICH IS WHERE THE LONDON GROUP WHERE AND TOLD TO WAIT AND SOMEBODY WOULD PICK ME UP TO SOME TEN ON IT BECAME HIGHLY SECRETIVE I WAS SITTING LIKE A LONELY RED WAS MY NAVAL CASE AND NOTHING AND THE JEEP CAME ZOOMING ROUND THE SQUARE AND AN AMERICAN STOP BY ME ANY SAID YOU RE AND I RAN BALMY GO AND A BUSHY PARK WELL I TELL I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM GOING I'VE JUST BEEN TOLD TO SIT ON THIS WALL SO HE SAID HE GOT ME ABOARD HIS JEEP AND WE WENT THROUGH THAT IT WASN'T FAR FROM NORFOLK TO GET OUT OF LONDON WENT TO BUSHY PARK AND OF COURSE WHEN I GET TO BUSHY PARK I'M THE ONLY REN THERE BECAUSE IT WAS THE SEPARATE UNITS OF THE BIG GROUP THAT WERE AT LOW FOLK AS YOU AH BE FORTY FOUR IN FORTUNE FOR FORTUNE FELLOW HERE WE JUST DESCRIBE LETTER BUSHY PARK OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING THERE BEFORE DID A WELL BUSHY PARK AND IT IS I PRESUME IT'S A SORT OF LOCAL IS A VERY LARGE PARK AND IN IT WERE PORTER CABINS IN WHICH AN BY THEN YOU GOT THE BRITISH AND THE FRENCH AND THE MERICANS THERE WERE THE FOUR WORDS NOT AS LES YET WELL THERE WERE A FEW BUT NOT MANY BUT I WAS THINKING OF THE THE GROUP THAT THEY SPLIT GERMANY UP IN REGIONS DIDN'T THEY THAT IS THE BRITISH RUSSIAN RUSSIAN BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER RUSSIANS BEING AT BUSHY PARK I THINK THEY LINKED UP LATER BUT I REMEMBER BEING IN IN ONE OF THESE WE HAD OUR OFFICE AND THIS IS WHERE I DID NOT HE COULDN'T SAY I MET HIM BUT THE LUDLBUGS HAD STARTED FLYING AND THEN WE THEY GOT THEY HAD BUSHY PARK IN THEIR SIGHTS AND THEY GOT VERY NEAR US SO THEY WERE AIRED SHELTERS BUILT SPECIALLY AND THE LOT OF THE AMERICANS PARTICULARLY THE WOMEN IN THE AMERICAN ARMY HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE THEY JUST WENT TO PIECES IF THERE WAS A AND THE RATE THEY THEY WERE TERRIBLY NERVOUS LOT AND BUT I QUITE ENJOYED BEING WITH THE CASE IT WAS A DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE ALTOGETHER BETTER EATING AND THE THE EQUIPMENT THEY GAVE US YOU KNOW IN THE HYGIENE THAT WAS PUT IN AND SO I WAS I WAS UNDER AIR AND IT S SUPERVISION AND SOMEBODY CALLED LADY BREKNOC I THINK SHE BECAME QUITE A POWER IN THE LAND AFTERWARDS FROM HER POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW BUT SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF US AND SHE AND I RESENTED HER BECAUSE SHE SHE USED TO OPEN MY POST WHICH CAUSED THE NAVY NEVER OPENED YOUR POST BUT THAT COURSE BECAUSE I WONDER UNDER ITS RULE ALL OUR POST WAS OPENED AND AND LADY BRETLOCK ALWAYS MADE A POINT OF READING AND REMEMBERING WHAT WAS IN AND I WAS ALWAYS SENDING HOME FOR MONEY AND SHE WAS ALWAYS SAYING YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED MONEY YOU'VE GOT PLENTY EVEN THOUGH YOU SHOULD MANAGE ON WHAT YOU'VE GOT AND THAT WAS SEVEN OR SIX WEEKS THOUGH FRONT FROM THERE AND DID YOU MEAN I KNOW WELL YES NO I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE LUDLEBUGS AND AND IF HE WAS ON SIGHT AND IN HIS OFFICE HE DIDN'T COME VERY OFTEN BECAUSE OF COURSE LY AND HIS RESPONSIBILITY WAS ENORMOUS AND THE PLACES YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAID OH I SOMEHOW I WAS THERE BUT THEY WERE NEVER THERE FOR LONG AND BUT HE DID USE THE AIR RAID SHELTER WHICH WAS THE SAME SHELTER THAT WE USED BECAUSE WE WERE IN ADJOINING OFFICES AND BUT YOU KNOW HE HE HARDLY SAW US AND BECAUSE HE POPPED DOWN AND ALL HIS HANDS OR AGE WOULD BE WITH HIM AND BUT VERY I MEAN TO SAY WE DIDN'T FEEL WE WERE LESSER THAN HIM YOU KNOW HE ALWAYS HAD A WORD TO SAY BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY SAY YOU MET HIM YOU KNOW WE PARISIAN NOT ACTUALLY UNTIL I WENT ACROSS TO TO FRANCE BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME HIS ONE OF HIS SIDEKICKS WAS A CAPTAIN ON WHO HAD BEEN THE PORTUGUESE THE NAME WASN'T AN ATTACHE TO THE NAVE WILL REPRESENTATIVE IN LISBON AND AND SO WHEN HE HE JOINED US ON ON THE STAFF OF ADMIRAL PARRY I WAS ATTACHED TO HIM AND HE ALWAYS CALLED ME HIS MANNA DO YOU KNOW I NEVER ACTUALLY HAD SPOKEN TO A PORTUGUESE TO FIND OUT I WAS TOLD IT MEANT FRIEND THAT I WAS ALWAYS HE ALWAYS TOLD PEOPLE IF THEY WANTED SOMETHING GOING LAST MY MALINA BUT HE HE WILL OR A VERY GENTLE VENICE MAN WHO ABOUT WHOM I KNEW NEVER HEARD MUCH ABOUT HIM AT ALL I KNOW ADMIRAL PARRY AM AT THE END OF THE WAR AND I THINK HE HE WAS AN APPLE GROWING KENT THAT'S WHAT IS HIS FOR A TIRE AND THAT'S WHAT HE BUT CAPTAIN OWEN I NEVER KNEW WHAT DID YOU SENSE WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS EXCAVATION TOWARDS TO HOUSE FREE TO IT WERE YOU OH ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE ONLY ALTHOUGH I WASN'T IN THE TYPING POOL ELSE IT WAS AND I KNEW I'D SEEN PAPERS GOING THROUGH AND AND YOU KNEW WHAT THE PLANNING WAS WHEN YOU SEE SOME SECRET WILL JUST DESCRIBE THE SECRECY PROCESS WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO IN TIME YOU WERE AT IT HERE I E WELL IT WAS AN BIGOT WAS THE THE THIRD LEVEL WITH RUSTY ABSOLUTELY I DON'T THINK WE COULD EVER GET THROUGH THERE ARE SPECIAL LINES AND THINGS ON THE TELEPHONE AND IT WAS MOSTLY FOR USE BY TELEPHONE BUT I NEVER REALLY KNEW HOW THEY DECIDED I KNEW WHEN I HAD TO IF I HAD TO MAKE A CALL WHICH LINE I HAD TO USE WHETHER IT WAS THE ORDINARY ONE THE TOP SECRET OR BIGGER BUT I NEVER KNEW WHEN SAY CAPTAIN OWEN WAS WANTING ME TO DO SOMETHING AND HE SAID THAT WILL BE BIGGER HOW HE KNEW IT HAD TO BE BIGGER YOU KNOW THAT WAS SOMETHING KNOWN TO HIM I FIGURE ABOUT TOPSY YES HERE JUST DISLIKE WHAT YOUR JOB WAS IN WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DOING AN PRADO CAMDEN LONDON ARE MAINLY AND DOING THE TEAM ADMIRALS OR CAPTAIN ON WHICHEVER ONE WAS AROUND DOING THE AM THE POST AND UNDER TAKING DICTATION AND THE WHAT PLANNING THEY HAD TO DO IN TERMS OF POST OFF MOST OF THE POST OFFER THIS STUFF WAS THE DIVISION OF THE GERMAN NAVY WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER YOU KNOW WHO WAS GOING TO HAVE WHAT THAT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE OF COURSE THE RUSSIANS WANTED EVERYTHING THIS WAS MUCH FURTHER ON WHEN WE WERE IN BERLIN BUT THE RUSSIANS ALWAYS WANTED ALL THE BIG STUFF YOU KNOW AND AND WE KNEW ALL THE BEST EQUIPMENT WAS IN THE SMALLER DESTROYERS THAN THING SO AND WE WENT FOR THOSE AND SO YOU KNOW THEY WERE WORKING OUT ALL THOSE SORTS OF THINGS AND COURT IT ALL HAD TO GO UP THROUGH THE ADMIRALTY AND BACK AGAIN TO ALL TOOK TIME BUT IT WAS A STRAIGHTFORWARD SHORT AND REPORTING WHAT THE POST OPERATIVE PLOUGHING EVEN BEFORE THE DAY HE DID YOU YOU MEAN YOU KNOW WITH ANY OTHER NOT CHURCH OF ANY OF THE OTHER BIG WEEKS WE NEVER SAW CHURCHYARD AND MONTGOMERY AND WE WHEN WE WERE IN GERMANY IT WAS THE FASHION TO HAVE A DOG AND I NEVER HAD ONE BUT TO MY FRIEND HAD ONE WHICH HE CALLED FRAT BECAUSE THAT OF COURSE WAS NO FRATERNIZATION AND AND I REMEMBER WHEN WE HAD AN OFFICE WE WERE IN FRANKFORT AT THE TIME AND THE OFFICE THERE HAD A SORT OF STAIRCASE GOING UP AND PADDY ALWAYS TOOK FRAT NO YOU MIND BECAUSE THE WAR WAS OVER BUT BY THEN AND THE WE WERE GOING UP STAIRS ONE DAY AND THE SOMEBODY HAD WATCH OUT MONTGOMERY'S COMING AND HE WAS IN THE BUILDING AT SOME MEETING AND HE WAS COMING AGAIN WITH HIS ENTRADGE DOWNSTAIRS AS WE WERE GOING UP YOU SEE AND THEN APPARENTLY HE DIDN'T DO IT IN FRONT OF US BUT WHEN HE GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE HE TOLD HIS ADJUTANT WHO CONTACT WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENDS TO SAY THAT HE DIDN'T WANT DOGS IN THE BUILDING THE TYPICAL SO IF YOU YOU WERE VERY PRIVE TO ALL THIS THAT WE WERE YOU KNOW I ABIDE THE FACULTY DID YOU KNOW AND WELL YES BECAUSE YOU KNOW OF THE DELAY YOU INDEED A YES BUT THE DELAY YOU KNOW THAT WE YOU YOU KNEW THAT THAT IF THIS WAS GONE TO DATE ME THAT IS THAT YOU YES WELL IT WAS IT WAS YOU DIDN'T YOU DIDN'T YOU KNOW THERE WERE ALWAYS THINGS BEING SAID TO PUT YOU OFF SO THAT YOU WENT A HUNDRED PERCENT SURE BUT HER I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYBODY WAS REALLY BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER AND THINGS BUT WE WERE WHEN I WAS AT CHATHAM AND THERE WASN'T WE KNOW WE'D DONE ALL THE WORK WE HAD TO DO WHEN WE WERE WAITING AND WE WERE SENT TO CHERRY PICKING IN THE KENT ORCHARDS AND THAT WAS AMAZING BECAUSE THE ALL THE LANES AND AND ROADS ALL ROUND SORT OF KENT AND ON THE SORT OF AREA GOING DOWN TO THE COAST WAS FULL OF ARMY VEHICLES AND MEN WAITING IN THE ER YOU KNEW THAT THEY WERE THERE READY TO GO BUT I THINK THAT'S HOW I LEARNED RATHER THAN THROUGH THE OFFICE SO AFTER AS YOU GO YOU ON MANTISES YOU MADE A BUSHY BY GOT TO GET IT BECAUSE I DETERMINED HER KNOW THAT I HAVE FROM BUSHY PARK UM WE WERE MOVED BACK TO LONDON AND I WORKED IN PRINCE'S GARDENS THERE AND WE LIVED IN IN ENGLAND'S LANE IN ENGLAND'S LANE IT SORT A SWISS COTTAGE WAY AND LEVERS THE NURSES HOME WHEN I THINK IT WAS A CHERRY CROSS NURSES HOME AND THEY USED THAT FOR REM BIDET I USED TO TRAVEL TRAVEL TO EM PRINCE'S GARDENS FROM THERE AND IT WAS FROM PRINCE'S GARDEN THAT I WAS DRAFTED OVER TO FRANCE CAN YOU EVERY FAN YOU FOUND THAT YOU FOLLOWING THE EXPEDITION BUT I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I FELT THAT I AM STILL THAT MY NAVAL LIFE WAS ANYTHING BUT NAVY YOU KNOW THAT CAUSE I HAD GREAT GREAT IDEAS OF BEING BOATS CREW AS I SAID AND GOING TO SEE WITH A MALE AND SO I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE INLAND AS IT WERE AND BUT AT ONCE I GOT USED TO IT TO EM AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN ADVENTURE AS WELL IN GOING OVER DID YOU SAIL AT ONCE WE WENT OUT YOU KNOW THOSE AND BOATS THEY TOOK THE TROOPS OVER IN WE WENT OVER CAUSE ACTUALLY AND WHEN IT CAME TO IT THE WAR WAS THAT THE ARMY WAS ALMOST IN BERLIN BY THEN SO THEY FELT IT WAS SAFE TO PUT THE GIRLS OVER AND AND WE WENT ACROSS TO A LITTLE TOWN IN NORMANDY CALLED GRUNFELD ON THE WERE DUCKS WE CALLED THEM YOU DUCK THOSE LIKE LANDING CRAFT AND AND I WAS TERRIBLY SIR COMES AT PROVED TO ME I WASN'T TO SAY DESCRIBE THIS ALL OF THE DAY THAT YOU WENT ON THE THE LANDING FRANCE TO FRANCE IS JUST GOING BACK AT THE HONEST OR IN WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF KNOW THAT DAY WHERE DID YOU SAIL FROM AND WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LINE HE SAID TO YOU REMEMBER YET THE WEATHER WASN'T TOO GOOD HENCE THE FACT THAT I WAS AND I SUPPOSE I THINK THEY WERE PROBABLY NEARLY BETWEEN FIFTY AND HUNDREDS OF US GOING NOT ONLY FRIENDS BUT OTHERS AND TIME TO THINK WE WENT FROM THEM ONE AT ONE OF THEM LITTLE PORTS THEY WON'T REALLY PORT IT WERE AROUND THE BULLY RIVER THAT THAT WAY AM WE WERE EXCITED WE DIDN'T YOU KNOW YOU YOU YOU HAD ALL SORTS OF IMAGINATIONS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN CROSSING THE CHANNEL MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW WOULD YOU'D BE ABLE TO SWIM FAR ENOUGH AND THAT THE YOU KNOW THEY WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WATER WHEN WE GOT THE OTHER SIDE LIKE WHO SEE THE MEN YOU KNOW TRAILING OUT WITH ALL THE LEFT THROUGH WATER THEY MANAGED TO BEACH US SO WE WERE QUITE DRY WHEN WE GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU KNOW THE FRENCH ACTUALLY ENORMITY WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING THEY WERE VERY PLEASED TO SEE US THEY WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN MY VIEW TO THE ONE WE MET IN PARIS WAS THE OBVIOUSLY WATER OH YES YES YOU KNOW THE CAUSE IT WOULD BE AFTER D DAY OF COURSE THAT WE WENT ACROSS THOUGH SEEMS WERE STILL PRETTY AND BROKEN YOU KNOW ALL THE SORT OF FRONT LINE HOUSES AND THINGS WERE ALL BASHED ABOUT A THEY'D BEEN BODBARDED OF COURSE FROM THE SEA GROWS TO SET OUT THERE AND YOU SEE WAR WAS A DAY YOU IT WAS A WAR'S OWN WELL IT WAS IT WAS JUST A SORT OF GETTING OFF POINT FOR MOVING PEOPLE ON BEHIND THE ARMY I THINK IT WAS FELT TO BE A REASONABLE PLACE TO START MOVING CAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF EQUIPMENT AS WELL WE DIDN'T BUT THE ARMY AND AND THE FORCE ON THE DATE FOR THAT MATTER THAT ALL HAD EQUIPMENT TO MOVE UP WITH US AND I THINK RATHER WOULD PROBABLY AT A A LITTLE TOWN WAS CONSIDERED YOU KNOW THEY HAD A GOOD ROAD NOT GOOD BUT THE TRANSPORT SITUATION MOVING STUFF WAS REASONABLE BUT VERY BASIC LIVING CONDITIONS YOU KNOW WE HAD NO WAS RUNNING WATER OR A WE HAD SORT OF THINGS LIKE YOUR TRIP ON WITH THE CANVAS BAGS IN ONE WHICH WE USED THIS WASHING MACHINE OR A FOR WASHING AT ONE O ER OH BUT IT WAS LIKE A CAMP IGNORE FROM A LIVING POINT OF VIEW AND VERY LITTLE WORK WE HAD AT THAT TIME WHAT YOU JUST WRITING TO TELL PRINCES IS A NEST ACKNOWLEDGES OH YES IS THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF IT BUT NOT IN THE GROUP I WAS WITH YOU KNOW THAT THAT ACTUALLY THE FIRST PEOPLE TO GO OVER WERE THE COMMUNICATORS AND THE TELEPHONE OPERATORS AND SO ON AND AND OF COURSE THEY WERE STILL THE ENGINEERS WERE STILL FITTING UP FIELDS AND EQUIPMENT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND THEY WERE A LOT OF TRENDS IN THAT GROUP TREMENDOUS SLUMBER AND AND FROM GRANFIELD AND YOU KNOW THEY FOUND THAT THE WORK THEY WANTED ME TO DO WAS MORE CENTRED BACK IN LONDON SO I WAS SHIPPED BACK TO THEM LONDON AND TO WAIT UNTIL THE A PREPARED WHAT WE NEEDED AND I HAD TO HELP DO THAT AND AND WE WENT THEN TO PARIS BUT I WENT FROM LONDON FROM ENGLAND SLAIN WENTWORTH TO AND PARIS ON MY OWN AND THEN I REALLY WAS HAD NOT BEEN ANYWHERE ON MY OWN BEFORE AND THE THEY I ONCE MET WHEN I GOT TO AND THE GARDEN OR AS I WENT OVER ON THE TRAIN AND BY ANOTHER WREN WHO HAD BEEN OVER AND THEN WE WERE I WAS BILLETED IN WORKED IN THE CHATEAU IN AND BUT IT'S A SUBURB OF PARIS ANYHOW CABLE AND AND I WORKED THERE FOR A VERY SHORT TIME AND THEN THE AND ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP WERE FOLLOWING ON BEHIND THE ARMY AND WE WENT FROM AND PARIS TO FRANKFURT AND AND I DIDN'T ENJOY FRANKFORT VERY MUCH BECAUSE AND THERE WASN'T MUCH TO DO BY NOW YOU KNOW MOST OF THE PLANNING HAD BEEN DONE AND LIFE BECAME RATHER A SORT OF THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY POINT ON WHAT WE WERE DOING WE'VE DONE THIS ALL YOU KNOW AND SO IT WAS A BIT OF A PLAYGROUND IS A ENTERITIS AFTER THE WALL YE RABBIS AND TROOPS THAT HAD ENTERED BERLIN AND AND WE WERE BACK IN PARIS TO THE SORT OF JUST AS THE WAR WAS ENDING AND YET IT HAD ENDED BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME IN PARIS AND WHAT WE WORTHY AND FASHION WAS YOU KNOW THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HATS MADE OUT OF CELESANE PAPER YOU KNOW SWEET PAPERS AND THINGS THAT THE WOMEN HAD MADE THEY SEEMED UNTOUCHED BY THE WAR IN PARIS THEY DIDN'T MUCH LIKE IT I DON'T SEE I THINK THE GERMANS HAVE GIVEN THEM QUITE A GOOD TIME YOU EMPLOY THOSE BOYS NO I MET ADMIRAL PARRY WHEN I GOT TO PARIS WILL GO AS AS A PERSON VERY QUIET I'LL KNOW YOU DIDN'T REALLY FEEL YOU KNOW HE COULD HITCH ANYBODY LETTER TO KILL ANYBODY BUT ON AND OR EVEN DISCIPLINE ANYBODY HE WAS ALWAYS VERY GENTLEMAN AND VERY LIKE TO WORK FOR BUT VERY CLEVER OF COURSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WANTED WHAT IS DESCRIBED THIS SORT OF THE WORK AND RELATIONSHIP AT ONE YOU DID FOR HIM AND WHAT THE PURPOSE OF YOU BEING WAS AND YOU MEET IN BUT YOU SEE MOST OF THE GROUT HE HE REALLY WOULD HAVE COMMUNICATED TO CAPTAIN OWN MOST OF WHAT HE WANTED CAUSE HE'D BE OFF DOING SOMETHING ELSE AND BUT SO THAT CAPTAIN OWEN WAS REALLY THE PERSON WHO WAS GIVING ME WORK WHEN THERE WAS WORK TO BE DONE BUT AT ADMIRAL PARRY CERTAINLY AND WAS VERY APPROACHABLE AND THE HE MIXED WITH US THERE WAS NO SORT OF OFFICERS AND OTHERS AND EVERYBODY MIXED AND THE IS A DIFFICULT MAN TO DESCRIBE RARELY WERE AS SOON AS HE IS GOING OVER HERE YOU KNOW BUT WHEN WE WERE IN BERLIN YOU YOU KNOW BERLIN AT ALL IN THE LAKES THAT THAT THE FANCY THAT THE LAKES THAT ARE ON THE OUTSKIRTS FOR WHEN WE WE WERE LIVING IN IN WHAT HAD BEEN THE JAPANESE EMBASSY IN BERLIN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AND IT WAS IN THAT DISTRICT WHERE THE LAKES WERE BUT I ALWAYS SAID THE VAN LAKES AND THEY WOULD FREEZE OVER IN THE WINTER THAT WE HAD A WINTER THERE AND YOU YOU KNOW THE ADMIRAL WOULD ARRANGE SKATING PARTIES AND THE YOU KNOW THE COURT THE ICE THERE SO THICK AS IT'S SO COLD THAT YOU COULD HAVE BARBECUES ON THE ICE AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE LIFE BECAME A BIT SUPERFICIAL AND LATTERLY WHEN THERE WASN'T MUCH WORK TO DO YOU KNOW YOU REALLY FELT YOU SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE ON WORK HOW DID YOU GO FROM PARIS IS A RACE YOUR RAILWAYS ARE YOU IN VEHICLES OR OWN NAVAL JEEPS MOST OF THE TRAVELLING WE SAID THE ONLY ONLY THING BUT WHEN I WENT FROM FRANKFURT TO BERLIN I HAD BEEN HOME ON LEAVE AND WHEN I GOT BACK AND IT WAS TO FIND THAT I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY THEY COULDN'T AND NOTIFIED ME THEY COULDN'T GET HOLD OF ME TO LET ME KNOW THAT THE MAIN PARTY HAD GONE ON TO BERLIN AND THAT WHEN I GOT BACK TO FRANKFORD I HAD TO GO IN REPORT TO ONE OF THE ARMY OFFICERS TO GET TRANSPORT AND WHEN I GOT THERE I FOUND A MESSAGE TO SAY THAT GENERAL LIES IN THE HOUSE CHAUFFEUR HAD MARRIED ONE OF OUR FRIENDS ONLY THEY WERE VERY FRIENDLY FI WHEN AND THAT HE LET THEM HAVE HIS HOUSE IN AND NEAR FRANKFURT AND FOR THEIR HONEYMOON AND THEY WERE BOTH DUE BACK IN BERLIN AND THEY WOULD GIVE ME A LIFT SO I WENT BREEZING UP THE AUTOBAHN FRONT FRANKFORT AND BERLIN AND GENERALIZED THEM HAS CAR THEN WHAT WAS OILY WHAT WAS THOSE MEN ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED THERE THAT REALLY DID SHAPE ME WHEN I SAW IT YOU KNOW THERE WAS ALMOST EVERY BUILDING WE SAW WAS AN DESTRUCTS DESTROYED AND THERE WERE THESE AND THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY OLD WOMEN BUT THEY LOOKED OLD BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL HUMPED UP YOU KNOW IN DARK CLOTHES WITH WHEELBARROWS CLEARING THE STREETS WORKING SO HARD AND LITTLE FOOD YOU KNOW THEY WERE WORKING WITH VERY LITTLE STRENGTH TURN I MUST GIVE THE GEMS AND SAID YOU THEY DID WORK HARD TO GET BERLIN BACK DID YOU GO TO THE ROBOT A OR THE VERY ONE YEAR REMOTE WELL THAT AGAIN WAS MORE LIKE NOTORIOUS TRIP YOU KNOW WE I'D BEEN TRYING TO THINK WHAT OUR OFFICE IN BERLIN WAS LIGHTENED YOU BY THEN OF COURSE IT WAS THE CONTROL COMMISSION AND AND I CAN'T VISUALIZE IT AT ALL IT AN ABSOLUTE BLANK IN MY MEMORY I CAN REMEMBER THE REMERIE THE JAPANESE EMBASSY AND I CAN REMEMBER GOING ON THE TRAM FROM THERE TO THE OFFICE BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OFFICE AT ALL AND I AM BECAUSE I WAS THERE FOR NEARLY A YEAR BUT SO WE WE WENT TO AND SEE THE BUNKER YOU KNOW WHERE HITLER WAS KILLED AND THAT WAS STILL IN IN YOU KNOW PRETTY ROUGH STATE YOU KNOW BITS OF FURNITURE WERE STILL THERE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TIED UP AND WHAT WAS YOUR SENTIMENT TO WAS THE GERMAN SO SO WELL IF IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE A I FOUND THEM VERY HELPFUL BUT THEM AND YOU KNOW I QUITE LIKE THEM AND BUT OF COURSE THEY THEY HAD A LOT TO GAIN FROM US IN THE WAY OF FOOD AND AND AND SO ON AND THE RUSSIANS OF COURSE WERE THEY THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE STORY GOES THAT THE MAIN RUSSIAN ARMY THEY TOOK BERLIN THEY PULLED THEM BACK AND THEY REPLACED THEM WITH THE SORT OF THIRD LINE WERE MONGOLIANS AND THEY WERE PRETTY ROUGH AND AND THEN ON ONE OCCASION COMING HOME FROM THE OFFICE A COUPLE VERY LATELY THEY USED TO DRINK AN AWFUL OFF ANY BOOS THEY GET OLDER COUPLE OF VERY DRUNK RUSSIANS STARTED WE WERE WALKING HOME FROM THE OFFICE OF BERLIN TWO OR DIG AND AND THEY STARTED GETTING THEIR GUNS OUT AND SHOOTING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND WE HAD TO JUMP IN THE HEDGE AND AND AFTER THAT TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY AND AFTER THAT AND THEY PUT FAIRLY STRONG MARINE PRESENCE ON THE RUN A SORT OF GUARD ON AND WE WENT ALLOWED TO TRAVEL ON OUR OWN AND SO WE PRETTY OKAY ON TRANSPORT WE GOT THE TRAM OR MURA AS IF YOU STARTED WALKING WE HAD AN A GERMAN COOK IN TERENRY AND AND HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO BE PLEASANT TO US BUT HE WAS BECAUSE OF COURSE HE HE USED TO COLLECT OUR USED TEA BAGS TO TAKE THEM HOME AND AND HE KNEW THAT HE HE DIDN'T YOU KNOW TREAT US ALL PROPERLY HE'D GET TAKEN OFF AND WE'D GET SOMEONE ELSE AND HE'D LOSE OUT ON HIS BIT OF PIECES HE WAS GEFFY AND WE ALSO HAD AN
