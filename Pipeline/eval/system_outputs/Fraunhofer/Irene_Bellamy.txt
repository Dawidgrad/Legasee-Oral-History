oh my name's irene that lately i ran just him where are you from i was from bristol from the fish ones area where i was born um i went to school in bristol and starts at my work after school imbecile that however you when war broke out um well i was born in nineteen nineteen hundred twenty what what was life like here in bristol and what will happen just tell me a bit about his schooling and and and just life in bristol so i had to stand who you are yeah um i originally went to a small private school um and then went through colston from there and um it is the bristol itself i found rather doubtfully and that it was all pubs and churches that's how it seemed to me and that they were let alone they fund things that there are for young people to their a we spent most of our time either get into the are free time gate into the sinaloa oh playing some kind of games and i belong to you and various hockey teams and tender slops um and um during during the war um officially worked very long hours um yeah right shows that you went looking for you much leisure fung and i move because of the bristol wits during that time um i was put by the firm they didn't want us in the danger of central bristol and so on and so they took over a cottage and shivering saw brian i lived in shipping celebrate for a couple of years um that was quite good fun man she is a sort of village life lots going on but i've always had a yen to to go into the navy when the war broke out a mainly because i have friends who had the joined the services um was it was it renders over any other service yeah i didn't want to join you in a voice yes or no no leave my particular friend went into the wake and she had very interesting time as out in washington a working for roon met not naval therefore with the rain was the right choice yes and like the uniform too yeah just show me a bit about yet to me what you are doing there and i'm disposed to work and stuff well um as secretary till the chief design or the beginning um it was a question of doing typing i would dictate his design report because it had all have to go up to the air ministry for approval uh because they've been looking for a an order for these planes of course and it was typing only sheets of description of these planes um and that i mean to say he was a very undisciplined man in that he left everything to the last minute so one was working quite late at night very often to get it done until the deadline that the ministry of sat and it is now basil henderson and he designed a small plane coldly um what they call it um the handy it it was a break down of his name but it was basel him it'll come to me but it was um round about the time that there was um lafitte chap designing those small planes um i can't think of his name a but that would have been in about nineteen thirty seven thirty eight did you have the sense that the war was coming um not really i mean to say at the boys let we used to meet and mixed with fort were mostly air force tight or gain a interested in the air force and we knew that if little five oh one squadron lie at feltham most of them flew with um i'm ly you at times that from their conversation that things are getting very near the term not really i know not if we were putting out the barricades or anything what about the outbreak of war do you remember that i do of um we whereat schoenfeld live and rome than that sunday when they announced it at watching these lads in their planes taking off purely for exercise sir any did things change in bristol when war broke out what was the changed you remember i can honestly safe as most of my life was spent between fish ponds and yet you know i very rarely went the other way towards town and didn't really get any feeling of what things were like you know i read about some of the ghastly things that happened in the bombing in or the loss of life um but it didn't affect me directly um my parents had a shop in fish bones and let's look at going and learn quiet sort of way did you see the blitz did you say where you when were you in the eight when yes i've yeah yeah and that was one of the reasons why the from moved us to live in the eight so that we didn't have the business of traveling um but we did have a daylight raid in in yates and that was very traumatic um there were a late they sends a single plain and his family were all working away quite happily in the arabs are room went and uh i've just been taught how to play bridge but by the friend who went into the air force and then we didn't take any notice of the array charges we never had anything and suddenly there was a nice little march explosion on the whole building shook and what's happened a single plain that come in patently came in from somewhere in the northern france area that the germans had um apples and had flown up the bristol channel to somewhere norse of gloucester picked up the railway line on ye eight runs along the railway line if you know the building and flew down and dropped the strip of bombs alone the factory fortunately a couple of them didn't go off and i think it was about fifty seven people were killed and it was my first experience of seeing a dead body because i knew most of the people in the fact of because of who i was working for and one of the other people living in the house in the interesting sabra was woman called sister hobbs who became quite well known for the work she lived in lap blitz and she just got hold of and she's have come on we've got to go up to the brick factory she sends to identify these people who've been killed and you know i was taking on muscles i it was nineteen forty one should i twenty two at twenty two to see all these listened grudge bodies and i haven't seen the dead body before and that was very dramatic was that you think of catalyst for thinking i want to join become a render no i don't think so let's that was quietly simmering away and i think the capitalist in the end was when my boss moved he went to affirm which gave you may know of booze and hawks they um he wasn't amused issue we hadn't made musical instruments cosette was to the job they dared originally they were making spare parts for some of our gun turrets and they um found that he was a man who could design what they wanted and um they got him um they had tons it's him and when he left i will isn't too happy with the person who got the job and i saw i want to move but i had to work quite hard to get into the rents because the quota others in reserved occupation i was going to ask was areas are assumed it was a reserved occupation see you have to go through the procedure to get out yes and they went as the friends weren't open for recruitment anyhow and at that time we were being a but a draw lots poses a word for the by war artists a man called leopold freedman who i haven't been able to run to us since i've tried because he didn't like a mural of people working in the factory and it went to the aehm nashua what's the one inch fog is not natural outcome in and found the square um and um i the city and while he was drawing me and talking to him and i said i wanted to join the rams and the problem of liver no vacancies alive is reserved archivist so he gave me the name of a woman again i've forgotten her name but she was the head of the ministry of labor in london so i go off to london to see this woman and she told me she told me this autumn inside secret that i ought to be able to get in fairly soon because the men's we're expanding and they expanded very rapidly and i got isn't very easily said that i have to wait till the doors open cuts the lords of the admiralty didn't want women ill as a reluctantly took the room at the beginning of the war but for your marriage it was a man's service wasn't for women brilliant so what was the process than from transitioning from being a secretary and yet to becoming a red for you remember that yeah i remember uh yknow having my pay person to being sent to leeds because because they suddenly expanded they had to oak from new training their foes i was in my early trenches and um i had what they call a white paper which was the recommendation for a commission as soon as you were interviewed the religion in a most girls have to wait and work awhile but i was older at last they show me as a possible admin office where they did actually but then i went from leeds after i did my basic training to rochester which is really the chatham now i had seen myself his boat's crew you know in an because i was a stole and i wanted to go to plymouth witness that um but the navy had other ideas so they sent me a should be waiting to go to training for that been officer at chatham rarely anyhow if they put me in what's called the regulating office which is you know where you mamma to people coming in and going out on telephones and i always remember the first officer who was the man in charge was a very very door woman and she was the daughter of a suddenly called lady burton shore who lived in hove and every saturday afternoon lady burton short would ring up her daughter desperate chance and i was put on the telephone light level never worked to those plugging telephone workmen the those and the course ladybird shore comes through the limbs of cadet king wasn't me confident lady lucas what though i did very middle of that conversation i pull the plug out she said so i had to go in she called me a little she had on the telephone for such as it was me ma'am said you are nothing but a broken reed i saw one has ever called me a brooklyn rigging fit for up up up did you let it be as a world of good i thought i was god's gift to the navy you say that but that that remark really has stuck with me all my life sit where you will you scared me for i'd but we were chatham rating yes i'll get said you don't like but um at first i was not command it will did you go to chatter well not only in tilted to visit because we were billeted in rochester and because i was doing the ant men work in the office the officer was attached to the billet how did you find keep moving ran the country the benighted bristow this point um i not very far now that was another thing you didn't travel fire at the holidays were was the furthest we went steadily in his house loaves but i haven't been to london um well i had been france on a school trip um wasn't uh but no not very far we went very well i will only how as a family you know why had to cut our corners so after rochester then where did you where did you go then i'm were well i was at rochester um the first off assize was telling a cold beer broken really um i was in the um so what do they call it now uh sort of the office which allocated postings to the goat got all the girls there were waiting to be sent somewhere um and i was there and nothing came in cause i was able to trouble the different things that came in from the admiralty nothing came in i was interested a libel down for at them and then i found that the due out miller had to go to lois laugh till the captain's office where they trained admin offices and uh i found that there was a long waiting list and i said well i didn't join the navy just sit in an office wait for that so i'd i'm just gives me off to just go and i said no so they said well you realize you'll go to the bottom of the list i shall religion they joined to have a commission anyhow yknow i joined in doing so she said to me if you see anything coming through that's a teleprinter in those that's um let me know and i'll see i shall tell all i know is i don't want to work in london a gentleman where else i go and you know i'd like to sit with my shorthand and the sort of general office were okay she said so aden comes it is it the time when general lies in how was on getting to be quite well known as the commander and he set off if you remember shave um i looked it was something came in with a n c x f stroked shave and i thought well that's interesting and at the a m c x f was the allied naval commander expeditionary force and that was admiral ramsay and i saw that sounds interesting and i said i didn't realize how could i had my name put up for that vacancy and so she agreed and yknow you'll have to take a chance what other applications they had and then i got it as i said where is it so she sobel to start with you'll have to go to law foot square in london which is the headquarters of shave and the an she exit group were collecting there um and they were mostly at rennes who were going to do the da planning but i got there because i'd put him free and shakes stroked shave i got attached to the letters for apple parry came and chill admiral perry who cheerfully british we hadn't started the day but they were always or already post operative planning but um i couldn't believe this i thought when we haven't won the war where are they planning for the future cruise and that's what i was caught up in lip from then on i was attached to him and sent a bushy park and heart the chair dat hertfordshire oh it's near hampton court palace and it was generalizing has headquarters for they were collecting all the more administrative people there you'll know well the troops were being collected around calculating sussex and places sorry it's my nerves and um i so why don't want to go to london but anyhow in the end they said well you learn to behold held there until um well i was totally held their day i remember sitting on the wall outside norfolk house which is where the london group where and told to wait on somebody would pick me up because some lint or let became highly secretive the city left a lonely red rose by naval case and that the girl and the jeep came little being rapidly um square and an american stop by many a so there you ran irene battle may go on a bushy park will i shall i don't wear our gullies i've just been told to sit on this war so he said he got me aboard his chief and we went through that wasn't far from norfolk to get out of love that lynch bushy park oh allah course when i get for she parked i'm the only rain there because it was a separate units of the big group literate law for gauss ah what year was then a b forty four hours and forty four forty fellow here are just described the set effort was she park and what you are doing there before d day um well bushy park um it is i presume it's a sort of lava is a very large park and in it were porter cabins and which um by then you you'd got see british and french uh i will tell you americans the liver falsehoods not really is canadians it was there were few but not many that i was thinking of the the group that they split germany opens region was bitten led the british russia but i can't remember russian was being at bushy park has in't they linked up later um but i remember being in a in one of these we have our office and this is where i just doesn't she will couldn't so i met him but erm the little bugs had started flying and then why we laid they got to lay her bushy park in their sights and they got very near us but so there were arid shelters built specially on the lot of the americans particularly the women and the american army had never experienced anything like it before i just went to pieces if there was a and they arranged a live there were terribly love a slop but i i quite enjoyed being missile did it was a different lifestyles altogether their best would reach a yknow the equipment they gave us you lower and lower hygiene listless within um so i wish i was under a h yes supervision somebody called lady bracknell book i think she became quite a power in the land afterwards from her political point of view but aehm she was in charge of us and she the log bridge enters her because she if she used my post which caused the navy leave your post but the closer because i will andres yes rule on our post so filled and lady brett local was made a point of reading and remembering what was in the loves always sydney home for money ah is she as she was always saying you know you don't use bomb that you've got plenty you know you should manage on what you've got that was seventy six week though from from there did you meet eyes in now well yes and those i was talking about the doodle bugs um and if he was on site in his office he didn't come very often cause a costly i'm his responsibility was enormous and the places you lead people seldom eisenhower was there but they wouldn't have there for long but he did use the air raid shelter which was the same shelter that we used because we ran the adjoining offices but you know he he he hardly saw us because he'd pulled down and all his entourage dry with him um but i mean to say what we feel we will lessen the heavy hello he always had a word to say that you can't really say you met him there and when did a hobo parry come on to the scene um not actually until i went to cross to to france because in the meantime his one of his psychics was the captain loam who had been the um portuguese the name of the chafe chair filled the naval representative in lisbon um and so when he he joined us on on the staff of admiral perry i was attached to him and he always called me his molina june i've never actually had spoken to a portuguese to find out others told it meant friend but i was always he wished to people if they wanted something very last magdalena that he behaved moves a lot of a gentle very nice man who about whom i knew never heard much about him at all i know admiral powdery um the end of the war um i think he was an apple growing kennels that's what he is a his free time but that's what he did but captain loan i never knew what did you sense what did you know about this escalation towards the day how how sort of privy to it were you oh absolutely because you know although i wasn't in the typing pool as it was are you i'd seen papers going through and and you knew what the planning whirls what can you say was top secret watches described the secrecy process what do you have to do in order to be yet let it ere it that a well it was um i'm bigger to whistle the third level which was the absolutely i don't think we could ever get through the especial line was incidents on the telephone and it was mostly for use by telephone uh but but i never really knew how they decided um i i knew when i had to if i happen to like coal which line i hate to us that it was the ordinary one the top secret or bigger but i never knew when say captain lowered was wanting me to do something he said that'll be bigger how he knew it had to be vigour though that was clumsy known to him is bigger above topsy yes yeah just describe what your job was some of you actually doing um predominant i was in the water will make the um during the the um admirable o captain though whichever one was around doing the um the postal older taking dictation loder what planning they had to do in terms of post of most of the post operative stuff was the division of the german lavie when the war was over you know who's gonna have walked on lap was interesting because for the russians wanted everything that this this was much further on when we were in the live that the russians always wanted all the big stuff you love him and we knew all the best equipment was only smaller destroyers of leaking so we went for those um so ill they will work out all those sorts of things and cause it all had to go up through the admiralty of alone back again so thought at the time but she just straightforward shorthand reporting the post operative ploughing aehm before data yeah did you did you ever meet any yknow with any other that churchill any of the other big wigs big big levin saw churchill um montgomery we went we were in germany it was the fashion to have a dog and i never have won the two my friend had won which she called frat he goes after course was like fraternization oh and i remember when we had an office we were in frankfurt at the time and the office there have a little staircase going up and patio was took frat to work with certain now remind dickens was over but by then and uh we're going upstairs well nail on the somebody so watch out montgomery is coming and he was in the building that some meeting and he just coming again with his entourage downstairs as we're going up you see and then apparently i ah if he didn't do it in front of us that some when he got back to his office he told us adjutant to collins hacked whoever was responsible for the rebels to say that he didn't want dogs in the building so if you you were very privy to all this stuff like when did you know is gonna be june the fifth or sixth why did you know that um well yes because you have the delay you indeed i yeah felt of the delay that your love of yeah but you say you knew that that this was gonna be the day that the valleys are happening to you yes what was it you didn't you didn't know they were always things being said put you off so that you went a hundred percent shore sir i don't suppose anybody was really because of the weather and things but we were when i was at chatham and there wasn't yknow we've done all that work we have to do if we were waiting weaver said cherry picking and we cannot orchards and that was amazing because the ball the lanes of roads all rounds of kenton only sort of area going down to the coast was full of army vehicles and men waiting on the uh you knew that they were they're ready to go but i think that's how i learn rather than a shrew the office so after bushy caught you em back to shatter into the or back over to a place she bought gotta get that because i'm kind of now that i am from bushy park um we were moved back to london and uh i worked in princes gardens there and we lived in any angels lane and angles laying that as soldiers swiss cottage way i'm leaving the nurses home nothing it was charing cross nurses home and they use that for ren visit i know these for travel go travel to um princes gardens from there and it was from prince's garden was that i was drafted over to france can you remember how you felt when you found that you've begun following the expedition i was i was a bit disappointed because i felt that might lie i am still that my naval life was anything but navy you know that that that i had great gate ideas of being boat's crew as i said i'm going to see missile bay or um so i've just a bit disappointed as if it was going to the inland as it were um but once i've got used to it earlier and there was a certain adventurers well in going over did you say l to france we went out you know those some legislature the troops over and let them and move we job because actually um when it came to it the war was that the army was almost live in berlin by them so they felt it was safe for the girls over and we went across to a little town in normandy called granville on the wood ducks we called them yelling g q k lose of light landing craft well i was terribly sick i may say proves to me i wasn't just say described the source of the day that you went on there the landing cross to france so just go back and a bit on historian of what you remember of yknow that they waited you sail from and what was a weather like essential can you remember as the weather was too good hence the fact that privacy um i suppose i shouldn't know promptly nearly between fifty and hundreds of us gay of a not only rennes with others um trying to say we went through them one one of the um little ports they won't really ports that were around the beautifully river that that way um we're very excited which isn't it low you you you had all sorts of imaginations of what might happen crossing the channel much think you learn will you be able to swim far enough and the you know i think we just don't have to go through water only got the other side like you see the men you live fraley up with all this after water they managed to beaches so we will quite dry when we got to the other side yeah there's a french actually a normal day were very accommodation limit they pleased to see as they were very different in my view till the ones we met in paris what what was it obviously water on oh yes yeah you'll know the um because it would be after leader of course it we went across so satan's was still pretty um broken even i will all the m so the frontline houses lings we're all bashed about and could they be bombarded of course from the sea and and and grown there was the set up there and did ye yknow you silly the war was one basically anyone it was a walls and at well it was it was just a sort of getty off point from moving people on behind the army i think it was felt to be a reasonable place to start moving because we have a lot of equipment as well we didn't but the army and uh yeah fell silent debut for that matter they all had equipment to move up with us um lashing granville probably of as a little town unless considered you know they had um good roan not good but the transports situation moving stuff was the will but very basic living conditions you know we have no was running water over the blue by had sort of things like ill tripod with canvas bags and one look we used as washing was she a low um the washing what was that oh but it was like the camping rarely from a living point of view and very little work we have as that time and what were you just rise you into the telly princes or anything like that was there any technology oh yes as there was a lot of it but not in the group i was with him that actually they first people to go over well the communicators the telephone operators alter all um and of course they must fill the engineers for sale fishing up field um equipment when they arrived and they were lot of a red was in that group tremendous slumber and from granville yknow they found that the work lay wanted me to do was more senses back lovers i was shit that little london wait a little ladies a prepared what we need is i had to help lula um um we went then a to paris uh but i went from london from angels lane where it was to um paris on my own and then i i really was a lot been anywhere on my own before and uh they i once met will i got two am the garden nor so i went over on the train by another red who'd feel over and then we were i was villages and worked in the chateau in the um well it's a suburb of paris and they are global one and i were left for a very short time and then the um administrative group were following on behind the army and we went from um paris to frankfurt and um i didn't enjoy frankfurt very much because um there wasn't much to do by now you know most of the planning had been done and life became rather sort of well i didn't seem to be any point in what we the jury why janet's all yknow so it was a bit of a playground at the end of this after the war yeah lady says that the um troops and had entered berlin we were back in paris so a sort of justice of war was ending and if the first and if it had ended because one of the things that struck me in in paris what was the fashion was you know the most beautiful hats made out of cellophane paper you know what sleep papers ling's that the women it made they seemed untouched by the war in paris they didn't much like whom i think the german given him quite a good time you with admiral perry then at this point though a matter admiral perry when i got him to paris and who was there either as a person very quiet and ill now you and you didn't really feel it yknow he could he shed my body level kill everybody but uh and all even disciplinary body havent always very gentle little a very large to work for uh but very clever of course he oh you'll see what was his name and what does describe the sort of their working relationship what were you did for him and what was the purpose of you being there was jim it grind you seem most earnestly the ground he he rarely wouldn't have communicated to captain loan most of what he wanted could he be after in something else but a says the captain was really the person who was giving me work when there was work to be done but add admiral perry certainly um was very approachable he mixed will as there was no sort of officers and others and everybody makes and uh if it isn't such a good plan to describe bailiff as soon as they described yeah you know busy when we were in the little girl now but a little atoll in the lakes that that the advance of the lakes that on the outskirts or when we leave and living in what had been the um japanese embassy in berlin and most beautiful house and it was in that district where the lakes where i was sent advancing the lakes and they would freeze over and lewinsky because we had a winter there and you know the admirable arranged skating parties cylinder you know the palace i swear so sick as it so cold that you should have barbecues on the ice you know that's life became a bit superficial latterly when there wasn't much work to do you know you really felt you should be somewhere some work and how did you get from paris into frankfurt then you are rare waits for you in vehicles or oh and naval jeeps um most of the travelling was as the only one thing when i went from frankfurt to berlin i had been home on leave uh and when i got back it was to find that i don't know why but they they couldn't um notify me they couldn't get hold of me to let me know that the main party had gone on to berlin and that when i got back to frankfurt i have to go and report to one of the army officers to get transport and when i got there i found a message to say that generalized and the houses chauffeur had married what'll of our restless under they were very friendly firewood and that he let him have his house ill um near frankfurt so that honeymoon and they were both due back in berlin on and they would give me a lift so i went breeze up the autobahn from frankfurt the lint and generalizing husk ah based on what was born in light of what was postwar absently devastation yeah that really didn't shapely will i saw it you know those almost every building we saw was um destruction destroyed and there were these and they weren't necessarily old women that they looked old till they were all hunched up you learn dark clothes was wheelbarrows clearing the streets working so hard and little food you'll know they were working with very little strains but jim unloved gives the germans says you they did work hard to get berlin back did you go to the brandenburg gay or the yeah yeah yeah well and that again was more like a tourist trip you'll know why i'd been trying to sing what our office in berlin was lightened you buy them of course it was control commission and um i come visualizing the tall it's an absolute blank in my memory i can remember the memory the japanese mc uh i like and remember going on the tram from there to the office by i can't remember the office at all a lot of till i was there for nearly a year that's a but yeah we we we went to um see the a bunker you'll know where it let was kill and that was still in you know pretty rough state you know bits of furniture was still there and have had been tied it up um what was your sentiment towards the germans at the time well if it it was interesting because l i find that very helpful but then and you know i quite like flame but a horse they they have a lot to gain from us away of food so um the russians course where they the problem because if the story that it was that the main russian army that took berlin they pulled them back and they replace them with limbs whistle of served lynley who were mongolians and they were pretty rough and on one occasion coming home from the office a couple very likely they used to drinking or fall off one boozer they kept over a couple of very drunk russians slot we were walking home from the office in berlin she digs and um they started getting their guns out and shouting all over the place and we have to jump in the hedge and and after that to keep out of their way and after that they put fairly strong marine presence on the regular are a sort of god on and we went allowed to travel on our own um so real pretty okay on transport forgot the traveller mirror isn't he started walking we had um of german cook and learn marie um and he found it difficult to be pleasant to us but he was recalled her course a he used to collect are used tea bags and take them home and he knew this feat he doesn't you know teresa saw properly he'd get taken off and we'll get somewhere else and he'd lose out on his but some jesus he was getting and we also had an interesting made francesca who was german dr at all jewish and um she had had a very bad time she had legitimately because well i seldom jitterbugs it will it was her boyfriend not on a jail nor a russian a frightened at once and she had this baby in the cellar which she was hiding from because the genitals are still looking for jews even after the war and uh and he had a it was a russian soldier who actually helped her half her baby or in the cellar and you know who really rescued her and then of course the british it should we were in the british regional goals but from francisca um used have lessons is in a german for us it's she was alleged located j ju you can go to potsdam yes i'm they passed out conference was held well i was in berlin and admiral perry of course heather till the main purpose of pulsed out was to sell to finalize the breakup of the german navy um and uh i would was captain though and because of course based on their work on the navy to contribute to that um uh i didn't go into the actual meeting whore cos it's quite small actually our surprise our team back since and had another look at the inner lateral yes it is more um but some i i went this time you lo there because i was driving as well you know so well i'll grew um a z captain says you'd like to go you can go but you won't be able to go until the carbon froze that's because you know it was a significant moment thither did you know it was a significant moment in history oh yes i think you you you and you knew that yeah you know you saw solemn churchill the inlet in yellow just as though you were a sorceress lace year oh you talked a bit earlier about how the the navy knew more about the german navy than the russians the rushes wanted to carry his the bricks wanted the destroyer did we said yknow just recap on that was there any more of that discussion sort of pre potsdam that you can recall or was it also done and dusted by them no i don't think they they sort of their there was another um admiral miles was someone who appeared on the scene that therefore potsdam and he had a lot to do with the you know sorting out the german navy um but um c i forgot my your question muslim just was there was the more discussion of our oh you know now we've heard about the v two rockets we should be getting those rather yeah well you know i say i think it was all done before hanley um i don't remember i know there was and i can't remember what was that there were supposed to have been an incident len now ecosystem um i i don't mean church all i mean atley because it was it the potsdam carved fruit yknow that lit churchill um lost his seat and that leak came in and that means that made a change of foreign secretary and it was offices them loud the big man socialist he was at this foreign secretary and he is reported to have got cross over something at potsdam and bang the table and water you know level glasses of water a witch oh i gather that the russians didn't take pick up this man you know wisely chose to have his way dangled a at the work up a little we got to berlin was really quite interesting uh but once you know the final established were being pushed on the dividing of of the city into regions and seemed slightly breakup up the nave of the gentleman navy there really wasn't much interesting to loot um and it really is become a sort of almost a playground just tell me about v j day yeah while we were in in berlin when v j day was announced and uh they said they would be a
