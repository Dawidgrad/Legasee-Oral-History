did you as boy sailors have a sense that there was real potential for a war during that training period we did actually because it was in nineteen thirty eight when neville chamberlain came back from munich with a bit of paper saying that there wouldn't be any wars the next thing we knew we were all out in the playground with pick axes and shovels digging air raid shelters on our playground we enjoyed that more rather than marching on it before you went on the ships did you get a well done or was going on the ships just part of the next stage i suppose it was a continuation the traineeship was hms anyway the routine was much the same so we got on the ship and we probably found being on the ship was easier as the routine wasn't as strict as the training we had a bit more freedom if you like although being boys we still had to conform to boys' routine we had a boys' mystic the boys were kept away from the older sailors we weren't allowed to mix with them only for work purposes what was it like seeing hms renown for the first time we thought it was a mighty big thing we saw it in the dockyard in portsmouth and we had been around the naval dockyard in portsmouth before that so we had seen a lot of big ships there were a lot of big ships coming in and out there were a lot of battle ships around then and we had seen the hood and that is the sister ship to renown really which was a bigger vessel so we had seen bigger ships we just haven't actually served on one or been on before until we got on there and started finding our way around tell me a bit about the boys' mess what was it like there were about twenty on each mess there was a scrub table which you would scrub every morning after breakfast and you went up to the galley taking it in turns two of you at a time to be cook of the mess you went up to the galley and it was on a big ship like renown which is what they called general messing all the food was provided for you you used to cook breakfast such as beans on toast or bacon and tomatoes that sort of thing and then dinner time at twelve o clock we went up to collect dinner which was usually a roast or a boiled dinner and then you had bread and butter for tea and then you had supper in the evening which could have been sausage and chips you know that sort of thing then it would be time for the boys to turn in by nine o clock then they called the hands at half six or seven in the morning and we all had to be up we all slept in hammocks you had to learn how to sling a hammock and sling it properly because the ship was moving if you hadn't slung it properly you would fall out of it i spent all my time in the navy sleeping in a hammock really i was only on one ship where they had bunks i got so used to the hammock i started to like it id rather a hammock then a bed i think even now yes it was very comfortable especially when you get adjusted to your own needs as it were the boys that you went onto renown with were they all pompeii ratings no before the war there was davenport man ships portsmouth man ships and chatham man ships your official number was either djx for davenport or pjx for portsmouth and cjx for chatham so all the boys that went onto renown they were all from different classes not necessarily all from my class and we happened to be graded to davenport so when we went on board renown the crew came up here from the barracks at davenport and they came up by train and joined the ship the same time as we did in portsmouth and it remained like that until after the war and the depots became amalgamated as it were so renown was a davenport man ship all throughout the war we didn't go davenport very often we only came here a couple times during five or six years
