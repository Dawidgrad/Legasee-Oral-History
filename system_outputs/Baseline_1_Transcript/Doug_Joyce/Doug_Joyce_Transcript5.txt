tell me about your operations in the denmark straits well it we patrolled up and down here now now when it it was so rough i mean our ship could do twenty eight knots we had a job to hold our bow into the storm at six knots if we you know just couldn't couldn't do anything about it and it flung us around i mean i want a little ship i mean tumble in and see them old ships so that they had no stabilizers not like to day ships got stable ordering not that but the sir we pretty done it for about a week or so and then another ship took over from us like in a and we went back to a alford in iceland that's what were your sea legs like how did you do you any good in the storms oh yes i was also you know and some nothing worry me on board ship and been climbing up ladders and things like that don't didn't worry me in the slightest you know and but one of the main jobs i had was right cause some is got clean a bridge so i took on the cleanest job on the bridge and all the bull generally at to be white and now and the turret where we only the turret where the control tower goes round i was in my store room well kept were cleaning gear you no but you be up there in the middle of the week perhaps we're being scapa flow light but i got this code kept clean up there just a sign me now elinor cayo could hear my the officers were talking about you know use wig you know it was going do you remember let's just talk a bit about big you seventeen do you remember listening in on these conversations eye we that day that that tom when it scattered i suppose i was sitting not like i am now on the starboard side my mate was on that on the starboard side with us and we could hear them join and we heard the radio bloke come out of the radio room and went up to admiral hamilton s got very urgent messer sir and he opened an oh my god gold he says and simons tied to the captain who was alongside him on the bridge light said was the matter sir he said we got the scope of the convoy said do what i said you got to so you got a bay is cause others we've been for court marshal no they said we not much we can do about it is we're going to break away one from the convoy now take the other cruisers with her the there was the two americans tuscaloosa and wichita there's the norfolk and us and there was four cruisers on it and then there was destroyers and yet the bloke in charge of the merchant sailor was commodore brown brown brown on his name was and he was in charge all the merchants like but i baldi thing the ship he was on he was a capel it's a but he sat losmall ships you know like mine layers and things like that is to escorting round now to we were you on deck when the rise you on the bridge when i was on the bridge atala and what was it do you remember what you know could you see what these other ships said as you turned instead of left me a nation you see that a ali was on the starboard side the tap was on the port hole was obit i couldn't see but if you were on the starboard side coming at my starboard i was from the bow to the stern and that's why we have two lookouts one covering from the bow to mid ships and the other one going from mid ships to stern so you'll cover the whole area like looking for periscopes and things like that it did seem odd to you to be turning away did it we did it seem odd to you at the time to be leaving the we felt so well we've got the ships here and if the turbans comes out it comes out and they about to have the rest of the fleet somewhere near us but we didn't realize that most of that fleet was back in ruin scapa flow and if it were even the aircraft carrier the planes couldn't take off on it cause the weather so rough could never take off on it oh am i don't know why he sent the cost in there could it's always rough up there always rough on it that no it's one place i don't want to go on a pleasure cruise or to die got no interest in norway now when did you leave when were you when did you finish your arctic convoys then am i shall reckon i never done another one after seventeen because we got nabbed to take geraldo band and all that lot out to alexandria cause they had the plate forces
