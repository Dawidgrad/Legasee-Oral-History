OR AN ORDINARY SLOOP WHICH WAS PROVED ON THE LAST DAY OF THE WAR OR THE CONVOY AND WE WERE ALL WAITING AROUND OUTSIDE TO GO THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN GAP INTO THE RUSSIAN END AND ER THAT A U BOAT WAS WAITING FOR US AND WE WERE ALL THERE AND THE CONVOY WAS COMING IN IT'S ON THE TELLY SOMETIMES CONVOY WAS COMING IN AND SPREADING ABOUT BUT THE GERMANS WERE WAITING UNDERNEATH THE CLIFF BOTTOMS AND YOU COULD ONLY GO INTO THE DOCKYARD THROUGH AN ENTRANCE NOT MUCH WIDER THAN THAT WITH TWO GREAT PILLARS OF COAST LINE SO YOU HAD A GOO ONE AT A TIME AND THE BIG LIBERTY SHIPS USED TO SQUEEZE THROUGH IT

MEAN IT AIN'T GOT A COMPASS LIKE WHERE YOU SEE THE ISL HANDS GOING O YOU GOT NUMBERS FLICKING BACKWARD AND FORWARD AND YOU HAD TO READ THEM AND ER BUT WE DID HAVE ONE OF THE OLD ONE WHAT ABOUT THIS SHIP THE JAPANESE SHIP HYOU WERE ESCORTING TELL ME ABOUT THAT YEAH WELL THAT WAS THE BIGGEST OF THEIR CRUISES I KENT TINKING DON'T ASK ME THE NAME I CAN'T TELL YOU BUT IT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE THEY HAD THAT THAD HAD AND SHE'D BEEN BOMBED AND SHE LAY IN THE HARBOUR WE USED TO GO BY HER EVERY TIME WE WENT IN AND OUT BUT WE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON THE BOTTOM BUT SHE WASN'T BUT ANYWAY IT WES THE BIGGEST ONE OF THE JAPANESE SHIPS AND IT HAD BEEN BOMBED AND ITA BEEN IN SINGAPORE HARBOUR FOR QUITE SOME TIME SINCE IT WAS IT AND BUT ANYWAY ONME NOWN THEY WERE MAKING IT READY TO TOW IT AND SINK IT YOU SEE AND WE GOT CHOSE TO DO IT AND WE WERE COMING ON OUR WAY HOME AS IT HAPPENED AND IT WE LEFT SINGAPORE WITH HER WITH A TUG WITH HER TWO TALK WITH HER ACTUALLY AND ER SHE WAS A MASSIVE SHIP AND SHE'D BEEN EMPTIED AND EVERYTHING AND I GOT DARK AND WEERE COMING UP THE MALAKA STRAITS AND WE GOT TO THIS POINT WHERE W SHE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN SUNK THE DEEPEST WATER BECAUSE SHE WAS THE BIGGEST WONEY HAD AT THE TIME AND ER CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS PITCH BLACK AND WEWERE ON OUR WAY COMING TO COME HOME YOU SEE IT COME TO MIDNIGHT AND ER WO TWO JAPANESE TOGS WERE TOWING HER THY HAD BEEN TOWING HER RD OUT ON AIR WELL IT WAS FAR AWAY FROM US FURTHER THAN THAT THEIR BIG HOUSE THER THEY WERE FROM US BUT THEY WERE COMING UP AGAIN THE COAST LINING AND WE WERE FURTHER OUT WHERE WE COULD KEEP OUR EYE ON EVERYTHING AND AS I SAY IT GOT PITCH BLACK AND BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE POINT WHIC WE HAD A COMPASS READING WE GOT A SINKER N THEY STARTED THE SHIP COMING UP AND LEFT HER THEY BOLTED AND LEFT THE SHIP WITH NO HEADWAY AND SHE' COME HALF WAY UP NEARLY TO WHERE SHE SUPPOSED TO HAE BEEN SUNK AND I EXPECT I DON'T KNOW WHAT EVER AIR CAPTAIN GOT PERMISSION TO SINK HER BUT IT WAS MIDNIGHT PITCH BLACK AND WE HAD OR SEARCH LIGHT ON HER AND THEY VANISHED INTO THE BLACK AND GONE COURSE SHE'S RIEDWELL SHE WOULDN'T DRIFT FURTHER BECAUSE I MEAN SHEW'S A MASSIVE SHIP BUT SHE WAS ONLY JUST OFF THE COAST LINE A WE THOUGHT PITCH BLACK AND I'M STILL ON THE BLOODY WHEEL I AM OF COURSE LOOKING OUT THE WHEERHOUS WELL CAUSE WE WEREN'T GOING WE WERE JUST ABOURING AND I SUPPOSE THE CAPTAIN GOT IN TOUCH WITH AIR PEOPLE AND THEY SAID WHAT TO DO SO WE HAD TO SEND MEN OVER WITH DEPTH CHARGES CAUSE WE CARRIED DEPTH CHARGES AND THEY GOT TO PUT THE DEPTH CHARGES AS LOW AS POSSIBLE IN THE SHIP BECAUSE THE WAS NOBODY ON THERE AND I MEAN IT WERE MASSIVE AND THEY'D GOT TO WIRE EVERYTHING UP AND ALL WE COULD DO WAS USE EIR DEPTH CHARGES AND ER AND TRY THEM THAT WAS ALL WE COULD DO WELL WE DID WE DID IT IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN WE STARTED AND WE WERE DRIFTING AS FUR AWAY PERAP A THIS FIRST OUSE FROM HER AND ER COURSE YOU COULDN'T DO MUCH REALLY BECAUSE HE AIR MOTORBOAT WENT OVER AND THEY TOOK I THINK THEY PUT FOUR DEPTH CHARGES IN HER IN THE MOTORBOAT AND ER THAT'S ALL SHE HOLD YOU SEE CARRY AND SO THEY TOOK THEM OVER FROM OFF OF US THEY WERE OUR CREW YOU SEEDOING IT AND WHATEVER THEY DONE THEY WENT ABOARD THE SHIP AND THEY TOOK THESE DEPTH CHARGES AS THE CAPTAIN HAD SAID ITAD GOT TO BE DONE AND PUT THEM RIGHT DOWN IN THE LOWER END A THEY COULD GET OF THE SHIP CAUSE I MEAN SHE WAS A BLOODY MASSIVE THING AND ERM THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD AND FOUSED EVERYTHING AWOUD EXPLODE AND CAME BACK TO US AND BANG SHE DID SHE WENT DOWN EYD BLEW THE BOTTOM OUT AND SHE WENT DOWN OF COURSE WE NEVER SEWE HER NO MORE BECAUSE WE LEFT HER THERE WHETHER SHE WASN'T TOO FAR OFF THE COAST AND SHE WASN'T TOO FUR FROM PINANG THESIP WASNT WE WERE GOING UP TOWARDS PINANG AND ER DID YOU SEE HE GOING DOWN THEN OH YEA WE WATCHED HER WITH THEIR SEARCH LIGHT YEAH ER E SPECIAL THING TO SEA YEAH WELL WE ONL TIL WE SE A MORE OR LESS AS BOI H THE MAST WES STICKING OUT ITINK THAT'S ALL BUT SHE' STILL GOING SHES STILL GOING DOWN AS SHE' PITCHED AR MEN PUT DEPTH CHARGES ALL THE WAY ALONG SO WHEN SHE GOT TO CERTAIN DEPTH THEY'D OPENED THE DEPTHS YOUKNOW THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP TO LET THE WATER IN AS YOU DO AND WE HAD TO SIT THERE UNTIL IT FILLED UP AND FILED THES CHARGES BLOODY YOU NEVER S LIKE IT IT WAS FABULOUS BUT OF COURSE WASN'T ALLOWED HEAD CAMERAS SO A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD MIND SWEEP YOU KNOW E STORY ABOUT WHAT YOU DO HOW YOU DO IT OH WELL THERE'S VARIOUS WAYS YOU CAN DO IT YOU CAN DO IT WITH EWIRES OUT WITH FLOATS ON WA L THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CN PUT DEPTHS DOWN PUT THEM DOWN TO CERTAIN DEPTHS AND LEAVE THEM DOWN THERE WAITING THEM DOWN IT DEPENDS WHAT'S GOING TO BE OVER THEM AND THATWHEN YOU COME BACK BUT BASICALLY YOU ONLY DO IT TO CLEAR THE OCEAN IN THE AREA YOU'RE IN AND IF THERE'S BEEN SHIPS COLLIDING WITH THEM WE GET SUNK WE'D GET SENT OUT THERE TO SWEEP IT YOU HAVE ANY NEAR MISSES WITH THE MINES WELL WE'VE HAD THEM COME UP BESIDE US YEAH I'D TIME O TO BUT WHEN YOU'RE ALL JOINED TOGETHER WITH GREAT STRONG BOYERS YOU'RE IN A FORMATION LIKE THAT AND EACH SIDE GOES OUT TO ANOTHER SHIP AND HEN THEY GO OUT TO ANOTHER ONE AND THEN OUT TO THE OTHER THEN YOU GOT SEVEN BUT YOU'RE THE ONE IN THE FRONT YOU'RETHEONE THAT'S GOT PROBABLY MORE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU CAN SOUND THAN THE OTHERS YOS THEY DO THAT SORT OF THING THEY KEEP IMPROVING ON CERTAIN THINGS AND WE MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S HOW YOU SWEEP THAT SWEEP YOU'R ALL OVERLATCH EACH OTHER AND YOUR ACTUALLY TIE YOU ATUALLY'E GOT WIRES HOLDING YOU TOGETHER IN A POSITION O NO NO IT'S ALL DONE FREE THEY RINK THEY HAVE TO SET THERE ONE EACH SIDE OF YOU AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE AND THEN VICE REVERSA FOR THE NEXT TO AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT THAT'S WHEN YOU DO THAT TYPE OF SWEEP BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS YOUYOU CAN SWEEP AND ER SOM WE USED TO DO SIPSWEEPS WITH E LONG WIRES WE HAD A GREAT BIG THING ON OUR QUARTER DECK AND IT WAS FULL OF HEAVY WIRE AND WE USED TO LET THAT OUT WITH THINGS ON THAT YOU KNOW AND ER CAPTAIN ON THE BRIDGEHE' SAY LET GO AND THEN YOU STOP IT WHEN I TELLS YOU COU IT WAS A MASSIVE SSTACK OF WIRE ON A DRUM AND IT'S NOT HEAVY WIRE BUT ER YOU PUT ANYTHING ON THE END OF IT YOU SEE AND YOU COULD LET IT OUT ANDIF IT WILL EXPLODE MINES OR OU'LL FIND IT IF THERE'S ANY THERE YOU'LL KNOW WHERE YOU STAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER IF Y IT'S TILLON UNLOCK REALLY AS YOU CAN'T LOOK DOWN IN THE SEA BUT WE USED TO SNAG UP ON WE SNAGGED UP ON AN AEROPLANE DOWN THERE THAT HAD CRASHED AND ER SO WE WERE TOLD IT I DON'T KNOW I NEVER SEEN IT BUT I KNOW WHEN IT SNAGGED IT AND IGOT ROUND THE SHIP BUT IT WAS A PLANE BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY KNEW BECAUSE WE DIDN'T STOP BUT YOU ALWAYS GOT SOMEBODY THAT MADE SOMETHING UP DIDN'T YOU YOU MENTIONE THIS ABOUT THIS CHAYOU KNOW THIS CHATHAM AND THE POMPDE RATING WHEN YOU SAY YOU MADE LIFE DIFFICULT WHAT DO YOU MEAN HOW DID YO DO THAT WARS WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WE COME HOME TO ENGLAND AND I HAD TA ON MOST OF THE TIME AN ER BECAUSE I USED TO GO UP AND SIT WITH THEM AND THEN I'D TECKE OVER BECAUSE I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM YOU SEE SO SO THEY DIDN'T ALL HAVE A ALONG THING I JUST TAKE IT YOU SEE AND HEL OUT AND ONE NIGHT A DOING THAT I HAD TO BE A QUARTER MASTER WHICH MEANS WHEN WE WERE AT ANCHOR I HAD TO DO A DUTY AT THE BACK OF THE SHIP WHERE WERE THEY COME IN AND OUT OF IT HEN E WES ASHORE AND ONE THING OR ANOTHER AND AL
