and what was it like when you were out on atlantic convoy and you could see this base boat sort of prowling around you well you could see them at stall during the day on the surface but nothing you could do about it and the the the escort see if you've got four com say you got four covets and you've got thirty merchant ships and then you've got twelve submarines armed following behind you what can you do you just wait that and that was that with great difficulty i mean the there's sometimes like the they they give the order to scatter you know this convoy to spit up and go each on your own way and we did that in one convoy because we were a faster ship some of the ships were only doing eight knots and that the the speed of the convoy was the speed of the lowest ship you see and you were sitting ducks in a way and so when i got very very bad in some way sometimes a commodore would say the only thing you soon spit up each go your own way we're going to lose some ships but we stayed together we might lose more so it was a matter of balancing that out you know and one of the arctic convoys that was a disaster when they did that did they give it you the the you mentioned about being sold to scatter was a lancet convoy year in atlantic count voles one of them as we have that was the then we went from there cause we were one of the we want a very fast shipping one of the faster ships what about camaraderie and just talk a bit about what it was like you know me were you always with the same apprentices that you started with ears are always different on every ship sometimes you might be with the same people on the next ship not necessarily i mean that we i think i was with one particular captain about two or three trips but now it was changed because when he went home on leave and they'd reallocate people to different ships you know and so but but there was a very good friendship amongst the crew that was really good you know and the the solidarity and people were willing to stick together and do what they could you know and so that was very positive actually there's there a man in birmingham who is on the same ship with me he was a cook and now i did know that he was on this until he saw me under songs of praise and he picked that up and he got him as he rang me up and i didn't remember his name cause it was only been on the ship for a few weeks before we were sunk and i didn't know everybody and a but now he's in party regular contact with me and he's retired is a bit older than me where's he live birmingham i would in interview him i'll give you his name and address when we finished her were you ever you ever saw pilot again no some people were torpedo several times i mean some people we picked up a been on the nose tanker and they saw the torpedo they were on the gun gun platform which is at the stern because it was defensive and they saw the torpedo was coming and in a petrol tanker they knew what was happening so they jumped in the water straight away and the ship went on to peters hit it it blew up boats were lowered the sea was on fire the boats everybody in the boats was burnt they were the only two that were saved and then they'd also been tapped on another ship so some people had two or three sinkings with a really unusual cargoes carried and when we carried off mixed cargoes and even in a going down to italy for intent in addition to german tanks we had food supplies we had a railway lines because the railways have been devastated in in italy and they had to lay new tracks you see now remember those vividly because one things slipped out of the sling when we are unloading them and when and one of the cadets i was the third mate the one of the cadets was down in the hole and i hit him on the foot and his foot was bleeding we had to carry him off to shore i remember that quite vividly and you carried a very general cargo transport and ammunition and a you know war supplies and only do whatever was needed and then this was allocated by the minister transport some ships would have this some ships should have the other you know and i was quite amazed in new york when we loaded these set sherman tanks because they put general cargo down below first and then they came in and made a sort of dance floor beautiful wood right throughout over over the other cargo we wonder what was going on cause we're told by the dockers there then they loaded these tanks and then they pulled them sideways on this floor because they put grease down and then they they pulled them sideways with the wind to see so he could pack more in was very very clever of them who was in charge of the loading of the ship you know who has that job well that was done in port normally by the steve doors but in some form ports it was done under supervision of the ship itself we had to use our own derricks and things and cranes especially in west africa where we used to go quite a lot because you they went to facilities there in them we were going up some of the creeks in west africa ninety miles inland up to sapily and then you'd you'd tie up to a big tree i mean incredible
