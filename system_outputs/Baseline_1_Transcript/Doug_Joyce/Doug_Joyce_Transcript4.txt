fact what about in russia did you ever get ashore i i had to go ashore to pick up the mail once a because it was flown out in a where were we as a merman then because the germans om tell a omansk eventually they they used to take the man there but then they took it down to arc angers further down the arctic ocean lit and am i went ashore light and i saw these women on a dockyard lamp and they're all sacking all round their legs some of their little kids with them and i thought or poor voters and i didn't complain where they would have done any good anyhow so next time i'll sit in the chap in the male office on board i said can i go ashore the next time pick up the male i'll tell you what i want to do use i want take some chocolate for the children will in enough he can't even brought me bars of chocolate it says so as the women are working on a dock line i said him for him not you him da da she says you know it's her and then they only give me a looming bottles of this and bottle of boots and that and if i lundy fire was the mono dare to take them back on board ship but they got on pretty well with them you know what was what was what was the harbor like described in a well it's been well bum by the time we got up there casino the germans were any got their airport and it was called a bank bananas along on the norwegian coast and they could fly there and back within half hour drop their bombs back again light this was this is why with the cold war you see they they could drop their bombs and told peters and wherever they got but go back to the nor wagon and re load up again be back within an hour that's well you know i said that day that on july the fourth at twenty five come of us cause it's perpetual daylight and they could see all their targets what they wanted that some poor merchant didn't stand a chance really and what was it like did you see some of these merchant ships going down oh yeah yeah they're just uno they hit em with two two torpedoes and one say the light that gone in the us to see the bow go right up like that and just go straight down and you know them seamen unless they were rescued within five minutes the most the arctic weather will get them you not it was was the london firing on these plans were we if we were close enough we if there at a range there's not much you could do i mean there was a when we was on the convoy there was a german blonvoss going round and round the convoy and he's tapping out information to submarines to aircraft places all the time and that's what us how they keep track of us all the time and my skipper got so fed up one day because this blum boss going round the c right all eight and ten miles away from us to you now and he loaded the on the a gun deck he loaded it with two shells two aging shells and he fired i had it fired at it is got on his nerves lightly so i got to do something likely be count we didn't hit him but the way airing they were you know but they could spot us all the time and they were sending the information to to the german depots and places like that what was youkilis as very good he was very good a or know when we was taking stamp through on the med on the med run a test what they call the lamp a dose straights here and he started coming along and he could hear the italian plains up above and they're very good gun sights you know bombsights and where the weight was he turned round and went down his own wake and the bombs were all this end dropping cause that's where the yetis could see the weight like you know he was very alert he was one of the best skippers i've been on on that ship there was we've had two a thing altogether like but the simons tailor was his name but the whole crew were good you know how many crew waters must been nearly a thousand because with all the extra guns you've got the extra extra men don't you says that was it a happy ship oh yes i do know if all ships were like that it must be a good
