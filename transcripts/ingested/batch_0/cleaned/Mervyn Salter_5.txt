can you remember these days can you remember what was happening and how you felt and what you knew as i say because we were close up all the time on and off we had before we went fully in action stations it was a case of coping with the weather and the sea conditions because we knew we were after a big ship not knowing initially which one but then it came through that it was the scharnhorst and as i say she was massive did you see it saw it illuminated by star shell yes for you know fleeting glimpses before we actually went in to fire out shells our torpedoes i should say and do you recall being hit yes you could hear that there was a a bang obviously a bang and the bit of a shudder butchered on our starboard side i was on the port side so not didn't get the full effect of it but enough to know that we had been struck yes and after you'd been hit are you still in your action station does it change then you don't move of to help the bridge or anything no no no we still had to close up as i say because of the a situation could arises where the close range weapon was required it wasn't on that occasion but it could have been so yeah we still stayed closed up until the next day when we fell out and then we had to bury our dead at sea i was going to ask you about that can you tell me about that and what happens and what the morale on the ship is like what's the where were you what's the effect well as i say they trying to think of their names anyway they were sewn up in bags and weighted of course and put over the side and we had a short service prayer service and then it was a question of getting back to your duties again you know how did that effect the morale of the ship it's a case of you just have to get on with these things you know it wasn't until we pulled into the kola inlet that we found out who had been killed one that was close to me was a ken was a leading seaman and part of my ship and a first class sailor you know we had twins aboard and one of those had been killed so they had to transfer the other one pretty quickly and get him back to england and as i say we stayed there for a week so we transferred him to another ship but it was a case of as i say you just have to get on with your job and that was it so didn't really upset the moral at all just that a couple that you knew would no longer be with you you know then we came back and we went to newcastle for full repair going up the tyne there were hundreds of people on the bank waving flags and cheering and all the ships and boats all the way up to be sounding of their sirens in recognition of our effort to against the scharnhorst it was something that really lives with you forever struck my heart you know it really was something
