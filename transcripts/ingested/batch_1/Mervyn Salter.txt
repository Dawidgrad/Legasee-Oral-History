i'm mervyn john salter i was an able seaman anti aircraft gunner i joined the royal navy in nineteen forty two at the age of eighteen and trained at hms raleigh and hms drake mervyn why did you why did you want to join the navy over any other service it was just a preference of the sea and the sea and what it offered or at least what i thought it offered where are you from where were you living sort of early part of the war i was in bath yes yes i was living in bath at the time tell me a bit about that that process that you go through and where you you know the early stages of your training well as i say i joined at hms raleigh and we did the usual things that drilling ect boat working with whalers and that type of thing until then i switched to hms drake and i took up the anti aircraft gunnery as i say are there any are there any memories any stories that you can remember from drake or raleigh well there were we were at st and it was just a normal a normal training session you know there was nothing outstanding at that time we spent one weekend on the great water fort and most of that time we were peeling potatoes but you know that's that's about it as far as i know that's alright when did you get your draft and what tell me about how you felt about where you went and when you saw the ship ye as i said after training i was drafted to hms saumarez an s class destroyer which was commissioning at ebon in tyne and as i say i joined her there what do what do you remember of seeing her for the first time can you remember that day well you know she was a sleek low lying destroyer what is said tell me a bit about saumarez what your mess was like you knowwhat life was like on board for you know a young sailor well as i say it was an optimistic you went down stairs there were lockers which we sat on mostly when we were on the arctic conveys because we er couldn't sling hammocks we had hammock storage down below there were two messes two or three messes about ten fifteen in a mess we used to have to prepare our meals and this was taken up to the galley where they were cooked and they had a cook of the mess and you know your turn came around probably every four or five days and as i say we just off watch you sat and chatted and looked at anything that was available you know that type of thing why didn't you why didn't you sling your hook your hammock hammock sorry why didn't you sling your hammock in the arctic er because the sea and that was not convenient you know too much swinging and because we too often having to prepare to go on watch on at action stations so as i say a lot of the time we didn't undress properly we just waiting there all the time too to go on watch or go ongo to actions stations what was some of the can you remember the sort of the first few journeys of what you did i mean did you go to norway quite early on the first trip i took saumarez was detailed to carry out an sweep whilst accompanying rms queen mary with churchill aboard on route to a meeting with roosevelt in quebec or at quebec but due to a typical atlantic storm gale force winds and mountainous seas we had to call it off after seventeen hours because it was because the conditions were so bad and resulted that we limped into st johns newfoundland four days after queen mary birthed at quebec so some baptism at my first trip to sea how were your sea legs i was never sea sick that was one thing i always boasted about i was never sea sick can you describe conditions in those seas well as i say it was very mountainous seas and the ship would be either up and down mainly going into the water and the water would cascade over the top of the bridge and all the down over the guns and all the rest of it what was your action station then you know at the time were you on or off that watch i was as i say on an oerlikon gun which was on a platform posted just after the after the funnel where you on an oerlikon in these storm oh yes yes really where you thinking i wish i'd gone to the air force at this point never never what was next well as i say led me kip out from canada we were attached with units in the fleet to carry out bombardments of installations on the norwegian coast which was our first my first taste of the war as it were and on retiring from the action we were pursued by enemy aircraft but fortunately they didn't press on too much so we escaped unscathed as it were is that the first time you got to fire the oerlikon i didn't actually fire because the four sevens the bigger guns kept the aircraft at bay you know but we were close up ready to fire but my range was only a thousand yards you see so that as i say though i was close up i didn't actually have to fire at that time what was it like to be you know although you'd done gunnery training can you remember what felt like to be on board when the ship really opened up in terms of the full bombardment what's the effect on the ship like it's obviously a lot of noise from the four sevens really it was a great deal because it was steaming and we were probably doing twenty twenty plus knots so that you got the judder from the ships firing the big guns firing but as we were closed up we concentrated on our own efforts we didn't take too much notice of this yes so we came after the norwegian trip then it was arctic convoys this was different as churchill described the worst journey in the world and it was horrific on occasions the ship could get bitterly cold conditions covered with ice over the guns and deck all of the rest of it which meant you had to chip it all of otherwise you were vulnerable and if it was not the icey conditions it was still bitterly cold but you run into gale force winds and mountainous seas the sort that would take you to the crest of the wave twenty thirty feet in the air and then drop you down into the troth and as you were going down the judder and shuddering and the whole ship would be shaking and then you'd become complete awash with the wave and you wouldn't whether or not you would stay afloat did you ever and sometimes the conditions were so bad that we could go off watch and go back to our deck and find it awash with three or four inches of water plates having sprung from some of its rivets and there was only one way to get rid of it and that was to put the water in the buckets and then hand it in a chain and pass it up through the ladder through the hatchway and throw it over the side very very and very helpful when you've just come off watch and all you want to do is sleep if you could you know i mean the conditions the weather conditions are one thing obviously another big problem with arctic was you either had u boats on you or you were obviously under air attack do you remember any of that very much yes indeed we certainly the u boats oft times we'd get what you call a ping on the asdic and then you start pursuing them oft times dropping depth charges but in our experience we never actually encountered one on the surface we seemed to do this when they were unwater whether or not we scored any successes it was hard to know because sometimes there was oil but whether they were just releasing it what was the role of the saumarez you know what its duty on the international convoy was just talk about its strategy and its positioning etc well we because of the we could get up to thirty two knots and therefore we were oft times covering the perimeter guarding the other cruisers aircraft carriers or battleships if they were so we were more or less scouting as it were and viewing the horizon to make sure a lot of my job was on lookouts you know making sure there was no enemy aircraft or enemy shipping or u boats or for that matter any aircraft so this was our role really did you did you get ashore in polanyi or murmansk certainly in polyarny yeah what is said can you remember what it was like yeah a bit desolate we did manage to play football on some icy pitch there but there wasn't really much to recall the only people that would be likely to speak to you would be young children and some of them could speak english some english but they seemed to train to ask about the radar to find out what they could about the radar but of course we were warned about this really wow i've never heard that mhm yes because they didn't have it apparently so tell me we just touched on that but we didn't discuss actually just tell me a bit about your job on the oerlikon and the setup and what you were trying to do and how it operated well as i say we had this oerlikon we were responsible for the maintenance of it so it's a case of having to strip it down and make sure it worked properly then if called upon remembering the range was about a thousand yards but it was only times that you came into close contact with anything that you were required obviously you were expected to fight off any aircraft that came within that range when they came sweeping in but also if you closed on any shipping or land installations where you were required to open fire that would be part of the job was it an enjoyable job i enjoyed it yes i did i did yes indeed did you ever shoot any aircraft not actually no mainly funnily enough as far as the aircrafts concerned because of the way we were operating the bigger guns were more or less keeping them out of range so that i did get charged on one occasion why didn't i open fire my answer was that i couldn't afford to waste ammunition and this was accepted you see if the things five thousand yards away or something of that sort your shells would be falling short way before effective range you know one of the convoys that you did was quite well known j w fifty four b and er this one in company with the duke of york jamaica the destroyers savage scorpion and the norwegian stord we left iceland late on christmas eve and sailed all day christmas day and boxing day and again pretty erratic seas and then caught up with the german battlecruiser scharnhorst about th in the afternoon boxing day and then all the big ships duke of york and jamaica opened fire but the scharnhorst although hit several times still managed to get away and was her speed was too fast for these other ships so four destroyers were detailed to give chase together with savage on the north side and the scorpion and stord on the south side we approached to torpedo range and we fired our torpedo and in heeling over to fire our torpedo we were hit we were struck by an eleven inch shell in the director and range finder and though it didn't explode it still killed one officer and ten ratings and seriously wounded ten ratings another shell put the starboard engine out of action so we had to retire from the fight as it were and then in company with scorpion we sailed into a kola inlet where we stayed for a week and carried out temporary repairs can you remember these days can you remember what was happening and how you felt and what you knew as i say because we were close up all the time on and off we had before we went fully in action stations it was a case of coping with the weather and the sea conditions because we knew we were after a big ship not knowing initially which one but then it came through that it was the scharnhorst and as i say she was massive did you see it saw it illuminated by star shell yes for you know fleeting glimpses before we actually went in to fire out shells our torpedoes i should say and do you recall being hit yes you could hear that there was a a bang obviously a bang and the bit of a shudder butchered on our starboard side i was on the port side so not didn't get the full effect of it but enough to know that we had been struck yes and after you'd been hit are you still in your action station does it change then you don't move of to help the bridge or anything no no no we still had to close up as i say because of the a situation could arises where the close range weapon was required it wasn't on that occasion but it could have been so yeah we still stayed closed up until the next day when we fell out and then we had to bury our dead at sea what is said i was going to ask you about that can you tell me about that and what happens and what the morale on the ship is like what's thewhere were you what's the effect well as i say they trying to think of their names anyway they were sewn up in bags and weighted of course and put over the side and we had a short service prayer service and then it was a question of getting back to your duties again you know how did that effect the morale of the ship it's a case of you just have to get on with these things you know it wasn't until we pulled into the kola inlet that we found out who had been killed one that was close to me was a ken was a leading seaman and part of my ship and a first class sailor you know we had twins aboard and one of those had been killed so they had to transfer the other one pretty quickly and get him back to england and as i say we stayed there for a week so we transferred him to another ship but it was a case of as i say you just have to get on with your job and that was it so didn't really upset the moral at all just that a couple that you knew would no longer be with you you know then we came back and we went to newcastle for fullrepair going up the tyne there were hundreds of people on the bank waving flags and cheering and all the ships and boats all the way up to be sounding of their sirens in recognition of our effort to against the scharnhorst it was something that really lives with you forever struck my heart you know it really was something forty four presented some differently challenges where you at normandy yes yes indeed after being repaired at newcastle we did another russian convoy and then we were detailed to normandy for d day we joined in the bombardment the dawn bombardment which again something that is hard describe the noise and the effect all the ships firing their guns it really was something you know we remained there for about two months patrolling juno sword beaches in the channel again protecting the landing craft and the building mulberry harbour one or two minor incidents and this took us up until september i think it was what were the minor incidents can you remember couple of german vessels were entering the channel going to jersey and we exchanged shots with them but they got away we might well of hit one or two but as i say nothing really serious did you go out to ouistreham as well yes yes indeed what is said did you think there was did you see feel that there was a different experience to normandy does it scale or well arromanchewas a the beach a fantastic beach it really was it was different a holiday type of effect you know ok so in september then is that when you were then moved to the pacific no we then went back and did another two russian convoys and this then took us up to the end of nineteen forty four anything exciting on those convoys one of them there was a lot of air activity i forget which one one of them was a very fast patrol we escorted a ship it was taking whether it was prisoners of war i'm too sure about that but anyway it was a fast run for us did you have any feeling about the fact that you'd seen normandy and then you had to do more russian convoys does it did you sap your moral or did you just accept it again it was all part of your duties you just had to get on with it cause' as i say the end of nineteen forty four the next thing was that we were appointed captain d of the this was in january nineteen forty five appointed captain d of the twenty sixth destroyer flotilla and what did that mean to you and what did that mean to the ship in general well we had a captain on board who was intent on becoming an admiral and did and did become an admiral later on and as captain d of these ships the venus virago vigilant volage so that we we were sort of in charge we set an example i suppose and with the captain aboard he was making sure that this was so doing exercises all of the time to make sure that we were efficient as i say did you enjoy it was it enjoyable having somebody that sort ofgetting you active and up and about i wouldn't say enjoy but we it's certainly you know put on your metal and you know this was not a bad thing that we sailed through the mediterranean we oiled at malta alexandria through the suez canal stopping at port aden and then finally birthed at trincomalee which had become our main base for attacking the japanese that must have been a welcome respite after the arctic certainly warm yes indeed yes indeed it was different but then it was a completely different setup as you say all together we got involved in a few skirmishes in the andaman sea's couple of those one of them a japanese ship was sunk and we picked up five women survivors five japanese and about fifty to fifty plus chose to swim away trust their lives with the sharks rather than be picked up and they were so fanatic that on another occasion we sank a submarine chaser and that ship was going down stern first the master was climbing the mast with an automatic gun firing aimlessly into the sky and of course he just went down with the ship these were the sorts of things you had with the japanese you just couldn't tell what was going to happen next can you just describe the rescue process for somebody who doesn't know how it operates because it's unusual in the arctic you wouldn't really do it would you no no no so what was the process well you just had a scrambling net over the side and they had to climb a scrambling net and when they got up you'd lift them over the top what was it like to suddenly see japanese women climbing over these nets well they were not japanese actually indonesian one was an indian but they were more of the islands rather than japanese they were obviously for the comfort of the japanese so they were basically slaves sex slaves absolutely yes and what do you do with prisoners of war i mean what happens next the ladies of course we put them to good use because we had several days before we got back into port and er they did all our dobeying for us which was very helpful i wondered what you were going to say then yes the japanese of course we had a constant guard over them all the time but the five that we had just accepted that they were prisoners and that was it on one of the other boats one of the japanese actually committed suicide we learned again as i say you just couldn't say what was going to happen next the next thing that we er how do i describe this for you we didn't come off best explaining again our captain was intent on becoming an admiral and therefore he was looking all the time seeking things so we pulled into stewart sound in the nicobar islands and we were accompanied by rapid hms rapid and hms volage we left rapid at the mouth of the sound volage came halfway and saumarez went all the way up a winding stream as it were until we came to this island we were looking for shipping there was none there instead there was a six inch gun on this island when we came to it we were passing it we could see the japanese being awaked from their siesta running to man their gun but they couldn't get a range on us so we we were lucky in that way otherwise we would have been blown out of it all together how far away were you fifty hundred yards it was that close as you say it was like a winding river i suppose type of thing you know obviously anyway we received a message that the rapid had been hit so we turned back and retreated back down the the sound and took the rapid in tow a sight that was rather frightening she'd been hit the er her lookin' crew were like wax dolls at their gun obviously killed by the blast there was only one survivor on the deck ex gun had a direct hit and there were limbs legs and arms on the deck as i say it was all all scary to look at you know i think they lost thirty six in all and we took her in tow volage meantime was also pulled back from halfway and was making smoke to protect us and we pulled out into the main andaman sea and rapid was unable to make her own way under her own steam and we accompanied her to in burma where obviously you transfer all the wounded and the dead to hospitals and what have you there again we didn't have time to think about these things next thing we were sailing again and this was now to rangoon capital of burma which we were retaking we were only there for four or five days because the troops ashore had made so much progress there was not much for the navy to do so we pulled back and returned to trincomalee back in trincomalee and then we joined the main fleet queen elizabeth rodney one or two others big ships we learned that the japanese were probably evacuating from the nicobar islands and in fact it turned out to be a japanese cruiser haguro and an accompanying destroyer again we sailed all day and just before midnight we made contact and then went into action we again fired our torpedoes and quite successfully scored a couple of hits but in turn got hit ourselves and had to withdraw from the battle as it were leaving the other ships venus fargo vigilant perhaps to actually finish of the haguro and she was sank we returned to trincomalee and from there we went to south africa for repair in durban we had a couple months down there which was fantastic away from the war as it were and one experience i had was that i stayed for two three weeks with a superintendent and his staff on a colony in which was as i say a complete change from what had been going on really enjoyable we returned and on our way back to trincomalee again to join the fleet we passed madagascar and the news was broken of the bomb at hiroshima and nagasaki which was first nagasaki i can't remember but anyway i think nagasaki was first we arrived back in trincomalee spent a week or so there before again joining the fleet in the indian ocean then asked captain d senior captain d to lead the fleet into singapore to retake singapore which again was a sight to behold leading the whole leading the fleet into the harbour was really how many ships can you remember na i can't quite a few but did you like this chap this skipper we didn't get to know him too well because he was very detached the only thing to say in all honesty was that he was a good skipper he got us through these things that other men may not have done and as i say he maintained a very efficient ship so much so that on our return to the uk the war over and hes still carrying out night exercises torpedo attacks that sort of thing you know dummy ones to keep us on our toes what was his name manley power admiral manley power he finished his admiral of the dockyard at portsmouth and he lived on the isle of white i think just conclude by saying that sadly my ship was recommissioned in nineteen forty six and was mined in the corfu channel in october well after the end of the last war and subsequently had to be broken up being of no further use for service that was mines laid by the albanians whether you remember that incident but that was the end of the saumarez what is said you weren't on board though were you no i'd left that was in october i left her in february before that did you feel for her when she went yes it was a happy ship absolutely yes indeed we maintained contact several reunions over the years but again as one would expect there are fewer and fewer of us left so no more reunions and how do you reflect on the war now something that must not be forgotten particularly from the angle of the japanese who were carried out some as you probably some horrific actions the germans were more disciplined and good seamen but er i think that they these things must never be forgotten i'd just hate to think what might happen if anything major turned up in the future
