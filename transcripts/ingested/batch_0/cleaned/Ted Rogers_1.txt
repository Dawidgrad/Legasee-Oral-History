hello my name is edward rogers but i'm normally called ted' for short where are you from i was born in liverpool nineteen twenty four a long time ago now so in nineteen thirty nine you were fifteen years of age do you remember the liverpool blitz yes i was living in twenty eight sturdy road near broad green it wasn't quite broad green but it wasn't far away what do you remember of the liverpool blitz were you evacuated oh the blitz i went to sea the blitz was in nineteen forty we had an anderson shelter in the garden and we all sort of scrambled into that because we were a big family we had a double one and my father arranged a big sort of wooden stage at one end of it and that was used as a bed and so we had quite a bit of it my uncle was bombed out he lived about a mile away from where we were that was in nineteen forty the next year i went to sea well in nineteen forty one actually but why did you want to go to sea rather than any other service well first of all i joined the home guard when i was fifteen i have pictures of that in my uniform my father joined the home guard and he'd been in the first world war and he was a corporal then before he was wounded and so he was a corporal in the home guard and i thought i'd join him you see to help defend the country and so that's what i did and then my father evacuated my mother and the younger children to northern ireland to get away from the bombing and so there was only my sister and my father left and i decided well i'm going to be called up in any case shortly and so i decided to become a merchant seaman because we had sort of a lot of relatives or former relatives at sea and my father worked for a shipping company so we had long sort of connections so i thought if i go to sea i'll also get a training for after the war you see i'd be a merchant navy officer which i was when i left but why the merchant navy over the navy then well i couldn't join the navy at sixteen you have to be eighteen and joining the navy did not necessarily mean you'd have a professional job after the war whereas the merchant navy i went as a midshipman or cadet and so i served an apprenticeship for three years then i graduated as a third officer so i could have stayed on and got my masters eventually and stayed on as a master or captain of a merchant ship you see so you already had quite an ambition from a very young age well i decided to see what could be done and of course during the war is was very difficult to make any decisions because people were being were being called up you didn't know what was going to happen you didn't know whether you were going to stay alive and what was going to go on you know and so what was the process then for joining the merchant navy what did you have to do before you were given your first ship well you had to have your o' levels first and fortunately i went to a secondary school because i got a scholarship and in those days there were very few secondary schools people left after primary school at the age of fourteen so i got my o levels i could have stayed on to do a levels but then what would happen and anyway i was glad to get out of the school because i didn't like it and what to do during the war so my sister started working at a munitions place she was older than me meccano they used to make little trains and big toys during the war they switched to munitions and things like that you know and my father was also in a shipping company and that's the one i joined it was easier in that sense what did you actually do would you literally join up and then you were on a ship or was there a process no you went straight on a ship and cleaned out the bilges on the first day you see a great thing about in those days the merchant navy was an apprenticeship you did any job that a seaman would do even though you were being trained as an officer and so the first morning i was on a ship we were woken by the boatswain at six o'clock no half past five in the morning 'come on lads we have to go down to the bilges and clean the bilges out' that was the training for an officer then you'd spend your time cleaning the decks painting watch keeping and so on and lookouts and up the mast and all this kind of thing for three years it was four years before the war but they cut a year off because of wanting to get more officers through you see and so at the end of that in other words it was on the job training it was an apprenticeship it wasn't just an academic programme and so the seaman knew afterwards that if you told him to do something that you had done it yourself so there was no problem about you don't know what's going on here' that was the tradition i think it was a very good tradition actually and then also i got my second mate's certificate you needed that to be a third mate you see or third officer and then you had to spend another eighteen months watch keeping actually in charge of a watch before you could take the next the mate's certificate another eighteen months before you could take the master's so it was all graded out and when i was in education in zimbabwe i used this for training social workers they have steps and do a lot of practical work as well so it was a useful experience for me
