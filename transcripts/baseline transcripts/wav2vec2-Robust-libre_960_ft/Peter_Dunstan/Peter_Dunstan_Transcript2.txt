you were down in dead obviously that you know were you seeing a lot of the battle of britain no we didn't see a thing i mean that was a i don't even know when the battle of britain was but a wine we didn't see much of that at all the only thing i do remember was that there was a a german a seaplane with red cross markings and i know that there was a a a submarine in the in the channel and it fired at a ship in just off deal with two torpedoes and the torpedoes miss the ship hit the beach and jumped up onto the beach and we were taken down there am on guard in case anybody got near them but other than that saw very little achouldn't air until a until we got to plymouth okay so you've got to plymouth do you know you're going to be on the prince of wales at this point and what was it like when you suddenly saw that ship for the first time you knew that was what we're going to be a no not until you had finished training and they were detailing off a hundred and eighty raw marines to be the detachment of the battleship prince of wales and it was then that about twenty five of our squad were all a detailed off to be part of the hundred and eighty detachment of the raw marines a for the prince of wales that was okay we all organized train from a devonport with all our kit on was a straight through to liverpool and a at liverpool yes liverpool cause it was at liverpool cause it the principal as was a built in a camel ads in a birkenhead and when we got to the docks had the doc place in a birkenhead a it was snowing then i'm sorry if i said earlier that i that it was a summer it wasn't it was that it was snowing it was snowing like a sun o and we marched from birkenhead railway station to camels dockyard and we formed up on the on the a key and we could see this ship lying over slightly on onto the key side and through the snow it and he looked like a a cruiser or a destroyer and to our amazement the sergeant major came down and detailed us off and we we were marched aboard to our respective ermesteks and the reason the or prince of wales was lying over at a slight angle was that the jet of the germans had been bobbing and they dropped a bomb between the prince of wales and the dockside which was ten feet the bomb missed the prince of wales went down into the water and exploded and blew a loose one of the plates near the boiler room in the prince wales which flooded her and she was laying over on over at an angle that was the first thing of the hoodoo that the prince wales was i was going to say when you saw that and you found that out i mean you know it must have been exciting going on to the ship for the first time but did you have a sense that there was a hoodie no no no it's just one of those things while it's war and it happened we were darn lucky that it didn't hit the ship itself and the bomb it hit the ship itself and a make a big mess but it meant enough mess as it was a had you been on a ship at this point no no sir tell me what was it like leaving liverpool bill birkin had done i was detailed off to a b at this time i wasn't qualified in anything except as a rat's a plain row marine am but i was detailed of in the navy or any ships passing another ship a merchant shipper that you lower the white ensign and the ship lowers there a ensign in recognition if the ship didn't lower ensign then you went for ra and i was i was in the aft allowing the engine cold in freezing job but it one of those things until we got to a got to a scap we got to scapper and we were sent into the a a dock in scapper and repaired and then of course it was training a part of the training a churchill i wanted to go to america to meet the roosevelt and the prince of ours was destined for it and we took churchill across to america to meet rosabel what was the you know when when you're on a ship over see now there's a completely new set of training can you talk a bit about some of the you now intensive training that you'd have been going through as she was you know almost shakedown trials and it so happens that a being a brand new ship they were short of a gunnery and artifices and machinists and things like that and they went through the crew records and course my record showed that i'd been in the machine shops and in industry a prior to joining the role marines and so i was a detailed to go down to the machine shop we had a beautiful machine shop down on the price wales and i met the chief petty officer and i still sit now he questioned me then he gave me a piece of machine and said her boy make that and i i'd hardly got the the metal into the into the late and he said you know what you're doing your duty is here so when the room rings where a m on parade i was excused duties because i was in the machine shop the chief petty officer of the machine shop said that we were at war the ship had to be brought up to full fighting standard and therefore i was to be remain in the machine shop while the rest of the row marines from on parade is that a good singer about things now it's a good thing because i mean i meant to say that i'll past three of an afternoon four o'clock was evening quarters i'll past three you had to go up and re redress polish a uniform polish everything to be on parade at four o'clock for the captain marine's inspection and as i was as i say down in the there were four of us there were three working in the in the gun turret and i was in the machine shop and we were excused to duties so we used we used to carry on there how was it being below deck when you were first night sailing cease it and i was seasick for the first day and then after that i and my body seemed to accumulate acclimatise and so i wasn't sea sick after that i mean a going across the atlantic to america i mean we had a pretty rough time but i seemed to settle down and i was all right i mean there were other poor devils being soberly seasick and i was walking around quite good okay so after the sea trials and you went up to scalper is that right yes what what were you doing up there more what was the experience of being up there like commonly known in the royal navy as swinging round the boy we just angered in scape and just doing normal training you know aboard ship while we were anchored until such time as we were ordered and to accompany the hood the bismark was out and we were we were ordered with the with the hood the battleship hood to chaser and fighter and that was when the hood a got a shell in the magazine from the bismark and blew up and sunk and we got a fourteen inch shell from the bismark which landed a i can't remember how it was very close to our our real magazine if that had exploded it happened to be a dud but if he had us exploded the prince of wales would have blown up as well but that was the number two of the hood of the prince of wales
