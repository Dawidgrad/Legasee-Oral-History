MY NAME IS IRENE BELLAMY I RANG JUST WHERE ARE YOU FROM I WAS FROM BRISTOL FROM THE FISH BONDS AREA WHERE I WAS BORN AND I WENT TO SCHOOL IN BRISTOL AND STARTED MY WORK AFTER SCHOOL IN BRISTOL HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN WAR BROKE OUT WELL I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN NINETEEN SO I WAS TWENTY WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE ARE YOU IN BRISTOL I KNEW WHAT HAPPENED JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT YOUR SCHOOLING AND JUST LIFE IN BRISTOL SO I UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE YEAH I ORIGINALLY WENT TO A SMALL PRIVATE SCHOOL AND THEN WENT TO COLSTON FROM THERE AND ERM BRISTOL ITSELF I FOUND RATHER DULL YOU KNOW IT WAS ALL PUBS AND CHURCHES THAT'S HOW IT SEEMED TO ME YOU KNOW THERE WEREN'T THE FUN THINGS THAT THERE ARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY ERM SPENT MOST OF OUR TIME EITHER GOING TO THE OUR FREE TIME GOING TO THE CINEMA OR PLAYING SOME KIND OF GAMES YOU KNOW I BELONGED TO YOU KNOW VARIOUS HOCKEY TEAMS AND TENNIS CLUBS ERM AND ERM DURING THE WAR OF COURSE WE WORKED VERY LONG HOURS ERM AT EIGHT SO THAT YOU WEREN'T LOOKING FOR MUCH LEISURE FUN AND I MOVED BECAUSE OF THE BRISTOL BITS DURING THAT TIME I WAS PUT BY THE FIRM THEY DIDN'T WANT US IN THE DANGER OF CENTRAL BRISTOL AND SO ON AND SO THEY TOOK OVER A COTTAGE IN SHIPS IN OLDBURY AND I LIVED IN SHIPS IN SUDBURY FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THAT WAS QUITE GOOD FUN ACTUALLY THE SORT OF VILLAGE LIFE LOTS GOING ON BUT I'D ALWAYS HAD A END TO GO INTO THE NAVY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT MAINLY BECAUSE I HAD FRIENDS WHO HAD JOINED THE SERVICES ERM AS IT WAS IT WRENS OVER ANY OTHER SERVICE YEAH I DIDN'T WANT TO JOIN DO YOU MEAN FOR AT SO NO NO NO MY PARTICULAR FRIEND WENT INTO THE WAR AND SHE HAD A VERY INTERESTING TIME AS OUT IN WASHINGTON ER WORKING FOR THE NOT NAVEL THE AIR FORCE THE WREN WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE YES YES LIKE THE UNIFORM TO JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT IT AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE AND THE WORK AND STUFF ERM WELL ERM AS SECRETARY TO THE CHIEF DESIGNER IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS A QUESTION OF DOING ERM TYPING HE WOULD DICTATE HIS DESIGN REPORTS BECAUSE IT ALL HAD TO GO UP TO THE AIR MINISTRY FOR APPROVAL BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR AN ORDER FOR THESE PLANES OF COURSE AND IT WAS TYPING ALL THESE SHEETS OF DESCRIPTION OF THESE PLANES ERM AND THAT MEN SAY HE WAS A VERY UNDISCIPLINED MAN IN THE LEFT EVERYTHING TO THE LAST MINUTE SO ONE WAS WORKING QUITE LATE AT NIGHT VERY OFTEN TO GET IT DONE TO THE DEADLINE THAT THE MINISTRY HAD SET WHAT'S HIS NAME BASIL HENDERSON AND HE DESIGNED A SMALL PLANE CALLED THE ERM WHAT DO THEY CALL IT THE HENDY IT WAS A BREAKDOWN OF HIS NAME IT WAS BASIL HEN ERM IT'LL COME TO ME BUT IT WAS ROUND ABOUT THE TIME THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER CHAP DESIGNING THOSE SMALL PLANES ERM I CAN'T THINK OF HIS NAME NOW BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THE WAR WAS COMING ERM NOT REALLY NO I MEAN TO SAY THE BOYS THAT WE USED TO MEET AND MIX WITH BUT WERE MOSTLY ERM AIR FORCE TYPES OR GETTING INTERESTED IN THE AIR FORCE AND WE KNEW IT WAS THE FIVE O ONE SQUADRON THE AT FILTON ERM THAT MOST OF THEM FLEW WITH AND WE KNEW AT TIMES FROM THEIR CONVERSATION THAT THINGS WERE GETTING VERY NEAR BUT NOT REALLY NO NOT YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T PUTTING UP THE BARRICADES OR ANYTHING WHAT ABOUT THE OUTBREAK OF WAR DO YOU REMEMBER THAT I DO AND WE WERE ACTUALLY ON FILTON AERODROME WHEN THE THAT SUNDAY WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED IT WATCHING THESE LADS IN THEIR PLANES TAKING OFF PURELY FOR EXERCISE SO I MEAN DID THINGS CHANGE IN BRISTOL WHEN WAR BROKE OUT WHAT WAS THE CHANGE DO YOU REMEMBER I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY BECAUSE MOST OF MY LIFE WAS SPENT BETWEEN FISH PONDS AND YOU KNOW I VERY RARELY WENT THE OTHER WAY TOWARDS TOWN AND DIDN'T REALLY GET ANY FEELING OF WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE EVEN YOU KNOW I READ NOW ABOUT SOME OF THE GHASTLY THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBING YOU KNOW THE LOSS OF LIFE BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME DIRECTLY ERM MY PARENTS HAD A SHOP IN FISH BONES AND THEY STILL KEPT GOING YOU KNOW IN A QUIET SORT OF WAY DID YOU SEE THE BLITZ COULD YOU SEE WERE YOU IN WERE YOU IN ATE WHEN IT YES I WAS IN AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FIRM MOVED US TO LIVE IN SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BUSINESS OF TRAVELLING BUT WE DID HAVE A DAYLIGHT RAID IN YET AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC THEY THEY THEY SENT A SINGLE PLANE AND YOU SEE WE WERE ALL WORKING AWAY QUITE HAPPILY IN THE AIR RAID SIREN WENT AND I WAS BEING TAUGHT HOW TO PLAY BRIDGE BY THE FRIEND WHO WENT INTO THE AIR FORCE AND ERM WE DIDN'T TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE ARRAY TIRING BECAUSE WE NEVER HAD ANYTHING AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS THE MOST ALMIGHTY EXPLOSION AND THE WHOLE BUILDING SHOOK AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED A SINGLE PLANE HAD COME IN APPARENTLY IT CAME IN FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTHERN FRANCE AREA WHERE THE GERMANS HAD ERM AIRPORT AND HAD FLOWN UP THE BRISTOL CHANNEL TO SOMEWHERE NORTH OF GLOUCESTER PICKED UP THE RAILWAY LINE AND EIGHT RUNS ALONG THE RAILWAY LINE IF YOU KNOW THE BUILDING AND FLEW DOWN AND DROPPED THIS STRIP OF BOMBS ALONG THE FACTORY FORTUNATELY A COUPLE OF THEM DID GO OFF I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND IT WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SEEING A DEAD BODY BECAUSE I KNEW MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FACTORY BECAUSE OF WHO I WAS WORKING FOR AND ONE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOUSE IN SHIPPING BERRY WAS A WOMAN CALLED SISTER HOBBS WHO BECAME QUITE WELL KNOWN FOR THE WORK SHE DID IN THAT BLITZ AND SHE JUST CAUGHT HOLD OF ME AND SHE SAID COME ON WE'VE GOT TO GO UP TO THE BRICK FACTORY SHE SAID TO IDENTIFY THESE PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN KILLED AND YOU KNOW I WAS TAKEN WHAT IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE SORT OF TWENTY TWO AT TWENTY TWO TO SEE ALL THESE DISINTEGRATED BODIES AND I HADN'T SEEN A DEAD BODY BEFORE AND THAT WAS VERY TRAUMATIC WAS THAT DO YOU THINK A CATALIST FOR THINKING I WANT TO JOIN BECOME A WREN NO I DON'T THINK SO NO NO THAT WAS QUIETLY SIMMERING AWAY AND I THINK THE CATALIST IN THE END WAS WHEN MY BOSS MOVED HE WENT TO A FIRM WHICH AGAIN YOU MAY KNOW OF BOOZY AND HAWKS THEY HE WASN'T A MUSICIAN OR HE HADN'T MADE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE JOB THEY DID ORIGINALLY THEY WERE MAKING SPARE PARTS FOR SOME OF OUR GUN TURRETS AND THEY FOUND THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD DESIGN WHAT THEY WANTED AND THEY GOT HIM THEY HAD HUNTED HIM AND WHEN HE LEFT I WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH THE PERSON WHO GOT THE JOB AND I THOUGHT I WANT TO MOVE BUT I HAD TO WORK QUITE HARD TO GET INTO THE WRENS BECAUSE OF COURSE I WAS IN A RESERVED OCCUPATION I WAS GOING TO ASK WAS IT I ASSUMED IT WAS A RESERVED OCCUPATION SO YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCEDURE TO GET OUT YES AND THEY WEREN'T THE WRENS WEREN'T OPEN FOR RECRUITMENT ANYHOW AND AT THAT TIME WE WERE BEING ERM DRAWN I SUPPOSE IS THE WORD FOR THE WAR ARTIST A MAN CALLED LEOPOLD FREEDMAN I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RUN TO EARTH SINCE I'VE TRIED BECAUSE HE DID LIKE A MURAL OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THE FACTORY AND IT WENT TO THE NATIONAL WHAT'S THE ONE IN TRAFALGAR NATIONAL ART GALLERY IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE ERM AND I WAS SITTING YOU KNOW WELL HE WAS DRAWING ME AND TALKING TO HIM AND I SAID I WANTED TO JOIN THE WRENS AND THE PROBLEM WAS THERE WERE NO VACANCIES AND I WAS IN A RESERVED OCCUPIES SO HE GAVE ME THE NAME OF A WOMAN AGAIN I FORGOTTEN HER NAME BUT SHE WAS THE HEAD OF THE MINISTRY OF LABOUR IN LONDON SO I'D GO OFF TO LONDON TO SEE THIS WOMAN AND SHE SHE TOLD ME THE SORT OF INSIDE SECRET THAT I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN FAIRLY SOON BECAUSE THE WRENS WERE EXPANDING AND THEY EXPANDED VERY RAPIDLY AND I GOT IN VERY EASILY THEN BUT I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THE DOORS OPEN BECAUSE THE LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY DIDN'T WANT WOMEN YOU KNOW THEY RELUCTANTLY TOOK THEM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR BUT YOU KNOW IT WAS A MAN'S SERVICE IT WASN'T FOR WOMEN BRILLIANT SO WHAT WAS THE PROCESS THEN FROM TRANSITIONING FROM BEING A SECRETARY IN TO BECOMING A WREN WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF IT YEAH I REMEMBER YOU KNOW HAVING MY PAPERS AND BEING SENT TO LEEDS BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY SUDDENLY EXPANDED THEY HAD TO OPEN NEW TRAINING DEPOTS I WAS IN MY EARLY TWENTIES AND ERM I HAD WHAT THEY CALL A WHITE PAPER ERM WHICH WAS A RECOMMENDATION FOR A COMMISSION AS SOON AS YOU WERE INTERVIEWED IN YOU KNOW MOST GIRLS HAVE TO WAIT AND WORK A WHILE BUT I WAS OLDER AND I THINK THEY SAW ME AS A POSSIBLE ADMIRAL OFFICER WELL THEY DID ACTUALLY BUT THEN I WENT FROM LEEDS AFTER I DID MY BASIC TRAINING TO ROCHESTER WHICH IS REALLY THE CHATHAM NOW I HAD SEEN MYSELF IS BOAT'S CREW YOU KNOW AND BECAUSE I WAS A BRISTOLIA I WANTED TO GO TO PLYMOUTH WHICH WAS BUT THE NAVY HAD OTHER IDEAS SO THEY SENT ME TO BE TO GO TO TRAINING FOR AN ADMIRAL OFFICER AT CHATHAM REALLY ERM ANYHOW THEY PUT ME IN WHAT'S CALLED THE REGULATING OFFICE WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHERE YOU MONITOR PEOPLE COMING IN AND GOING OUT AND TELEPHONES AND ERM I ALWAYS REMEMBER THE FIRST OFFICER WHO WAS THE ONE IN CHARGE WAS A VERY VERY DURABLE WOMAN ERM AND SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY CALLED LADY BURTON SHARE WHO LIVED IN HOVE AND EVERY SATURDAY AFTERNOON LADY BURTON SHAW WOULD RING UP HER DAUGHTER JUST FOR A CHAT AND I WAS PUT ON THE TELEPHONE WELL I NEVER NEVER WORKED AT IT YOU KNOW THOSE PLUGGING TELEPHONES I NEVER WORKED ONE OF THOSE AND OF COURSE LADY BURTON SHAW COMES THROUGH AND I WAS A PANIC YOU KNOW I WASN'T VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT IT OF COURSE WHAT DO I DO IN A VERY MIDDLE OF THE CONVERSATION I PULLED THE PLUG OUT YOU SEE SO I HAD TO GO IN SHE CALLED ME IN AND SHE SAID WHO'S ON THE TELEPHONE SO I SAID IT WAS ME MAM SO SHE SAID YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A BROKEN REED AND I THOUGHT WELL NOBODY HAS EVER CALLED ME A BROKEN REED BEFORE BUT YOU KNOW IT DID ME AS A WORLD OF GOOD I THOUGHT I WAS GOD'S GIFT TO THE NAVY YOU SEE AND I WASN'T AT ALL BUT THAT REMARK REALLY HAS STUCK WITH ME ALL MY LIFE WERE YOU WERE YOU SUE ME FOR IT WERE YOU A CHATHAM RATING YES OKAY SO DO YOU KNOW WHY ERM I SUPPOSE I WAS OR COMMAND IT WAS DID YOU GO TO CHATHAM WELL NOT ONLY IN SORT OF VISIT BECAUSE WE WERE BILLETED IN ROCHESTER AND BECAUSE I WAS DOING THE ADMIN WORK IN THE OFFICE THE OFFICE WAS ATTACHED TO THE ERM BILLET HOW DID YOU FIND MOVING AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE YOU BEEN OUT OF BRISTOL AT THIS POINT ERM NOT VERY FAR NO THAT WAS ANOTHER THING YOU DIDN'T TRAVEL FAR YOU KNOW HOLIDAYS WERE WELL THE FURTHEST WE WENT WAS TENBY IN SOUTH WALES BUT I HAD BEEN TO LONDON ERM AND I HAD BEEN TO FRANCE ON A SCHOOL TRIP ERM ONCE BUT NO NOT VERY FAR WE WEREN'T VERY WELL OFF ANYHOW AS A FAMILY YOU KNOW WE HAD TO CUT OUR CORNERS SO AFTER ROCHESTER THEN WHERE DID YOU WHERE DID YOU GO THEN WELL WHEN I WAS AT ROCHESTER ERM THE FIRST OFFICER I WAS TELLING YOU CALLED ME A BROKEN REED ERM I WAS IN THE ERM WHAT DO THEY CALL IT NOW SORT OF THE OFFICE WHICH ALLOCATED POSTINGS TO THE GIRLS BECAUSE ALL THE GIRLS THERE WERE WAITING TO BE SENT SOMEWHERE AND I WAS THERE AND NOTHING CAME IN BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAME IN FROM THE ADMIRALTY AND NOTHING CAME IN I WAS INTERESTED IN I WAS DOWN FOR ADMIN AND THEN I FOUND THAT TO DO ADMIN I HAD TO GO TO LOWESTOFT TO THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE WHERE THEY TRAINED ADMIN OFFICERS AND I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A LONG WAITING LIST AND I THOUGHT WELL I DIDN'T JOIN THE NAVY TO SIT IN AN OFFICE AND WAIT FOR THAT SO I WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO AND I SAID NO SO THEY SAID WELL YOU REALIZE YOU'LL GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST I SAID WELL I DIDN'T JOIN TO HAVE A COMMISSION ANYHOW YOU KNOW I JOIN YOU AND DO A JOB SO SHE SAID TO ME IF YOU SEE ANYTHING COMING THROUGH IT WAS A TELE PRINTER IN THOSE DAYS LET ME KNOW AND I'LL SEE I SAID WELL ALL I KNOW IS I DON'T WANT TO WORK IN LONDON I DON'T MIND WHERE ELSE I GO AND YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO STICK WITH MY SHORTHAND AND SORT OF GENERAL OFFICE WORK OK SHE SAID SO IN COMES IT WAS AT THE TIME IN GENERAL EISENHOWER WAS ERM GETTING TO BE QUITE WELL KNOWN AS A COMMANDER AND HE SET UP IF YOU REMEMBER SHE AND I LOOKED IT SOMETHING CAME IN WITH A N C STROKE SHAPE AND I THOUGHT WELL THAT'S INTERESTING AND THE A N C F WAS THE ALLIED NAVAL COMMANDER EXPEDITIONARY FORCE AND THAT WAS ADMIRAL RAMSEY AND I THOUGHT THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING YOU KNOW SO I'M GOING TO SAID COULD I HAVE MY NAME PUT UP FOR THAT VACANCY AND SO SHE AGREED AND YOU KNOW YOU HAD TO TAKE YOUR CHANCE WHAT OTHER APPLICATIONS THEY HAD AND ERM I GOT IT AND I SAID WHERE IS IT SO SHE SAID WELL TO START WITH YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO NORFOLK SQUARE IN LONDON WHICH IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF SHAPE AND THE NEXT GROUP WERE COLLECTING THERE AND THEY WERE MOSTLY WRENS WHO WERE GOING TO DO THE DAY PLANNING BUT I GOT BECAUSE I'D PUT IN FOR A STROKE SHAPE I GOT ATTACHED TO THE THIS IS WHERE ADMIRAL PARRY CAME IN TO ADMIRAL PARRY WHO TYPICALLY BRITISH WE HADN'T STARTED DAY BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS ALL READY POST OPERATIVE PLANNING AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS I THOUGHT WELL WE HAVEN'T WON THE WAR WE ARE THEY PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE YOU SEE AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS CAUGHT UP IN THAT FROM THEN ON I WAS ATTACHED TO HIM AND SENT TO BUSHY PARK IN HERTFORDSHIRE NOT HARTFORDSHIRE ERM IT'S NEAR HAMPTON COURT PALACE AND IT WAS GENERALIZING HEADQUARTERS FOR THEY WERE COLLECTING ALL THE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE PEOPLE THERE YOU KNOW WELL THE TROOPS WERE BEING COLLECTED AROUND AND SUSSEX AND PLACES SORRY IT'S MY NERVES JEREMY DON'T ERM AND ERM I THOUGHT I DON'T WANT TO GO TO LONDON BUT ANYHOW IN THE END THEY SAID WELL YOU'LL ONLY BE HELD THERE UNTIL AND I WAS ONLY HELD THERE A DAY I CAN REMEMBER SITTING ON THE WALL OUTSIDE NORFOLK HOUSE WHICH IS WHERE THE LONDON GROUP WERE AND TOLD TO WAIT AND SOMEBODY WOULD PICK ME UP BECAUSE FROM THEN ON IT BECAME HIGHLY SECRETIVE I WAS SITTING LIKE A LONELY RED WAS MY NAVAL CASE THEN NOTHING ELSE AND A JEEP CAME ZOOMING AROUND THE SQUARE AND AN AMERICAN STOPPED BY MY ANYWAY SO YOU RAY AND IRENE BALMY GO AND A BUSHY PARK WELL I SAID I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING I'VE JUST BEEN TOLD TO SIT ON THIS WALL SO HE SAID HE GOT ME ABOARD HIS SHEEP AND WE WENT THROUGH THAT IT WASN'T FAR FROM NORFOLK TO GET OUT OF LONDON WENT TO BUSHY PARK THAT WAS AND OF COURSE WHEN I GET TO BUSHY PARK I'M THE ONLY WREN THERE BECAUSE IT WAS A SEPARATE UNIT TO THE BIG GROUP THAT WERE AT NORFOLK HOUSE WHAT YEAR WAS THAT HER FORTY FOUR I THINK FORTY FOUR FORTY FIVE YEAR HAVE YOU JUST DESCRIBED THE SET UP AT BUSHY PARK AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE BEFORE D DAY ERM WELL BUSHY PARK ERM I PRESUME IT'S A SORT OF LOCAL IT'S A VERY LARGE PARK AND IN IT WERE PORTER CABINS IN WHICH BY THEN YOU GOT THE BRITISH AND THE FRENCH AND AMERICANS WHO WERE THE FOURTH ONE NOT AS CANADIANS YES WELL THERE WERE A FEW BUT NOT MANY BUT I WAS THINKING OF THE GROUP THEY SPLIT GERMANY UP INTO REGIONS DIDN'T THEY THERE WAS THE BRITISH RUSSIA RUSSIAN BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER RUSSIANS BEING AT BUSHY PARK I THINK THEY LINKED UP LATER BUT I REMEMBER BEING IN ONE OF THESE WE HAD OUR OFFICE AND THIS IS WHERE I DID ACTUALLY WE COULDN'T SAY I MET HIM BUT THE DOODLE BUGS HAD STARTED FLYING AND WE THEY GOT THEY HAD BUSHY PARK IN THEIR SIGHTS AND THEY GOT VERY NEAR US SO THERE WERE AIR RAID SHELTERS BUILT SPECIALLY AND A LOT OF THE AMERICANS PARTICULARLY THE WOMEN IN THE AMERICAN ARMY HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE AND THEY JUST WENT TO PIECES IF THERE WAS AN AIR RAID THEY WERE TERRIBLY NERVOUS LOT BUT I QUITE ENJOYED BEING WITH THEM BECAUSE IT WAS A DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE ALTOGETHER THEIR METHOD OF EATING AND THE EQUIPMENT THEY GAVE US YOU KNOW AND THE GENE THAT WAS PUT IN SO I WAS I WAS UNDER ERM ATS SUPERVISION ER AND SOMEBODY CALLED LADY BRECKNORK I THINK SHE BECAME QUITE A POWER IN THE LAND AFTERWARDS FROM A POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW BUT SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF US AND SHE AND I RESENTED HER BECAUSE SHE SHE USED TO OPEN MY POST WHICH OF COURSE THE NAVY NEVER OPENED YOUR POST BUT OF COURSE BECAUSE I WAS UNDER UNDER ATS RULE ALL OUR POST WAS OPENED AND LADY BRICK LOCK ALWAYS MADE A POINT OF READING AND REMEMBERING WHAT WAS IN AND I WAS ALWAYS SENDING HOME FOR MONEY AND AND SHE WAS ALWAYS SAYING YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED MONEY YOU'VE GOT PLENTY EVEN THOUGH YOU SHOULD MANAGE ON WHAT YOU'VE GOT THAT WAS SEVEN AND SIX WEEKS SO FROM THERE ERM DID YOU MEET EISENHOWER WELL YES NO I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE DOODLE BUGS AND IF HE WAS ON SIGHT IN HIS OFFICE HE DIDN'T COME VERY OFTEN BECAUSE OF COURSE HIS RESPONSIBILITY WAS ENORMOUS AND THE PLACES YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAID OH ISENHOUR WAS THERE BUT THEY WERE NEVER THERE FOR LONG BUT HE DID USE THE AIR RAID SHELTER WHICH WAS THE SAME SHELTER THAT WE USED BECAUSE WE WERE IN ADJOINING OFFICES BUT YOU KNOW HE HE HARDLY SAW US BECAUSE HE POPPED DOWN AND ALL HIS ENTOURAGE WOULD BE WITH HIM BUT I MEAN TO SAY WE DIDN'T FEEL WE WERE LESS THAN HIM YOU KNOW HE ALWAYS HAD A WORD TO SAY BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY SAY YOU MET HIM YOU KNOW AND WHEN DID OR PARRY COME ONTO THESE THINGS ERM NOT ACTUALLY UNTIL I WENT ACROSS TO FRANCE BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME ONE OF HIS SIDEKICKS WAS A CAPTAIN ON WHO HAD BEEN THE ERM PORTUGUESE THE IT WASN'T AN ATTACHE SORT OF THE NAVAL REPRESENTATIVE IN LISBON AND SO WHEN HE JOINED US ON THE STAFF OF ADMIRAL PARRY I WAS ATTACHED TO HIM AND HE ALWAYS CALLED ME HIS MARINA DO YOU KNOW I NEVER ACTUALLY SPOKEN TO A PORTUGUESE TO FIND OUT I WAS TOLD IT MEANT FRIEND BUT I WAS ALWAYS HE ALWAYS TOLD PEOPLE IF THEY WANTED SOMETHING GOING ASK MY MARINA BUT HE HE WAS A VERY GENTLE VERY NICE MAN WHO ABOUT WHOM I KNEW NEVER HEARD MUCH ABOUT HIM AT ALL I KNOW ADMIRAL PARRY ERM AT THE END OF THE WAR I THINK HE WAS AN APPLE GROWER IN KENT AND THAT'S WHAT HIS RETIREMENT THAT'S WHAT HE DID BUT CAPTAIN ON I NEVER KNEW WHAT DID YOU SENSE WHAT DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS ESCALATION TOWARDS D DAY HOW HOW SORT OF PRIVY TO IT WERE YOU OH ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH I WASN'T IN THE TYPING POOL AS IT WAS I KNEW I'D SEEN PAPERS GOING THROUGH AND YOU KNEW WHAT THE PLANNING WAS AND YOU SAY IT WAS TOP SECRET JUST DESCRIBE THE SECRECY PROCESS WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO BE YOU KNOW WELL YEAH WELL IT WAS A BIGOT WAS THE THE THIRD LEVEL WHICH WAS THE ABSOLUTELY I DON'T THINK WE COULD EVER GET THROUGH THERE WERE SPECIAL LINES AND THINGS ON THE TELEPHONE AND IT WAS MOSTLY FOR USE BY TELEPHONE BUT I NEVER REALLY KNEW HOW THEY DECIDED I KNEW WHEN I HAD TO IF I HAD TO MAKE A CALL WHICH LINE I HAD TO USE WHETHER IT WAS THE ORDINARY ONE THE TOP SECRET OR BIGGER BUT I NEVER KNEW WHEN SAY CAPTAIN OWEN WAS WANTING ME TO DO SOMETHING AND HE SAID THAT WILL BE BIGGER HOW HE KNEW IT HAD TO BE BIGGER YOU KNOW THAT WAS SOMETHING KNOWN TO HIM IS BIG ABOVE TOP SECRET YES YEAH JUST DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR JOB WAS THEN WHAT WERE YOU ACTUALLY DOING ERM PREDOMINANTLY I WAS IN LONDON WELL MAINLY ERM DOING THE ADMIRALS OR CAPTAIN WHICHEVER ONE WAS AROUND DOING THEM THEIR POST AND TAKING DICTATION AND WHAT PLANNING THEY HAD TO DO IN TERMS OF POST OFFICE MOST OF THE POST OPERATIVE STUFF WAS THE DIVISION OF THE GERMAN NAVY WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER YOU KNOW WHO WAS GOING TO HAVE WHAT AND THAT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE OF COURSE THE RUSSIANS WANTED EVERYTHING THIS WAS MUCH FURTHER ON WHEN WE WERE IN BERLIN BUT THE RUSSIANS ALWAYS WANTED ALL THE BIG STUFF YOU KNOW AND WE KNEW ALL THE BEST EQUIPMENT WAS IN THE SMALLER DESTROYERS AND THINGS SO WE WENT FOR THOSE ERM SO YOU KNOW THEY WERE WORKING OUT ALL THOSE SORT OF THINGS OF COURSE IT ALL HAD TO GO UP THROUGH THE ADMIRALTY AND BACK AGAIN SO IT ALL TOOK TIME BUT IT WAS JUST STRAIGHT FORWARD SHORT OUT REPORTING THE POST OPERATIVE PLANNING EVEN BEFORE D DAY YEAH DID YOU DID YOU EVER MEET ANY YOU KNOW WERE THERE ANY OTHER LIKE CHURCHILL ANY OF THE OTHER BIG WIGS I NEVER SAW CHURCHILL MONTGOMERY ERM WE WHEN WE WERE IN GERMANY IT WAS A FASHION TO HAVE A DOG AND I NEVER HAD ONE BUT MY FRIEND HAD ONE WHICH HE CALLED FRAT BECAUSE THAT OF COURSE WAS NO FRATERNIZATION AND I REMEMBER WE HAD AN OFFICE WE WERE IN FRANKFORT AT THE TIME AND THE OFFICE THERE HAD A SORT OF STAIRCASE GOING UP AND PADDY ALWAYS TOOK FRAT TO WORK WITH NOBODY MIND BECAUSE THE WAR WAS OVER BUT BY THEN AND WE WERE GOING UP STAIRS ONE DAY AND SOMEBODY SAID WATCH OUT ONE IS COMING AND HE WAS IN THE BUILDING AT SOME MEETING AND HE WAS COMING AGAIN WITH HIS ONTO DOWN THE STAIRS AS WE WERE GOING UP YOU SEE AND APPARENTLY HE DIDN'T DO IT IN FRONT OF US BUT WHEN HE GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE HE TOLD HIS ADJUTANT TO CONTACT WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WRENS TO SAY THAT HE DIDN'T WANT DOGS IN THE BUILDING IS A TYPICAL SO IF YOU YOU WERE VERY PRIVY TO ALL THIS STUFF WHEN DID YOU KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BE JUNE THE FIFTH OR SIXTH DID YOU KNOW THAT ERM WELL YES BECAUSE YOU KNOW OF THE DELAY DO YOU MEAN DAY YEAH BECAUSE OF THE DELAY YOU KNOW WE BUT YOU SO YOU KNEW THAT THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE DAY THAT THE LANDINGS WERE HAPPENING DID YOU EVER GO YES WELL IT WAS IT YOU DID AND YOU DIDN'T YOU KNOW THERE WERE ALWAYS THINGS BEING SAID TO PUT YOU OFF SO THAT YOU WENT A HUNDRED PERCENT SHORE BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYBODY WAS REALLY BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER AND THINGS BUT WE WERE WHEN I WAS AT CHATHAM AND THERE WASN'T YOU KNOW WE DONE ALL THE WORK WE HAD TO DO AND WE WERE WAITING ERM WE WERE SENT CHERRY PICKING THE KENT ORCHARDS AND THAT WAS AMAZING BECAUSE ALL THE LANE ROADS ALL ROUND SORT OF KENT AND THE SORT OF AREA GOING DOWN TO THE COAST WAS FULL OF ARMY VEHICLES AND MEN WAITING AND YOU KNEW THAT THEY WERE THERE READY TO GO BUT I THINK THAT'S HOW I LEARNED RATHER THAN THROUGH THE OFFICE SO AFTER BUSH YOU WENT BACK TO CHATHAM DID YOU BACK OVER TO BUSH I'VE GOT TO GET BECAUSE I DETERMINED NO I FROM BUSHY PARK ERM WE WERE MOVED BACK TO LONDON AND I WORKED IN PRINCES GARDENS THERE AND WE LIVED IN ENGLAND LANE IN SORT OF ENGLAND'S LANE IT SORT OF SWISS COTTAGE WAY AND THERE WAS A NURSES HOME THERE I THINK IT WAS A CHERRY CROSS NURSES HOME AND THEY USED THAT FOR WREN BILLET AND THEN USED TO TRAVEL I TRAVELLED TO ERM IN GARDENS FROM THERE AND IT WAS FROM PRINCES GARDENS THAT I WAS DRAFTED OVER TO FRANCE CAN YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU FELT WHEN YOU FOUND OUT YOU BEGAN FOLLOWING THE EXPEDITION I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I FELT THAT I AM STILL THAT MY NAVAL LIFE WAS ANYTHING BUT NAVY YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE I HAD GREAT GREAT IDEAS OF BEING BOATS CREW AS I SAID GOING TO SEA WITH A MAIL ERM SO I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE INLAND AS IT WERE BUT ONCE I GOT USED TO IT AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN ADVENTURE AS WELL IN GOING OVER DID YOU SAIL TO FRANCE WE WENT YOU KNOW THERE'S ERM BUT THEY TOOK THE TROOPS OVER IN THE WE WENT OVER BECAUSE ACTUALLY ERM WHEN IT CAME TO IT THE WAR WAS THAT THE ARMY WAS ALMOST IN BERLIN BY THEN SO THEY FELT IT WAS SAFE TO PUT THE GIRLS OVER ERM AND WE WENT ACROSS TO A LITTLE TOWN IN NORMANDY CALLED GRAVEL ON THE DUCKS WE CALLED THEM YOU KNOW D U K K THOSE LIKE LANDING CRAFT ERM AND I WAS TERRIBLY SICK I MAY SAY IT PROVED TO ME I WASN'T A SAFE THEN THEY WERE DESCRIBE THE SORT OF THE DAY THAT YOU WENT ON THE LANDING CRUS TO FRANCE JUST GOING BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THE STORY AND WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF YOU KNOW THAT DAY WHERE DID YOU SAIL FROM AND WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LIKE CAN YOU REMEMBER YES THE WEATHER WASN'T TOO GOOD HENCE THE FACT THAT I WAS ERM I SUPPOSE I THINK THEY WERE PROBABLY NEARLY BETWEEN FIFTY AND HUNDRED OF US GOING NOT ONLY WRENS BUT THE ERM TRY TO THINK WE WENT FROM ONE ONE OF THE LITTLE PORTS THEY WEREN'T REALLY PORTS THAT WERE AROUND THE BLEY RIVER THAT THAT WAY ERM WE WERE EXCITED WE DIDN'T YOU KNOW YOU HAD ALL SORTS OF IMAGINATIONS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN CROSSING THE CHANNEL MIGHT SINK YOU KNOW YOU'D BE ABLE TO SWIM FAR ENOUGH AND THE YOU KNOW THEY WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WATER WHEN WE GOT THE OTHER SIDE LIKE YOU SEE THE MEN YOU KNOW TRAILING OUT WITH ALL THEIR STUFF THROUGH WATER THEY MANAGED TO BEACH US SO WE WERE QUITE DRY WHEN WE GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE AND YOU KNOW THE FRENCH ACTUALLY IN NORMANDY WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING THEY WERE VERY PLEASED TO SEE US THEY WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN MY VIEW TO THE ONES WE MET IN PARIS WHAT WAS IT OBVIOUSLY WATER OH YES YES YOU KNOW THE ERM CASE IT WOULD BE AFTER D DAY OF COURSE WE WEREN'T ACROSS SO THINGS WERE STILL PRETTY BROKEN YOU KNOW ALL THE SORT OF FRONT LINE HOUSES AND THINGS WERE ALL BASHED ABOUT CASE THEY'D BEEN BOMBARDED OF COURSE FROM THE SEA AND AND AND GRANVILLE WHAT WAS THE SET UP THERE AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE STILL IN A WAR ZONE BASICALLY AREN'T YOU IT WAS A WAR ZONE WELL IT WAS JUST A SORT OF GETTING OFF POINT FOR MOVING PEOPLE ON BEHIND THE ARMY I THINK IT WAS FELT TO BE A REASONABLE PLACE TO START MOVING BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF EQUIPMENT AS WELL WE DIDN'T BUT THE ARMY AND THE AIR FORCE AND THE NAVY FOR THAT MATTER ALL HAD EQUIPMENT TO MOVE UP WITH US ERM AND I THINK I PROBABLY HAD A LITTLE TOWN WAS CONSIDERED YOU KNOW THEY HAD ERM GOOD ROAD NOT GOOD BUT THE TRANSPORT SITUATION MOVING STUFF WAS REASONABLE BUT VERY BASIC LIVING CONDITIONS YOU KNOW WE HAD NO RUNNING WATER OR ERM ER WE HAD SORT OF THINGS LIKE YOUR TRIPOD WITH CANVAS BAGS IN THEM WHICH WE USED THIS WASHING MACHINE WELL ERM FOR WASHING WHAT WAS THERE IT WAS LIKE THE CAMPING REALLY FROM THE LIVING POINT OF VIEW AND VERY LITTLE WORK WE HAD AT THAT TIME AND WHAT WERE YOU JUST WRITING OR DID YOU HAVE TELEPRINTERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WAS THERE ANY TECHNOLOGY OH YES THERE WAS A LOT OF BUT NOT IN THE GROUP I WAS WITH DID YOU KNOW THAT ACTUALLY THE FIRST PEOPLE TO GO OVER WITH THE COMMUNICATORS ERM THE TELEPHONE OPERATORS AND SO ON AND OF COURSE THEY WERE STILL THE ENGINEERS WERE STILL FITTING UP FIELD ERM EQUIPMENT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND THERE WERE A LOT OF WRENS IN THAT GROUP TREMENDOUS LUMBER AND ERM FROM GRANVILDERM YOU KNOW THEY FOUND THAT THE WORK THEY WANTED ME TO DO WAS MORE CENTRED BACK IN LONDON SO I WAS SHIPPED BACK TO LONDON TO WAIT UNTIL THEY ER PREPARED WHAT WE NEEDED ERM OR I HAD TO HELP DO THAT AND WE WENT THEN TO PARIS BUT I WENT FROM LONDON FROM ENGLAND'S LANE THAT WAS TO ERM PARIS ON MY OWN AND THEN I REALLY WAS NOT BEING ANYWHERE ON MY OWN BEFORE ERM ER THEY I WAS MET WHEN I GOT TO ERM THE GUAR DONOR BECAUSE I WENT OVER ON THE TRAIN ERM BY ANOTHER WREN WHO'D BEEN OVER AND THEN WE WERE I WAS BILLETED AND WORKED IN A CHATEAU IN ERM WELL IT'S A SUBURB OF PARIS ANYHOW AND I WORKED THERE FOR A VERY SHORT TIME AND THEN THE ERM ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP WERE FOLLOWING ON BEHIND THE ARMY AND WE WENT FROM PARIS TO FRANKFURT AND I DIDN'T ENJOY FRANKFORT VERY MUCH BECAUSE THERE WASN'T MUCH TO DO BY NOW YOU KNOW MOST OF THE PLANNING HAD BEEN DONE AND LIFE BECAME RATHER SORT OF THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY POINT IN WHAT WE WERE DOING WE'D DONE IT ALL YOU KNOW SO IT WAS A BIT OF A PLAYGROUND WAS THIS AT THE END OF THIS AFTER THE WAR YEAH I SAY THE THE ERM TROOPS THAT HAD ENTERED BERLIN ERM AND WE WERE BACK IN PARIS SO IT WAS SORT OF JUST AS THE WAR WAS ENDING THE FIRST YES IT HAD ENDED BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME IN PARIS ERM WERE THE ERM FASHIONS YOU KNOW THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HATS MADE OUT OF CLEAN PAPER YOU KNOW SWEET PAPERS AND THINGS THE WOMEN HAD MADE THEY SEEMED UNTOUCHED BY THE WAR IN PARIS THEY DIDN'T MUCH LIKE US I DON'T THINK I THINK THE GERMANS HAD GIVEN THEM QUITE A GOOD TIME WERE YOU WITH ADMIRAL PARRY THEN AT THIS POINT NO I MET ADMIRAL PARRY WHEN I GOT TO PARIS AND WAS A AS A PERSON VERY QUIET YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T REALLY FEEL YOU KNOW HE COULD HIT ANYBODY THAT TO KILL ANYBODY BUT ERM AND OR EVEN DISCIPLINE ANYBODY HE WAS ALWAYS VERY GENTLE AND VERY NICE TO WORK FOR BUT VERY CLEVER OF COURSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WANTED AND JUST DESCRIBE SORT OF THE WORKING RELATIONSHIP WHAT YOU DID FOR HIM AND WHAT THE PURPOSE OF YOUR BEING THERE WAS ERM DO YOU MEAN YOU MEAN YOU SEE MOST OF THE HE HE REALLY WOULD HAVE COMMUNICATED TO CAPTAIN ON MOST OF WHAT HE WANTED BECAUSE HE'D BE OFF DOING SOMETHING ELSE ERM BUT SO THAT CAPTAIN OWEN WAS REALLY THE PERSON WHO WAS GIVING ME WORK WHEN THERE WAS WORK TO BE DONE BUT ADMIRAL PARRY CERTAINLY WAS VERY APPROACHABLE YOU KNOW AND HE MIXED WITH US THERE WAS NO SORT OF OFFICERS AND OTHERS EVERYBODY MIXED AND HE 'S A DIFFICULT MAN TO DESCRIBE REALLY NICELY DESCRIBED ON THE YOU KNOW BUT THE WHEN WE WERE IN BERLIN YOU DO YOU KNOW BERLIN AT ALL IN THE LAKES THE VANS THE LAKES THAT ARE ON THE OUTSKIRTS BUT WHEN WE WERE LIVING IN WHAT HAD BEEN THE JAPANESE EMBASSY IN BERLIN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AND IT WAS IN THAT DISTRICT WHERE THE LAKES WERE BUT I ALWAYS SAID THE VAN THE LAKES AND THEY WOULD FREEZE OVER IN THE WINTER BECAUSE WE HAD A WINTER THERE AND YOU KNOW THE ADMIRAL WOULD ARRANGE SKATING PARTIES AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE THE ICE THERE SO THICK BECAUSE IT'S SO COLD THAT YOU COULD HAVE BARBECUES ON THE ICE YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE LIFE BECAME A BIT SUPERFICIAL ERM LATTERLY WHEN THERE WASN'T MUCH WORK TO DO YOU KNOW YOU REALLY FELT YOU SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE DOING SOME WORK AND HOW DID YOU GET FROM PARIS INTO FRANKFORT THEN ARE YOU ON RAILWAYS WERE YOU IN VEHICLES OR ON NAVAL JEEPS MOST OF THE TRAVELLING WE DID THE ONLY ONLY THING WHEN I WENT FROM FRANKFORT TO BERLIN I HAD BEEN HOME ON LEAVE AND WHEN I GOT BACK IT WAS TO FIND THAT DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY THEY COULDN'T ERM NOTIFY ME THEY COULDN'T GET HOLD OF ME TO LET ME KNOW THAT THE MAIN PARTY HAD GONE ON TO BERLIN AND WHEN I GOT BACK TO FRANKFORT I HAD TO GO AND REPORT TO ONE OF THE ARMY OFFICERS TO GET TRANSPORT AND WHEN I GOT THERE I FOUND A MESSAGE TO SAY THAT GENERAL EISENHOWER SHE HAD MARRIED ONE OF OUR WRENS AND THEY WERE VERY FRIENDLY BEFORE I WENT AND HE LET THEM HAVE HIS HOUSE IN NEAR FRANKFORT ERM FOR THEIR HONEYMOON AND THEY WERE BOTH DUE BACK IN BERLIN AND THEY WOULD GIVE ME A LIFT SO I WENT FREEZING UP THE OTTOMAN FROM FRANKFORT TO BERLIN AND GENERALIZED THAN OURS CAR AMAZING WHAT WAS BERLIN LIKE WHAT WAS THE POSTWAR BURNING ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED YEAH THAT REALLY DID SHAKE ME WHEN I SAW IT YOU KNOW THERE WAS ALMOST EVERY BUILDING WE SAW WAS DESTROYED AND THERE WERE THESE AND THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY OLD WOMEN BUT THEY LOOKED OLD BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL HUNCHED UP YOU KNOW IN DARK CLOTHES WITH WHEELBARROWS CLEARING STREETS AND WORKING SO HARD AND LITTLE FOOD YOU KNOW THEY WERE WORKING WITH VERY LITTLE STRENGTH BUT I MUST GIVE THE GERMANS THEY DID WORK HARD TO GET BERLIN BACK DID YOU GO TO THE BRANDENBURG GATE OR THE TELL ME ABOUT SOME OF THAT WELL THAT AGAIN WAS MORE LIKE A TOURIST TRIP YOU KNOW I'D BEEN TRYING TO THINK WHAT OUR OFFICE IN BERLIN WAS LIKE DID YOU BY THEN OF COURSE IT WAS A CONTROL COMMISSION AND ERM I CAN'T VISUALIZE IT AT ALL IT'S AN ABSOLUTE BLANK IN MY MEMORY I CAN REMEMBER THE WEARY THE JAPANESE EMBASSY AND I CAN REMEMBER GOING ON THE TRAM FROM THERE TO THE OFFICE BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OFFICE AT ALL AND BECAUSE I WAS THERE FOR NEARLY A YEAR BUT ERM YOU KNOW WE WENT TO SEE THE BUNKER YOU KNOW WHERE HITLER WAS KILLED AND THAT WAS STILL IN YOU KNOW PRETTY ROUGH STATE YOU KNOW BITS OF FURNITURE WAS STILL THERE YOU KNOW IT HADN'T BEEN TIDIED UP ERM WHAT WAS YOUR SENTIMENT TOWARDS THE GERMANS AT THE TIME WELL IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE ERM I FOUND THEM VERY HELPFUL BUT THEN AND YOU KNOW I QUITE LIKE THEM BUT OF COURSE THEY THEY HAD A LOT TO GAIN FROM US AND WE WAY OF FOOD AND SO ON THE RUSSIANS OF COURSE WERE THEY THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE STORY GOES THAT THE MAIN RUSSIAN ARMY THAT TOOK BERLIN THEY PULLED THEM BACK AND THEY REPLACED THEM WITH THE SORT OF THIRD LINE WHO WERE MONGOLIANS AND THEY WERE PRETTY ROUGH AND ON ONE OCCASION COMING HOME FROM THE OFFICE A COUPLE THEY USED TO DRINK OR FALL OFF ANY BOOS THEY GET HOLD OF A COUPLE OF VERY DRUNK RUSSIANS STARTED WE WERE WALKING HOME FROM THE OFFICE IN BERLIN TO OUR DIGS AND THEY STARTED GETTING THEIR GUNS OUT AND SHOOTING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND WE HAD TO JUMP IN THE HEDGE AND AFTER THAT TO KEEP OUT OF THEIR WAY AND AFTER THAT THEY PUT A FAIRLY STRONG MARINE PRESENCE ON THE YOU KNOW SORT OF GUARD ON AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO TRAVEL ON OUR OWN ERM SO YOU WERE PRETTY OK ON TRANSPORT WE GOT THE TRAM HOME IS IF YOU STARTED WALKING WE HAD A A GERMAN COOK IN THE WRENERYERM
