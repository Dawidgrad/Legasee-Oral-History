MY NAME IS IRENE BELLAMY JUST WHERE ARE YOU FROM I WAS FROM BRISTOL FROM THE FISH PONDS AREA WHERE I WAS BORN AND I WENT TO SCHOOL IN BRISTOL AND STARTED MY WORK AFTER SCHOOL IN BRISTOL HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN WAR BROKE OUT WELL I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN NINETEEN SO I WAS TWENTY WHAT WAS LIFE LIKE FOR YOU IN BRISTOL IN WHAT WHAT HAPPENED ME A BIT ABOUT YOUR SCHOOLING AND JUST LIKE IN BRITAIN SO I UNDERSTAND WHO YOU ARE I ORIGINALLY WENT TO A SMALL PRIVATE SCHOOL AND THEN WENT TO COLSTON FROM THERE BRISTOL ITSELF I FOUND RATHER DULL YOU KNOW IT WAS ALL PUBS AND CHURCHES THAT'S HOW IT SEEMED TO ME THEY WEREN'T THE FUN THINGS THAT THERE ARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY MOST OF OUR TIME EITHER GOING TO FREE TIME GOING TO THE CIA OR PLAYING SOME KIND OF GAMES I BELONGED TO YOU KNOW VARIOUS HOCKEY TEAMS AND TENNIS CLUBS DURING THE WAR OF COURSE WE WORKED VERY LONG HOURS AT EIGHT SO YOU WEREN'T LOOKING FOR MUCH LEISURE FUN AND I MOVED BECAUSE OF THE BRISTOL BLITZ DURING THAT TIME I WAS PUT BY THE FIRM THEY DIDN'T WANT US IN THE DANGER OF CENTRE OF BRISTOL AND SO ON SO THEY TOOK OVER A COTTAGE IN SHIPS IN SODBERRY AND I LIVED IN SHIPS IN SOBER FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THAT WAS QUITE GOOD FUN ACTUALLY THE SORT OF VILLAGE LIFE LOTS GOING ON BUT I'D ALWAYS HAD A END TO GO INTO THE NAVY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT MAINLY BECAUSE I HAD FRIENDS WHO HAD JOINED THE SERVICES WAS IT WRENS OVER ANY OTHER SERVICE I DIDN'T WANT TO JOIN DO YOU MEAN ENOUGH OR AT NO NO MY PARTICULAR FRIEND WENT INTO THE AND SHE HAD A VERY INTERESTING TIME OUT IN WASHINGTON WORKING FOR THE NAVAL THE AIR FORCE THE WREN WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE YES LIKE THE UNIFORM TO JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT IT AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE AND THE WORK AND STUFF WELL AS SECRETARY CHIEF DESIGNER IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS A QUESTION OF DOING TYPING HE WOULD DICTATE HIS DESIGN REPORTS BECAUSE IT ALL HAD TO GO UP TO THE AIR MINISTRY FOR APPROVAL BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING FOR AN ORDER FOR THESE PLANES OF COURSE AND IT WAS TYPING ALL THESE SHEETS OF DESCRIPTION OF THESE PLANES AND THAT HE WAS A VERY UNDISCIPLINED MAN IN THE LEFT EVERYTHING TO THE LAST MINUTE SO ONE WAS WORKING QUITE LATE AT NIGHT VERY OFTEN TO GET IT DONE TO THE DEADLINE THAT THE MINISTRY HAD SET HIS NAME BASIL HENDERSON AND HE DESIGNED A SMALL PLANE CALLED WHAT DO THEY CALL IT THE HENDY IT WAS A BREAKDOWN OF HIS NAME THEN IT'LL COME TO ME BUT IT WAS ROUND ABOUT THE TIME THERE WAS ANOTHER CHAP DESIGNING THOSE SMALL PLANES I CAN'T THINK OF HIS NAME NOW BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ABOUT NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT THAT WAR WAS COMING REALLY I MEAN TO SAY THE BOYS THAT WE USED TO MEET AND MIX WITH WERE MOSTLY AIRFORCE TYPES OR GOT INTERESTED IN THE AIR FORCE AND WE KNEW IT WAS THE FIVE ONE SQUADRON AT FILTON THAT MOST OF THEM FLEW WITH AND WE KNEW AT TIMES FROM THEIR CONVERSATION THAT THINGS WERE GETTING VERY NEAR BUT NOT REALLY YOU KNOW WE WEREN'T PUTTING UP THE BARRICADES OR ANYTHING ABOUT THE OUTBREAK OF WAR DO YOU REMEMBER THAT I DO AND WE WERE ACTUALLY ON FILTON AERODROME THAT SUNDAY WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED IT WATCHING THESE LADS IN THEIR PLANES TAKING OFF PURELY FOR EXERCISE DID THINGS CHANGE IN BRISTOL WHEN WAR BROKE OUT WHAT WAS THE CHANGE DO YOU REMEMBER I CAN'T HONESTLY SAY BECAUSE MOST OF MY LIFE WAS SPENT BETWEEN FISH PONDS AND AS YOU KNOW I VERY RARELY WENT THE OTHER WAY TOWARDS TOWN AND DIDN'T REALLY GET ANY FEELING OF WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE EVEN YOU KNOW I READ NOW ABOUT SOME OF THE GHASTLY THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE BOMBING A LOT OF LIFE BUT IT DIDN'T AFFECT ME DIRECTLY MY PARENTS HAD A SHOP IN FISH BONDS AND THEY STILL KEPT GOING IN A QUIET SORT OF WAY DID YOU SEE THE BLITZ COULD YOU WERE YOU WERE YOU IN WHEN IT YES I WAS IN THE IDEA AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE FIRM MOVED US TO LIVE IN SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE THE BUSINESS OF TRAVELLING BUT I HAVE A DAYLIGHT RAID IN YET AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC THEY SENT A SINGLE PLANE WE WERE ALL WORKING AWAY QUITE HAPPILY IN THE AIR RAID SIREN WENT AND I WAS BEING TAUGHT HOW TO PLAY BRIDGE BY THE FRIEND WHO WENT INTO THE AIR FORCE AND TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE ARRAY TIRED BECAUSE WE NEVER HAD ANYTHING AND SUDDENLY THERE WAS A MOST ALMIGHTY EXPLOSION AND THE WHOLE BUILDING SHOOK AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED A SINGLE PLANE HAD COME IN APPARENTLY IT CAME IN FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE NORTHERN FRANCE AREA WHERE THE GERMANS HAD AIRPORTS AND HAD FLOWN UP THE BRISTOL CHANNEL SOMEWHERE NORTH OF GLOUCESTER PICKED UP THE RAILWAY LINE AND HE RUNS ALONG THE RAILWAY LINE IF YOU KNOW THE BUILDING AND FLEW DOWN AND DROPPED THIS TRIP OF BOMBS ALONG THE FACTORY FORTUNATELY A COUPLE OF THEM DID GO OFF BUT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE WERE KILLED MY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF SEEING A DEAD BODY BECAUSE I KNEW MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE FACTORY BECAUSE OF WHO I WAS WORKING FOR AND ONE OF THE OTHER PEOPLE LIVING IN THE HOUSE IN CHIPPING SOBER WAS A WOMAN CALLED SISTER HOBBS WHO BECAME QUITE WELL KNOWN FOR THE WORK SHE DID IN THAT BLITZ AND SHE JUST CAUGHT HOLD OF ME AND SHE SAID COME ON WE'VE GOT TO GO UP TO THE BRICK FACTORY SHE SAID TO IDENTIFY THESE PEOPLE WHO'D BEEN KILLED AND YOU KNOW I WAS TAKEN WHAT IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE TWENTY TWO AT TWENTY TWO TO SEE ALL THESE DISINTEGRATED BODIES AND I HADN'T SEEN A DEAD BODY BEFORE AND THAT WAS VERY DRAMATIC WHAT DO YOU THINK OF CATALIST OF THINKING I WANTED TO JOIN AND BECOME A WREN NO I DON'T THINK SO THAT WAS QUIETLY SIMMERING AWAY I THINK THE CATALIST IN THE END WAS WHEN MY BOSS MOVED HE WENT TO A FIRM WHICH AGAIN YOU MAY KNOW OF BOOZY AND HAWKS HE WASN'T A MUSICIAN HE HADN'T MADE MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE JOB THEY DID ORIGINALLY THEY WERE MAKING SPARE PARTS FOR SOME OF OUR GUN TURRETS AND FOUND THAT HE WAS A MAN WHO COULD DESIGN WHAT THEY WANTED AND THEY GOT HIM THEY HAD HUNTED HIM AND WHEN HE LEFT I WASN'T TOO HAPPY WITH A PERSON WHO GOT THE JOB AND I THOUGHT I WANT TO MOVE BUT I HAD TO WORK QUITE HARD TO GET INTO THE WRENS BECAUSE OF COURSE I WAS IN A RESERVED OPTION I WAS GOING TO ASK WAS IT I ASSUMED IT WAS A RESERVED OCCUPATION SO YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCEDURE TO GET OUT AND THERE WERE THE WRENS WEREN'T OPEN FOR RECRUITMENT ANYHOW AT THAT TIME WE WERE BEING DRAWN I SUPPOSE IS THE WORD FOR BY WAR ARTIST A MAN CALLED LEOPOLD FREEDMAN I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO RUN TO EARTH SINCE I'VE TRIED BECAUSE HE DID LIKE A MURAL OF PEOPLE WORKING IN THE FACTORY AND IT WENT TO THE NATIONAL WHAT'S THE ONE IN TRAFALGAR NASAL ART GALLERY IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE I WAS SITTING WHILE HE WAS DRAWING ME AND TALKING TO HIM AND I SAID I WANTED TO JOIN THE WRENS AND THE PROBLEM WAS THERE WERE NO VACANCIES AND I WAS IN THE RESERVED OCCUPY SO HE GAVE ME THE NAME OF A WOMAN AGAIN I'D FORGOTTEN HER NAME BUT SHE WAS THE HEAD OF THE MINISTRY OF LABOR IN LONDON SO I'D GO OFF TO LONDON TO SEE THIS WOMAN AND SHE SHE TOLD ME SORT OF INSIDE SECRET THAT I OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN FAIRLY SOON BECAUSE THE WRENS WERE EXPANDING AND THEY EXPANDED VERY RAPIDLY AND I GOT IN VERY EASILY THEN BUT I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THE DOOR WAS OPEN BECAUSE THE LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY DIDN'T WANT WOMEN RELUCTANTLY TOOK THEM IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR BUT IT WAS A MAN'S SERVICE IT WASN'T FOR WOMEN BRILLIANT WHAT WAS THE PROCESS THEN FROM TRANSITIONING FROM BEING A SECRETARY IN TO BECOMING A WREN WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF IT I REMEMBER HAVING MY PAPERS BEING SENT TO LEADS BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY SUDDENLY EXPANDED THEY HAD TO OPEN NEW TRAINING DEPOTS I WAS IN MY EARLY TWENTIES AND I HAD WHAT THEY CALL A WHITE PAPER WHICH WAS A RECOMMENDATION FOR A COMMISSION AS SOON AS YOU WERE INTERVIEWED ORIGINALLY YOU KNOW MOST GIRLS HAVE TO WAIT AND WORK A WHILE BUT I WAS OLDER AND I THINK THEY SAW ME AS A POSSIBLE ADMIN OFFICER WELL THEY DID ACTUALLY BUT THEN I WENT FROM LEADS AFTER I DID MY BASIC TRAINING ROCHESTER WHICH IS REALLY THE CHATHAM NOW I HAD SEEN MYSELF HIS BOATS CREW YOU KNOW AND BECAUSE I WAS A BRISTOLIAN I WANTED TO GO TO PLYMOUTH WHICH BUT THE NAVY HAD OTHER IDEAS SO THEY SENT ME TO TO GO TO TRAINING FOR AN ADMIN OFFICER AT CHATHAM REALLY ANYHOW THEY PUT ME IN WHAT'S CALLED THE REGULATING OFFICE WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHERE YOU MONITOR PEOPLE COMING IN AND GOING OUT AND TELEPHONES I ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT THE FIRST OFFICER WHO WAS THE ONE IN CHARGE WAS A VERY VERY ENJOYABLE WOMAN AND SHE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY CALLED LADY BURTON SHAW WHO LIVED IN HOVE AND EVERY SATURDAY AFTERNOON LADY BURTON SHAW WOULD RING UP HER DAUGHTER JUST FOR A CHAT AND I WAS PUT ON THE TELEPHONE WELL I'D NEVER WORKED THOSE PLUGGED TELEPHONES I NEVER WORKED ONE OF THOSE AND OF COURSE LADY BURTON SHAW COMES THROUGH AND I WAS A PANIC I WASN'T VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT IT AND OF COURSE WHAT DID I DO IN A VERY CONVERSATION I PULLED THE PLUG OUT YOU SEE SO I HAD TO GO IN SHE CALLED ME IN AND SHE SAID WHO ON THE TELEPHONE SO I SAID IT WAS ME MA'AM YOU AREN'T NOTHING BUT A BROKEN REED AND I THOUGHT WELL NOBODY HAS EVER CALLED ME A BROKEN REED BEFORE BUT YOU KNOW IT DID ME THE WORLD OF GOOD I THOUGHT I WAS GOD'S GIFT TO THE NAVY YOU SEE AND I WASN'T A THAT REMARK REALLY HAS STUCK WITH ME ALL MY LIFE WILL YOU EXCUSE ME FOR ONE WERE YOU AT CHATHAM RATING SO DO YOU KNOW WHAT I SUPPOSE I WAS NOR COMMANDER IT WAS DID YOU GO TO CHATHAM WELL ONLY TO VISIT BECAUSE WE WERE BILLETED IN ROCHESTER AND BECAUSE I WAS DOING THE ADMIN WORK IN THE OFFICE THE OFFICE WAS ATTACHED TO THE BILLET YOU FIND MOVING AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE YOU BEEN OUT OF BRISTOL AT THIS POINT NOT VERY FAR NO THAT WAS ANOTHER THING YOU DIDN'T TRAVEL FAR YOU KNOW HOLIDAYS WELL THE FURTHEST WE WENT WAS TENBY IN SOUTH WALES BUT I HAD BEEN TO LONDON AND I HAD BEEN TO FRANCE ON A SCHOOL TRIP ONCE BUT NOT VERY FAR WE WEREN'T VERY WELL OFF ANYHOW AS A FAMILY YOU KNOW WE HAD TO CUT OUR CORNERS ROCHESTER THEN WHERE DID YOU WHERE DID YOU GO THEN WELL WHEN I WAS AT ROCHESTER THE FIRST OFFICER WAS TELLING YOU CALLED ME A BROKEN READ I WAS IN THE WHAT DO THEY CALL IT NOW THE OFFICE WHICH ALLOCATED POSTINGS TO THE GIRL BECAUSE ALL THE GIRLS THERE WERE WAITING TO BE SENT SOMEWHERE AND I WAS THERE AND NOTHING CAME IN BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CAME IN FROM THE ADMIRALTY AND NOTHING CAME IN I WAS INTERESTED IN I WAS DOWN FOR ADMIN AND THEN I FOUND THAT TO DO ADMIN I HAD TO GO TO LOWESTOFT TO THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE WHERE THEY TRAINED ADMIN OFFICERS AND I FOUND THAT THERE WAS A LONG WAITING LIST AND I THOUGH WELL I DIDN'T JOIN THE NAVY TO SIT IN AN OFFICE AND WAIT FOR THAT SO I WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO AND I SAID NO SO THEY SAID WELL YOU REALIZE YOU'LL GO TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST I SAID WELL I DIDN'T JOIN TO HAVE A COMMISSION ANYHOW YOU KNOW I JOIN YOU AND DO A JOB SO SHE SAID TO ME IF YOU SEE ANYTHING COMING THROUGH IT WAS A TELE PRINTER IN THOSE DAYS LET ME KNOW AND I'LL SEE I SAID WELL ALL I KNOW IS I DON'T WANT TO WORK IN LONDON I DON'T MIND WHERE ELSE I GO YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO STICK WITH MY SHORTHAND AND OF GENERAL OFFICE WORK SHE SAID IT COMES AT THE TIME WHEN GENERAL EISENHOWER WAS TO BE QUITE WELL KNOWN AS A COMMANDER AND HE SET OFF IF YOU REMEMBER SHAPE AND I LOOKED AT SOMETHING CAME IN WITH C STROKE SHAPE AND I THOUGHT WELL THAT'S INTERESTING THE WAS THE ALLIED NAVAL COMMANDER EXPEDITIONARY FORCE AND THAT WAS ADMIRAL RAMSEY AND I THOUGHT THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING YOU KNOW SO I WON'T LIE COULD I HAVE MY NAME PUT UP FOR THAT VACANCY AND SO SHE AGREED AND YOU HAD TO TAKE THE CHANCE WHAT OTHER APPLICACIANS THEY HAD AND I GOT IT I SAID WHERE IS IT SO SHE SAID WELL TO START WITH YOU'LL HAVE TO GO TO NORFOLK SQUARE IN LONDON WHICH IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF SHAPE AND THE GROUP WERE COLLECTING THERE AND THEY WERE MOSTLY WRENS WHO WERE GOING TO DO THE DAY PLANNING BUT I GOT IT BECAUSE I'D PUT IN FOR A STROKE SHAPE I GOT ATTACHED TO THIS IS WHERE ADMIRAL PARRY CAME IN TO ADMIRAL PARRY WHO TYPICALLY BRITISH WE HADN'T STARTED D DAY BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS ALREADY POST OPERATIVE PLANNING AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE THIS I THOUGHT WE HADN'T WON THE WAR WHY ARE THEY PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE YOU SEE AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS CAUGHT UP IN THAT FROM THEN ON I WAS ATTACHED TO HIM AND SENT TO BUSHY PARK IN HERTFORDSHIRE FORD SHIRE IT'S NEAR HAMPTON COURT PALACE AND IT WAS GENERALIZING HOUSE AT HEADQUARTERS THEY WERE COLLECTING ALL THE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE PEOPLE THERE WELL THE TROOPS WERE BEING COLLECTED AROUND KENTON SUSSEX AND PLACE SORRY IT'S MY NERVES YOU REALLY KNOW AS ME DON'T WE AND I DON'T WANT TO GO TO LONDON BUT ANYHOW IN THE END THEY SAID WELL YOU'LL ONLY BE HELD THERE UNTIL AND I WAS ONLY HELD THERE A DAY I REMEMBER SITTING ON THE WALL OUTSIDE NORFOLK HOUSE WHICH IS WHERE THE LONDON GROUP WERE TOLD TO WAIT AND SOMEBODY WOULD PICK ME UP BECAUSE THEN ON IT BECAME HIGHLY SECRETIVE I WAS SITTING LIKE A LONELY WREN WAS MY NAVAL CASE THAT NOTHING A JEEP CAME ZOOMING ROUND SQUARE AND AN AMERICAN STOP BY ME ANYWAY SO YOU RAY AND IN BALMY GO AND A BUSHY PARK WELL I SAID I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING I'VE JUST BEEN TOLD TO SIT ON THIS WAR SO HE SAID HE GOT ME ABOARD HIS JEEP AND WE WENT THROUGH THAT IT WASN'T FAR FROM NORFOLK TO GET OUT OF LONDON WENT TO BUSHY PARK THAT WAS A FUNNY AND OF COURSE WHEN I GET TO BUSHY PARK I'M THE ONLY WREN THERE BECAUSE IT WAS A SEPARATE UNIT TO THE BIG GROUP THAT WERE AT NORFOLK HOUSE WHAT YEAR WAS THERE FORTY FOUR FORTY FOUR FORTY FIVE HAVE YOU JUST DESCRIBED THE SET UP AT BUSHY PARK AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE BEFORE D DAY WELL BUSHY PARK I PRESUME IT'S A SORT OF LOCAL IT WAS A VERY LARGE PARK AND IN IT WERE PORTER CABINS IN WHICH BY THEN YOU'D GOT THE BRITISH AND THE FRENCH AMERICANS WHO WERE THE FOURTH ONES AS CANADIANS YES WELL THERE WERE A FEW BUT NOT MANY I WAS THINKING OF THE GROUP THEY SPLIT GERMANY UP INTO REGIONS DIDN'T THEY THERE WAS THE BRITISH RUSSIAN RUSSIAN BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER RUSSIANS BEING AT BUSHY PARK THEY LINKED UP LATER BUT I REMEMBER BEING IN ONE OF THESE WE HAD OUR OFFICE AND THIS IS WHERE I DIDN'T I COULDN'T SAY I MET HIM BUT THE DOODLE BUGS STARTED FLYING AND THEY GOT THEY HAD BUSHY PARK IN THEIR SIGHTS AND THEY GOT VERY NEAR US THERE WERE AIR RAID SHELTERS BUILT SPECIALLY AND A LOT OF THE AMERICANS PARTICULARLY THE WOMEN IN THE AMERICAN ARMY HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE AND THEY JUST WENT TO PIECES IF THERE WAS AN AIR RAID THEY WERE TERRIBLY NERVOUS LOT BUT I QUITE ENJOYED BEING WITH THEM BECAUSE IT WAS A DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE ALTOGETHER THEIR METHOD OF EATING THE EQUIPMENT THEY GAVE US THE HYGIENE THAT WAS PUT IN I WAS I WAS UNDER U S VISION AND SOMEBODY CALLED LADY BRECKNOCK I THINK SHE BECAME QUITE A POWER IN THE LAND AFTERWARDS FROM A POLITICAL POINT OF VIEW BUT SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF US AND I RESENTED HER BECAUSE SHE USED TO OPEN MY POST WHICH OF COURSE THE NAVY NEVER OPENED YOUR POST OF COURSE BECAUSE I WAS UNDER S RULE ALL OUR POST WAS OPENED LADY BRETLOCK ALWAYS MADE A POINT OF READING AND REMEMBERING WHAT WAS IN AND I WAS ALWAYS SENDING HOME FOR MONEY AND WAS ALWAYS SAYING YOU KNOW YOU DON'T NEED MONEY YOU'VE GOT PLENTY EVEN THOUGH YOU SHOULD MANAGE ON WHAT YOU'VE GOT THAT WAS SEVEN AND SIX WEEKS FROM THERE DID YOU MEET IZENHA WELL YES NO I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE DOODLE BUG IF HE WAS ON SIGHT IN HIS OFFICE HE DIDN'T COME VERY OFTEN BECAUSE OF COURSE HIS RESPONSIBILITY WAS ENORMOUS THE PLACES YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAID EISENHOWER WAS THERE BUT THEY WERE NEVER THERE FOR LONG BUT HE DID USE THE AIR RAID SHELTER WHICH WAS THE SAME SHELTER THAT WE USED BECAUSE WE WERE IN ADJOINING OFFICES YOU KNOW HE HARDLY SAW US BECAUSE HE POPPED DOWN AND ALL HIS ONTARAGE WOULD BE WITH HIM BUT I MEAN TO SAY WE DIDN'T FEEL WE WERE LESSER THAN HIM HE ALWAYS HAD A WORD TO SAY BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY SAY YOU MET HIM YOU KNOW WHEN DID OR PARRY COME INTO THE SEA NOT ACTUALLY UNTIL I WENT ACROSS FRANCE BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME ONE OF HIS SIDEKICKS WAS A CAPTAIN ON BEEN THE PORTUGUESE IT WASN'T AN ATTACHE THE NAVAL REPRESENTATIVE IN LISBON SO WHEN HE JOINED US ON THE STAFF OF ADMIRAL PARRY I WAS ATTACHED TO HIM HE ALWAYS CALLED ME HIS MANNA DO YOU KNOW I NEVER ACTUALLY SPOKEN TO A PORTUGUESE TO FIND OUT I WAS TOLD IT MEANT FRIEND BUT I WAS ALWAYS HE ALWAYS TOLD PEOPLE IF THEY WANTED SOMETHING GO AND ASK MY MAINA HE WAS A VERY GENTLE VERY NICE MAN ABOUT WHOM I KNEW NEVER HEARD MUCH ABOUT HIM AT ALL I KNOW ADMIRAL PARRY AT THE END OF THE WAR I THINK HE WAS AN APPLE GROWER IN KENT THAT'S HIS RETIREMENT THAT'S WHAT HE DID BUT CAPTAIN OWEN I NEVER KNEW WHAT DID YOU SENSE WHAT DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS ESCALATION TO WARDS D DAY HOW SORT OF TO IT WERE YOU ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE ALTHOUGH I WASN'T IN THE TYPING POOL AS IT WAS I KNEW I'D SEEN PAPERS GOING THROUGH YOU KNEW WHAT THE PLANNING WAS AND YOU SAY IT WAS TOP SECRET JUST DESCRIBE THE SECRECY PROCESS WHAT DID YOU HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO NOTE WELL IT WAS A BIGOT WAS THE THIRD LEVEL WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY DON'T THINK WE COULD EVER GET THROUGH THERE WERE SPECIAL LINES AND THINGS ON THE TELEPHONE AND IT WAS MOSTLY FOR USE BY TELEPHONE BUT I NEVER REALLY KNEW HOW THEY DECIDED I KNEW WHEN I HAD IF I HAD TO MAKE A CALL WHICH LINE I HAD TO USE WHETHER IT WAS THE ORDINARY ONE THE TOP SECRET OR BIGGER BUT I NEVER KNEW WHEN SAY CAPTAIN OWEN WAS WANTING ME TO DO SOMETHING AND HE SAID THAT 'LL BE BIGGER HOW HE KNEW IT HAD TO BE BIGGER THAT WAS SOMETHING KNOWN TO HIM ABOVE TOP SEA YES JUST DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR JOB WAS THEN WHAT WERE YOU ACTUALLY DOING PREDOMINANT WAS IN LONDON AS WELL MAINLY DOING THE ADMIRALS OR CAPTAIN WHICHEVER ONE WAS AROUND DOING THEIR POST AND TAKING DICTATION AND WHAT PLANNING THEY HAD TO DO IN TERMS OF POST OFFICE MOST OF THE POST OPERATIVE STUFF WAS THE DIVISION OF THE GERMAN NAVY WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER YOU KNOW WHO WAS GOING TO HAVE WHAT AND THAT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE OF COURSE THE RUSSIANS WANTED EVERYTHING THIS WAS MUCH FURTHER ON WHEN WE WERE IN BERLIN BUT THE RUSSIANS ALWAYS WANTED ALL THE BIG STUFF YOU KNOW WE KNEW ALL THE BEST EQUIPMENT WAS IN THE SMALLER DESTROYERS AND THINGS SO WE WENT FOR THOSE SO THEY WERE WORKING OUT ALL THOSE SORT OF THINGS OF COURSE WE ALL HAD TO GO UP THROUGH THE ADMIRALTY AND BACK AGAIN SO IT ALL TOOK TIME IT WAS JUST STRAIGHT FORWARD SO REPORTING THE POST OPERATIVE PLANNING EVEN BEFORE D DAY DID DID YOU EVER MEET WERE THERE ANY OTHER LIKE CHURCHILL ANY OF THE OTHER BIG WIGS BIG EVER SAW CHURCHILL MONTGOMERY WHEN WE WERE IN GERMANY IT WAS THE FASHION TO HAVE A DOG I NEVER HAD ONE BUT MY FRIEND HAD ONE WHICH HE CALLED FRAT BECAUSE THAT OF COURSE WAS NO FRATILIZATION I REMEMBER WE HAD AN OFFICE WE WERE IN FRANKFORT AT THE TIME THE OFFICE THERE HAD A SORT OF STAIRCASE GOING UP AND PADDY ALWAYS TOOK FRAT TO WORK WITH NOBODY MIND BECAUSE THE WAR WAS OVER BY THEN AND WE WERE GOING UP STAIRS ONE DAY AND SOMEBODY SAID WATCH OUT MRS COMING HE WAS IN THE BUILDING AT SOME MEETING AND HE WAS COMING AGAIN WITH HIS ONTO DOWNSTAIRS AS WE WERE GOING UP YOU SEE APPARENTLY HE DIDN'T DO IT IN FRONT OF US BUT WHEN HE GOT BACK TO HIS OFFICE HE TOLD HIS ADJUTANT TO CONTACT WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WRENS TO SAY THAT HE DIDN'T WANT DOGS IN THE BUILDING IT WAS DIFFICULT SO IF YOU WERE VERY PRIVY TO ALL THIS STUFF WHEN DID YOU KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BE JUNE FIFTH OR SIXTH DID YOU KNOW THEM WELL YES BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE DELAY YOU MEAN BECAUSE OF THE DELAY YOU KNOW YES BUT YOU KNEW THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE THE DAY THAT THE LANDINGS WERE HAPPENING DID YOU EVER WELL IT WAS YOU DID AND YOU DIDN'T KNOW THERE WERE ALWAYS THINGS BEING SAID TO PUT YOU OFF SO YOU WEREN'T A HUNDRED PERCENT SHORE BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE ANYBODY WAS REALLY BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER AND THINGS BUT WE WERE WHEN I WAS AT CHATHAM AND THERE WAS YOU KNOW WE'D DONE ALL THE WORK WE HAD TO DO AND WE WERE WAITING WE WERE SENT TO CHERRY PICKING ORCHARDS AND THAT WAS AMAZING BECAUSE ALL THE LANES ROADS ALL ROUND OF KENT SORT OF AREA GOING DOWN TO THE COAST WAS FULL OF ARMY VEHICLES AND MEN WAITING AND YOU KNEW THAT THEY WERE THERE READY TO GO BUT I THINK THAT'S HOW I LEARNED RATHER THAN THROUGH THE OFFICE AFTER BUSHY PARK YOU WENT BACK TO CHATHAM DID YOU WANT BACK OVER IT BUSH I'VE GOT TO GET THIS BECAUSE I DETERMINED TO NO FROM BUSHY PARK WE WERE MOVED BACK TO LONDON I WORKED IN PRINCES GARDENS THERE AND WE LIVED IN ENGLAND'S LANE ENGLAND'S LANE IS A SORT OF SWISS COTTAGE WAY AND THERE WAS A NURSES HOME THERE I THINK IT WAS A CHERRY CROSS NURSES HOME THEY USED THAT FOR A WREN BILLET WE USED TO TRAVEL TRAVELLED TO UM GARDENS FROM THERE AND IT WAS FROM PRINCES GARDENS THAT I WAS DRAFTED OVER TO FRANCE CAN YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU FELT WHEN YOU FOUND OUT YOU BEGAN FOLLOWING THE EXPEDITION BUT I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I FELT THAT I AM STILL THAT MY NAVAL LIFE WAS ANYTHING BUT NAVY YOU KNOW THE BECAUSE I HAD GREAT IDEAS OF BEING BOAT CREW AS I SAID GOING TO SEA WITH THE MAIL WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE INLAND AS IT WERE BUT ONCE I GOT USED TO IT AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN ADVENTURE AS WELL IN GOING OVER DID YOU SAIL TO FRANCE WE WENT OVER YOU KNOW THERE WAS THE TROOPS OVER WE WENT BECAUSE ACTUALLY WHEN IT CAME TO IT THE WAR THAT THE ARMY WAS ALMOST IN BERLIN BY THEN SO THEY FELT IT WAS SAFE TO PUT THE GIRLS OVER WE WENT ACROSS TO A LITTLE TOWN IN NORMANDY CALLED GRAVEL ON THE WERE DUCKS WE CALLED THEM YOU KNOW THOSE LIKE LANDING CRAFT AND I WAS TERRIBLY SICK I SAY IT PROVED TO ME I WASN'T A SAILOR THERE WERE THE OF THE DAY THAT YOU WENT ON THE LANDING CRUST TO FRANCE GOING BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THE STORY AND WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF YOU KNOW THAT DAY WHERE DID YOU SAIL FROM AND WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LIKE ANY CAN YOU REMEMBER THE WEATHER WASN'T TOO GOOD HENCE THE FACT THAT OBVIOUS I SUPPOSE I THINK THERE WERE PROBABLY NEARLY BETWEEN FIFTY AND HUNDRED OF US GOING NOT ONLY WRENS BUT OTHER WE WENT FROM ONE OF THE LITTLE PORTS THEY WEREN'T REALLY PORTS THAT WERE AROUND THE BLE RIVER THAT WAY WE WERE EXCITED WE DID YOU HAD ALL SORTS OF IMAGINATIONS OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN CROSSING THE CHANNEL THAT MIGHT THINK WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO SWIM FAR ENOUGH AND THE WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WATER WHEN WE GOT THE OTHER SIDE LIKE YOU SEE THE MEN ARE NO TRAILING OUT WITH ALL THEIR STUFF THROUGH WATER THEY MANAGED TO BEACH US SO WE WERE QUITE DRY WHEN WE GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE YOU KNOW THE FRENCH ACTUALLY IN NORMANDY WERE VERY ACCOMMODATING THEY WERE VERY PLEASED TO SEE US THEY WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN MY VIEW TO THE ONES WE MET IN PARIS WAS IT OBVIOUSLY WAR TORN YES YOU KNOW BECAUSE IT WOULD BE AFTER D DAY OF COURSE WE WEREN'T ACROSS SO THINGS WERE STILL PRETTY BROKEN ALL THE SORT OF FRONT LINE HOUSES AND THINGS WERE ALL BASHED ABOUT BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN BOMBARDED OF COURSE FROM THE SEA AND GRANVILLE WHAT WAS THE SET UP THERE AND YOU'RE STILL IN A WAR WAR ZONE BASICALLY AREN'T YOU IT WAS A WAR ZONE WELL IT WAS JUST A SORT OF GETTING OFF POINT FOR MOVING PEOPLE ON BEHIND THE ARMY I THINK IT WAS FELT TO BE A REASONABLE PLACE TO START MOVING BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF EQUIPMENT AS WELL WE DIDN'T BUT THE ARMY THE AIR FORCE AND THE NAVY FOR THAT MATTER THEY ALL HAD EQUIPMENT TO MOVE UP WITH US AND I THINK GRANVILLE PROBABLY AT A LITTLE TOWN WAS CONSIDERED YOU KNOW THEY HAD GOOD ROAD NOT GOOD BUT THE TRANSPORT SITUATION MOVING STUFF WAS REASONABLE BUT VERY BASIC LIVING CONDITIONS YOU KNOW WE HAD NO RUNNING WATER OR WE HAD SORT OF THINGS LIKE YOUR TRIPOD WITH CANVAS BAGS IN THEM WHICH WERE USELESS WASHING MACHINE WELL FOR WASHING WHAT US WAS THERE IT WAS LIKE CAMPING REALLY FROM A LIVING POINT OF VIEW AND VERY LITTLE WORK WE HAD AT THAT TIME WERE YOU JUST WRITING OR DID YOU HAVE TELLY PRINTERS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT WAS THERE ANY TECHNOLOGY OH YES THERE WAS A LOT BUT NOT IN THE GROUP I WAS WITH DON'T ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE TO GO OVER WITH THE COMMUNICATORS THE TELEPHONE OPERATORS AND SO ON AND OF COURSE THEY WERE STILL THE ENGINEERS WERE STILL FITTING UP FIELD EQUIPMENT WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND THERE WERE A LOT OF WRENS IN THAT GROUP TREMENDOUS LUMBER FROM GRAVEL YOU KNOW THEY FOUND THAT THE WORK THEY WANTED ME TO DO WAS MORE CENTERED BACK IN LONDON SO I WAS SHIP BACK THAN LONDON TO WAIT UNTIL THEY'D PREPARED WHAT WE NEEDED I HAD TO HELP DO THAT AND WE WENT THEN TO PARIS BUT I WENT FROM LONDON FROM ENGLAND'S LANE THAT WAS TO PARIS ON MY OWN AND THEN I REALLY WAS I'D NOT BEEN ANYWHERE ON MY OWN BEFORE I WAS MET WHEN I GOT TO THE GARDENER BECAUSE I WENT OVER ON THE TRAIN BY ANOTHER WREN WHO'D BEEN OVER AND THEN I WAS BILLETED AND WORKED IN A CHATEAU IN IT'S A SUBURB OF PARIS ANYHOW I WORKED THERE FOR A VERY SHORT TIME AND THEN THE ADMINISTRATIVE GROUP WERE FOLLOWING ON BEHIND THE ARMY AND WE WENT FROM PARIS TO FRANKFORT I DIDN'T ENJOY FRANKFORT VERY MUCH BECAUSE THERE WASN'T MUCH TO DO BY NOW MOST OF THE PLANNING HAD BEEN DONE LIFE BECAME RATHER SORT OF THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ANY POINT IN WHAT WE WERE DOING WE'D DONE IT ALL IT WAS A BIT OF A PLAYGROUND WAS THIS AT THE END OF IT WAS THIS AFTER THE WAR YES LOUDEST UM THAT HAD ENTERED BERLIN WE WERE BACK IN PARIS SO IT WAS JUST AS THE WAR WAS ENDING THE FIRST YES IT HAD ENDED BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME IN PARIS WERE THE FASHION WAS MOST BEAUTIFUL HATS MADE OUT OF CELLOPHANE PAPER YOU KNOW SWEET PAPERS AND THINGS THE WOMEN HAD MADE THEY SEEMED UNTOUCHED BY THE WAR IN PARIS MUCH LIKE US I DON'T THINK I THINK THE GERMANS HAD GIVEN THEM QUITE A GOOD TIME YOU WERE ADMIRAL PARRY THEN AT THIS POINT NO I MET ADMIRAL PARRY WHEN I GOT TO PARIS WITHDRAWING AS A PERSON VERY QUIET YOU DIDN'T REALLY FEEL HE COULD HIT ANYBODY COULD KILL ANYBODY BUT OR EVEN DISCIPLINE ANYBODY HE WAS ALWAYS VERY GENTLE AND VERY NICE TO WORK FOR BUT VERY CLEVER OF COURSE HE KNEW WHAT HE WANTED JUST DESCRIBE OF WORKING RELATIONSHIP WHAT YOU DID FOR HIM AND THE PURPOSE OF YOUR BEING THERE WAS A YOU SEE MOST OF THE HE REALLY WOULD HAVE COMMUNICATED CAPTAIN OWING MOST OF WHAT HE WANTED BECAUSE HE'D BE OFF DOING SOMETHING ELSE BUT SO THAT CAPTAIN OWEN WAS REALLY THE PERSON WHO WAS GIVING ME WORK WHEN THERE WAS WORK TO BE DONE BUT ADMIRAL PARRY CERTAINLY WAS VERY APPROACHABLE AND HE MIXED WITH US THERE WAS NO SORT OF OFFICERS AND OTHERS EVERYBODY MIXED AND HE 'S A DIFFICULT MAN TO DESCRIBE REALLY THAT YOU NICELY DESCRIBED DOWN THERE WHEN WE WERE IN BERLIN DO YOU KNOW BERLIN AT ALL IN THE LAKES THE VANS THE LAKES THAT ARE ON THE OUTSKIRTS WHEN WE WERE LIVING IN WHAT HAD BEEN THE JAPANESE EMBASSY IN BERLIN THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HOUSE IT WAS IN THAT DISTRICT WHERE THE LAKES WERE BUT I ALWAYS SAID THE VANS LAKES THEY WOULD FREEZE OVER IN THE WINTER BECAUSE WE HAD A WINTER THERE THE ADMIRAL WOULD ARRANGE SCATING PARTIES AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE THE ICE THERE SO THICK BECAUSE IT WAS SO COLD YOU COULD HAVE BARBECUES ON THE ICE THAT'S WHERE LIFE BECAME A BIT SUPERFICIAL LATTERLY WHEN THERE WASN'T MUCH WORK TO DO YOU KNOW YOU REALLY FELT YOU SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE DOING SOME WORK DID YOU GET FROM PARIS INTO FRANKFORT THEN ARE ON RAILWAYS WERE YOU IN VEHICLES OR NAVAL JEEPS MOST OF THE TRAVELLING WAS IT THE ONLY THING WHEN I WENT FROM FRANKFORT TO BERLIN I HAD BEEN HOME ON LEAVE WHEN I GOT BACK IT WAS TO FIND THAT BUT THEY COULDN'T NOTIFY ME THEY COULDN'T GET HOLD OF ME TO LET ME KNOW THAT THE MAIN PARTY HAD GONE ON TO BERLIN AND WHEN I GOT BACK TO FRANKFORT I HAD TO GO AND REPORT TO ONE OF THE ARMY OFFICERS TO GET TRANSPORT AND WHEN I GOT THERE I FOUND A MESSAGE TO SAY THAT GENERAL EISENHOWER'S HE HAD MARRIED ONE OF OUR WRENS I KNEW THEY WERE VERY FRIENDLY BEFORE I WENT AND HE LET THEM HAVE HIS HOUSE IN NEAR FRANKFORT FOR THEIR HONEYMOON AND THEY WERE BOTH DUE BACK IN BERLIN AND THEY WOULD GIVE ME A LIFT SO I WENT BREEZING UP THE AUTO BAN FROM FRANKFORT TO BERLIN AND GENERALIZED HOUSE CAR AND WHAT WAS BURNING LIKE WHAT WAS POST WAR BURNING ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED THAT REALLY DID SHAKE ME WHEN I SAW IT THERE WAS ALMOST EVERY BUILDING WE SAW WAS DESTROYED THERE WERE THESE AND THEY WEREN'T NECESSARILY OLD WOMEN BUT THEY LOOKED OLD BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL HUNCHED UP IN DARK CLOTHES WITH WHEELBARROWS CLEARING THE STREETS AND WORKING SO HARD AND LITTLE FOOD THEY WERE WORKING WITH VERY LITTLE STRENGTH I MUST GIVE THE GERMAN THE DE THEY DID WORK HARD TO GET BERLIN BACK DID YOU GO TO THE BRANDON BONGA OR THE BOTHELL ME ABOUT SOME OF THAT WELL THAT AGAIN WAS MORE LIKE A TOURIST TRIP YOU I'D BEEN TRYING TO THINK WHAT OUR OFFICE IN BERLIN WAS LIKE DON'T YOU BY THEN OF COURSE IT WAS THE CONTROL COMMISSION AND I CAN'T VISUALIZE IT AT ALL IT'S AN ABSOLUTE BLANK IN MY MEMORY I CAN REMEMBER THE REAR THE JAPANESE EMBASSY AND I CAN REMEMBER GOING ON THE TRAM FROM THERE TO THE OFFICE BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OFFICE AT ALL AND BECAUSE I WAS THERE FOR NEARLY A YEAR BUT WE WENT TO SEE THE BUNKER WHERE HITLER WAS KILLED AND THAT WAS STILL IN PRETTY ROUGH STATE YOU KNOW BITS OF FURNITURE WERE STILL THERE HADN'T BEEN TIED UP WHAT WAS YOUR SENTIMENT TOWARD THE GERMANS AT THE TIME WELL IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE THEM VERY HELPFUL BUT THEN YOU KNOW I QUITE LIKED THEM BUT OF COURSE THEY HAD A LOT TO GAIN FROM US IN THE WAY OF FOOD AND SO ON THE RUSSIANS OF COURSE WERE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THE STORY GOES THAT THE RUSSIAN ARMY THAT TOOK BERLIN THEY PULLED THEM BACK THEY REPLACED THEM WITH A SORT OF THIRD LINE WHO WERE MONGOLIANS THEY WERE PRETTY ROUGH ON ONE OCCASION COMING HOME FROM THE OFFICE A COUPLE THEY USED TO DRINK AN AWFUL LOT OF ANY BOOTS THAT OF COUPLE OF VERY DRUNK RUSSIANS STARTED WE WERE WALKING HOME FROM THE OFFICE IN BERLIN TO OUR DIG THEY STARTED GETTING THEIR GUNS OUT AND SHOOTING ALL OVER THE PLACE WE HAD TO JUMP IN A HEDGE AFTER THAT OUT OF THEIR WAY AND AFTER THAT THEY PUT A FAIRLY STRONG MARINE PRESENCE ON A SORT OF GUARD AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO TRAVEL ON OUR OWN SO YOU WERE PRETTY OK ON TRANSPORT IF WE GOT THE TRAM HOME IS IF YOU STARTED WALKING WE HAD GERMAN COOK IN THE WRENNERY HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO BE PLEASANT TO US BUT HE WAS BECAUSE OF COURSE HE USED TO COLLECT OUR USED TEA BAGS AND TAKE THEM HOME AND HE KNEW THAT IF HE DIDN'T YOU KNOW TREAT US ALL PROPERLY HE'D GET TAKEN OFF AND WE'D GET SOMEONE ELSE AND HE'D LOSE OUT ON HIS BITS AND PIECES HE WAS GETTING AND WE ALSO HAD AN INTERESTING MAID FRANCESCA WHO WAS GERMAN AT ALL JEWISH AND SHE HAD HAD A VERY BAD TIME SHE HAD LEGITIMATELY BECAUSE WELL I SAY YOU LEGITIMATELY IT WAS HER BOYFRIEND NOT A GERMAN OR A RUSSIAN PREGNANT AND SHE HAD THIS BABY IN A CELLAR WHICH SHE WAS HIDING FROM BECAUSE THE GERMANS WERE STILL LOOKING FOR JEWS EVEN AFTER THE WAR AND ANYHOW IT WAS A RUSSIAN SOLDIER WHO ACTUALLY HELPED HER HAVE HER BABY IN THE CELLAR AND YOU KNOW WHO REALLY RESCUED HER COURSE THE BRITISH WE WERE IN THE BRITISH REGION OF COURSE BUT FRANCESCA USED TO HAVE LESSONS IN GERMAN FOR US SHE WAS AN EDUCATED JEW SO YOU DIDN'T GO TO POTSDAM YES THE POTSDAM CONFERENCE WAS HELD WELL I WAS IN BERLIN ADMIRAL PARRY OF COURSE HAD A THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE POTSDAM WAS TO SORT OF FINALIZE THE BREAK UP OF THE GERMAN NAVY I WENT WITH CAPTAIN OR BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY'D DONE THEIR WORK ON THE NAVY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THAT I DID GO INTO THE ACTUAL MEETING HALL BECAUSE IT'S QUITE SMALL ACTUALLY I WAS SURPRISED I'VE BEEN BACK SINCE AND HAD ANOTHER LOOK AT IT AND I THOUGHT YES IT IS WAR BUT I WENT THIS TIME BECAUSE I WAS DRIVING AS WELL YOU KNOW SO OUR GROUP THE CAPTAIN SAID IF YOU LIKE TO GO YOU CAN GO BUT YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO GO INTO THE CONFERENCE BUT DID YOU KNOW IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT DID I DID YOU KNOW IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT IN HISTORY OH YES I KNEW THAT YOU KNOW YOU SAW STARLING AND CHURCHILL YOU KNOW IT WAS JUST AS THOUGH YOU WERE A TORIST WHAT TO HEAR BIT EARLIER ABOUT HOW THE NAVY KNEW MORE ABOUT THE GERMAN NAVY THAN THE RUSSIANS HE RUSSIANS WANTED THE CARRIERS THE BRITS WANTED THE DESTROYER WAS THERE JUST TO RECAP ON THAT WAS THERE ANY MORE OF THAT DISCUSSION OF PRE POTSDAM THAT YOU CAN RECALL OR WAS IT ALL DONE AND DUSTED BY THEN NO I DO I THINK THEY THERE WAS ANOTHER ADMIRAL MYLES WAS SOMEONE WHO APPEARED ON THE SEA BEFORE POTSDAM AND HE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH YOU KNOW SORTING OUT THE GERMAN NAVY BUT I FORGOTTEN WHAT YOUR QUESTION WAS WAS THERE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT YOU KNOW NOW WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE TWO ROCKETS WE SHOULD BE GETTING MODES RATHER THAN YOU KNOW I SAY I THINK IT WAS ALL DONE BEFORE I DON'T REMEMBER I KNOW THERE WAS REMEMBER WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN AN INCIDENT WHEN I DON'T MEAN CHURCHILL I MEAN APTLY BECAUSE IT WAS AT THE POTSDAM CONFERENCE YOU KNOW THAT CHURCHILL LOST HIS SEAT AND HATLEY CAME IN AND THAT MAN MADE A CHANGE OF FOREIGN SECRETARY IT WAS WHAT WAS HIS NAME NOW THE BIG MAN SOCIALIST WAS AT THIS FOREIGN SECRETARY AND HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE GOT CROSS OVER SOMETHING AT POTSDAM AND BANG THE TABLE IN THE WATER YOU KNOW THERE WERE GLASSES OF WATER WHICH I GATHER THE RUSSIANS DIDN'T TAKE VERY KINDLY TO THIS MAN YOU KNOW WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE HIS WAY AND BANG THE TABLE THE WORK UP UNTIL WE GOT TO BERLIN WAS REALLY QUITE INTERESTING BUT ONCE YOU KNOW THE FINAL STAMPS WERE BEING PUT ON THE DIVIDING OF THE CITY INTO REGIONS AND THINGS LIKE THE BREAK UP OF THE OF THE GERMAN NAVY THERE REALLY WASN'T MUCH INTERESTING TO DO IT DID BECOME A SORT OF ALMOST A PLAYGROUND JUST TELL ME ABOUT V J DAY IN BERLIN WHEN V J DAY WAS ANNOUNCED THEY SAID THERE WOULD BE A PARADE TOWARDS THE BRANDENBURG SO WE HAD THE DAY OFF AND WENT DOWN TO SEA IT WAS A WONDERFUL DISPLAY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS THE END OF THE WAR AND EVERYBODY WAS A BIT TIRED AND FED UP THE AMERICANS PUT ON A GREAT SHOW WITH WHAT EQUIPMENT THEY HAD AND SO DID THE RUSSIANS WERE YOU THRILLED THAT IT WAS THE END OF THE WAR WERE YOU THRILLED WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER THERE WE WERE WE WERE ALL A BIT UNCERTAIN ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN YOU KNOW THE WAR WAS OVER AND YOU KNOW THERE WAS THIS DEVASTATED CITY HOW WAS IT GOING TO RECOVER AND YOU KNOW WHO WAS GOING TO SEE THE GERMANS BEHAVE THEMSELVES WITH LITTLE RECOGNITION THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE REALLY THE PROBLEM IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE BECAUSE THAT WAS IN STARLINGS DAY OF COURSE IT WAS LIKE GOING ANY GROUP JUST GOING OUT TO SEE A PARADE YOU KNOW THAT WHEN WAS YOUR DEMO AND JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT THAT I DID GO BACK TO CHATHAM TO BE MOBS YOU KNOW I SAID I WANTED TO BE MOBBED AND OF COURSE THEY WERE THEN PLANNING THE BREAK UP OF ALL THE SERVICES AND BACK TO CHATHAM JUST TO HAND OVER THINGS THAT EQUIPMENT I'D GOT THAT I HAD TO RETURN IT WAS A VERY UNEVENTFUL THING I MINDED BUT I RETURNED HOME WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND YOUR WELL THAT AGAIN WAS A BIT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO EXPLAIN BECAUSE IT WAS MAINLY FOR THE WORK THAT I DID YOU KNOW SEEING THAT CAME FROM THE PALACE JUST SAID FOR ZEAL AND DEVOTION TO DUTY WHATEVER THAT MEANS WAS WARTIME AND THERE WAS NO SORT OF GOING TO THE PALACE TO GET YOUR GOG OR ANYTHING IT JUST CAME IN THE POST A NICE IT WAS QUITE NICE TO FEEL THAT IT WAS RECOGNISED BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T MADLY INTERESTING OR MADLY RESPONSIBLE YOU FELT YOU WERE CONTRIBUTING TO WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED TO DO IN THE BEGINNING THING TO SERVE YOUR KING AND COUNTRY DOING YOUR BIT AND HOW DO YOU REFLECT ON YOUR LIFE IS A WREN THEN I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS YOU KNOW I BEGAN TO BECOME MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN BEING WITH PEOPLE RATHER THAN PAPER AS IT WERE AND HAD I WAS LOOKING AROUND FOR A JOB AND I FOUND THAT THERE WAS AN APPROVED SCHOOL WANTING A SECRETARY THEY CALLED THEM HOUSE MISTRESS IN BATH I DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN BRISTOL I DIDN'T WANT TO GO BACK TO MY OLD JOB THAT'S HOW THAT WAS MY FIRST STEP IN SOCIAL WORK AND THEN MY FATHER BECAME VERY ILL AS THE UNMARRIED DAUGHTER IN THE FAMILY I WAS EXPECTED TO BE AT HOME I WAS CONCERNED FOR BOTH OF THEM BECAUSE HE WAS A GOOD DEAL OLDER THAN ME SO I RETURNED I GAVE UP THE APPROVED SCHOOL THAT I WAS WORKING AT WHICH INCIDENTALLY THE LAST ONE WAS A PLACE CALLED DUNCROFT IN MIDDLE SIX WHICH HAD BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH JIMMY SAVILE I THOUGHT MY GOODNESS AND THEN BEFORE I LEFT DUNCROFT I HAD GOT MYSELF A JOB WITH BRISTOL CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENT THE DAYS BEFORE THE SOCIAL SERVICES AS SUCH WERE FORMED AND I STAYED WITH THEM UNTIL I RETIRED WITH GOLD YOU KNOW THAT WAS TWENTY NINE YEARS AGO DO YOU STILL THINK ABOUT THE WRENS YES THE WRENS THAT REMAINED CONSTANT BECAUSE THEY HAVE A VERY STRONG ASSOCIATION THAT'S GATHER HOW YOU RAN ME TO EARTH AND I'VE BELONGED TO A LOCAL BRANCH SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY THREE AS I JOINED SO YOU'RE STILL AS PROUD TO BE A WREN NOW AS YOU WERE WHEN YOU BECAME YEAH YEAH YEAH AS
