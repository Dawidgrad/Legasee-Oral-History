i don't how many i were people killed in the torpedo no we only we only lost two fortunately one was the deck boy and he just disappeared we don't know what happened to him he's probably blown away in the explosion and the other was the second engineer who has beds and in our boat we were very fortunate we only lost two people and now the the commodore was in his uniform but he he borrowed a jacket from somebody to put over it because if the the submarine had seen a rear admiral they would have taken him prison am sorry he was suffering along with rally body he was in our boat actually what was he like to see the u boat is a just watching well he was just circling round the cable going you know and then it was reported it must have been on german news real i suppose and am in this hessler guy did a report on it which i read on the after he was you bout as and he married a jones's niece or he was well in touch with the high command and after the war he was employed by the royal navy to write the history and now he mentioned this sinking but he said this was a cue ship and it wasn't we were not an armed naval ship to those were the first real war when the eu boats used to attack and then they were the ships would drop the sides and there be guns there and they fight back you know we were at a mason ship we had one anti submarine gun but we went one of these special ships you see but what he he may have thought as we were carrying aircraft on deck bow fighters at for the royal air force we were taking those to west africa and from there they were flown to the middle east for the north atlantic not the african battle you see so these were in the sea they were blown up to us sinking around so perhaps he thought that was the reason why but we went that your merson ship and you mention the a two life a said will you may were you able to keep with the other life raft until the storm now the the we got separated the other boat was picked up before we were actually am but you know it's very difficult when you get currents and waves and things and you say you're doing it a sailing we had a bit of a sail we put up and we have a bit hole and you get separated you see we had a radio a distressed radio in a big sort of to mantle a big thing that but that was in the boat that was in the water so it was useless and so we want ever to make any communication and we couldn't have communicated with that one in the case because they didn't have one and there was no there were no cellphones in those days and no satellites the more were there any women we didn't have any women on the ship now and what was the rear amolike does he come to see the sea was quite calm now the admiral had on board the commodore sir oh yes yes what was he like what was all his father he was quite okay but you see he he wasn't in command of the ship he was in command of the convergence and when he was in the life boat the command of our life boat was the second officer with a very good managed and good navigator and he was the one who organized things on the only and the boat and dishing out the food and things like that to you now the and indicating different jobs to different people not the admiral yeah and what did you do for things lie what did you do if you needed the lean stuff while you went over the side you just sat on but you know you didn't you you didn't have really much in the way of motion all the time because you want eating you got a little bit of stuff to eat and go to into drinks you now sir you might want to have a pea but you you know number two is it wasn't very often have a child you see and what was it like when you saw this plain coming and land and then take off again it must have been so destroyed yeah but i mean it's it it couldn't i mean it couldn't take any more people and it was it could only land on quite calm water otherwise it would be in difficulty you know it was quite helpful it was it wasn't a sunderland they they could take a lot of people but the sunderland didn't land in the open sea so that was a wonder happened about that but i mean he when when he took off we knew he knew where we were and that's why i think they sent out this a ship to try and pick us up but then with the storm we lost it another night did you see in the storm did you think you might sink well it looked a bit like it yes but a is good seaman ship by the second officer then we had a what they called a sea anchor we put out as well and the steady of the boat you know and it's for into the waves and things like that but did you have a chart to navigator was it star astro now we we had a compass we we didn't have any sections that are they all disappeared and so we didn't get we could only rely on estimated position she said but each lifeboat was fitted with a compass and we were going on that compass i mean we knew where we were when we were sunk so we knew where we had to go and we knew the approximate distance now if we'd been a bit further out in the atlantic maybe five hundred miles we would have had to go to brazil because we couldn't have could have gone against the currents and tides to west africa they were all sweeping across there and this happened to a number of life boats and people were thirty forty days in the boat and very few of them survived so we were fortunate being fairly close to the mainland of africa
