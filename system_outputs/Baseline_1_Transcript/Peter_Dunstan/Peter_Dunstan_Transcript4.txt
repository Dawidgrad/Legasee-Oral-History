the next big thing you did was you took churchill to america yeah what was what did you know about i mean i take it you weren't told what we got churchill coming on next wednesday what was it like how did you find out what you were doing a there was there was virtually no no information passed the fact that a mister churchill the prime minister is being is coming aboard were taking him to america and that was it and he used to he used to wander down the down the mesteks and he came along and you you find you sitting there a next to him talking to him and then he beatle off and he got around somewhere else he wandered all round the ship but team he was quite a great character the thing was the thing that i do remember about that was that the we were to meet the americans in archangel bay in canada and the yanks had placed a dirty great big red boy where they wanted to the prince of wales to anchor and two great satisfaction of the role of the role navy a the as we come up alongside the this dirty great big red boy the officer of the watch ordered the anchor to be released and he dropped straight on top of this dirty great big red boy sort of two fingers up to the americans you want us there we are there on top of it and that was that was the main thing that i remember about that the course so i can't remember what day it was but i know that on the sunday there was a church service aboard the prince wales when roosevelt came aboard the prince wales and churchill a and we had the church service and i've got somewhere among my records a photograph taken and i was right at the very back against the against the rail a at the service but i've got a photograph somewhere taken that day can you remember any of the conversations you have with sir said a coach now forty fifty sixty so sixty seventy so was seventy years my apologies sir and one thing i was curious about is you know you've alviously had a major engagement it's forty one and you're off to america it looks like they're coming in couldn't you remember much about what what the sense of war was like what it was like now at this point against it you knew it was a major warren no i mean we we were engaged i was engaged in the gunnery side and the machine shop you you thought about that you didn't see you you didn't think about and you were serving the country and you just a just carried on i mean you had no no political thoughts whatsoever as far as i can remember the ones journey to america with churchill and on the return did you encounter any you know you boats action mountainous seas and the one thing that i do remember was that on the way back we came across a british convoy a coming from america to england and the prince was steamed right through the middle of the convoy showing the flag and there was churchill on the on the stern of the prince of wales waving like may at the ships as we went past but that's that's the only thing i can remember about that what about you touched upon early at that moment and some of the storms that you encountered you know you remember anything any particularly rough seas no no no forty five thousand dub battleship been all right she did toss around a bit but you it was just one of those things you you never thought about it operation holbert never heard of it september forty one says operations participate in operation halbert along with the battleship nelson and rodney as well as the aircraft carry the art roy oh that's semended trinnited i never knew that what it was called yes that was a that was another another one we did there were fourteen transports and the orders were that the malta was on its knees and we had to escort and there was the nelson the rodney the ark royal as you say the prince of wales and oh dear i can't i've got it i think i've got it on my ramblings upstairs and there was three or four cruisers and i don't know how many destroyers and now our orders were motor at all costs and the germans attacked us and the only ship that got a torpedo was the nelson and she got a torpedo right in the bow that the ship the front of the ship and she was going down to about going along about five degrees in the water the bows were the bows she was sort of sailing slightly down in the water and the other thing i remember about that was the fact that i'm a german a a german plane now who was he attacking i can't remember who is attacking but i know one of the one of the a a crow aircraft got on his tail and shot him down and i'm not sure now i can't remember exactly but i i believe it was the prince of wales was firing anti aircraft and shot shot the and shot the british fighter down as well we shot the british fighter down he shot the german down and then we shot him down and i remember we got back after the cat after we had delivered the convoy we went back into jiberolta for a day s days leave and we we happen to meet this pilot he was rescued the british part of the a fighter and the language that he calls the prince of wales and asked was he was unrepeatable when do you say you went to malta i take it you did you did you get on shore in malta no no no it is a question of delivering these transports to malta because they were starving and as soon as the old clear was gone we we turned round and went straight back and say we called in at gibraltar for the day i remember the shops in motor of course have been wartime rationing and things like that and i found in a sweet shop a seven pound box of cars milk trade chocolates funny how you can remember these things and i bought this box of chocolates sealed with a brown paper sealed around the outside i slipped it off took one of the chocolates out for myself slipped it back wrapped it up took it to the padre on the prince wales who was a censor got it censored and i sent it home to my my mother unless that's the only thing that i can remember about malta
