I WAS BORN IN LONDON A CITY ROAD HOSPITAL NINETEEN TWENTY SIX MY MOTHER TOLD ME THE SNOW WAS UP TO THE WINDOW CELLS I HOPE SHE MEANT THAT THIS WAS ON THE GROUND FLOOR WITHIN A FEW DAYS I WAS A POORLY BABY I WENT DOWN WITH DOUBLE NEUMONIA WHICH WAS ONE OF THE CHILD KILLERS OF THOSE YEARS AND THEREFORE I WAS ON OPEN ORDER OPEN WOULD MEANT THAT EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS THEY TRACKED YOU JUST TO SEE IF YOU WERE STILL ALIVE AND ANY OF YOUR RELATIONS COULD COME IN AT ANY TIME TO ERM A TO SEE MYSELF AND MY MOTHER OF COURSE IN THE BED BY THE SIDE OF ME WAS STILL GOING ALRIGHT I WAS BAPTISED IN THE HOSPITAL CHAPEL AND FORTUNATELY I MANAGED TO OVERCOME THAT PROBLEM WHY DID YOU WANT TO JOIN THE NAVY AND WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND THERE I THINK REALLY IN THOSE DAYS IT'S DIFFICULT TO FOR PEOPLE TO SORT OF INVISIGES NOW A WAR WAS ON WITH PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF YOU WANTED TO FIGHT BACK HE SAID IT'S LIKE A BURGLAR TRYING TO BREAK INTO YOUR DOOR AND NORMALLY YOU'LL TRY AND STOP HIM AND I WAS DOING A CERTAIN AMOUNT WITH THE ARP AND I REALLY WANTED TO GO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER SO I THOUGHT ABOUT IT I THOUGHT WELL I'LL TRY AND GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INVOLVED SO I WENT TO THE LOCAL DRILL HALL WHERE THEY USUALLY TAKE VOLUNTEERS FOR ANY OF THE THREE SERVICES THIS IS THE ONE IN MEDGEWERE DENSBROOK ROAD AND VOLUNTEERED FOR THE NAVY I CAME ALONG TO PASS ALL THE TESTS I THINK THERE A LITTLE A FEW WEEKS LATER AND THEY ACCEPTED ME AND SAID A LETTER WOULD FOLLOW BUT THEY COULDN'T TAKE ME AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WAS ONLY SEVENTEEN THEY SAID THEY'D TAKE ME AT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF PROVIDING THE JOB I WAS GOING TO DO IN THE NAVY TOOK ABOUT SIX MONTHS SO I'D BE EIGHTEEN AT THE TIME WHEN I COULD GO ON BOARD A SHIP SO I ALWAYS STARTED WORK ON THE MONDAY AFTER THAT I SAID TO THE FOREMAN WELL I'VE JOINED THE NAVY I'M GOING OH NO NO YOU CAN'T DO THAT WE WANT YOU HERE WE'RE DOING MORE WORK HERE WE CAN STOP YOU YOU DON'T HAVE TO JOIN THE NAVY I SAID I'VE MADE UP MY MIND I'M JOIN THE NAVY FORGET IT AND IT'S ANOTHER BIT OF LUCK BECAUSE THAT FIRM WAS WORKING ONE HUNDRED PERCENT WITH ASPASTUS AND AT THE TIME THERE WAS NO PROBLEM OF COURSE I'LL FIND OUT LATER ON NEARLY EVERYBODY IN THAT FIRM THAT I KNEW DIED OF ASBESTOSIS SO HE MUST HAVE BEEN ANOTHER ONE OF MY LUCKY LUCKY TIME SO ANYWAY FROM THERE DEAD ON MY AGE OF SEVENTEEN AND A HALF A LETTER ARRIVED REPORT TO THE DRILL HALL WHERE YOU JOINED AND YOU'LL BE TAKEN ON FROM THERE TO HMS ROLE ARTHUR SO DULY I TURNED UP THERE A LITTLE CROWD OF US GOT ON A TRUCK I THINK IT WAS TOOK US TO THE LONDON STATION AND THE LONDON STATION A GROUP OF US WENT UP TO RMSCAGANESTS AND THERE WE ARE A ROYAL ARTHUR THERE WE DID ALL JOINING ROUTINE GET A UNIFORM AND BE TOLD LOTS OF THINGS ABOUT THE NAVY LOTS OF HORROR STORIES I'M AFRAID ESPECIALLY WITH WHAT IS KNOWN NOWADAYS AS WELL I THINK IT'S FUNERAL DISEASE IN THAT DAY WHICH WAS RIFE AND SO I WENT ON FROM THERE AFTER I PASSED ALL MY USUAL TESTS UP TO HIM SCOTIA WHERE I WENT THROUGH THE EXAM FOR A TELEGRAPHIST IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR I WENT DOWN FROM THERE TO ROYAL ART AGAIN AND AT THAT TIME D DAY WAS COMING UP AND THEY'D HAD QUITE ENOUGH TELEGRAPHIST TO ALL THAT THEY WANTED THEY SAID WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHANGE OVER TO SOMETHING ELSE I SAID WELL YOU KNOW IF YOU NEED SOMETHING ELSE AND YES WELL YOU CAN BECOME AN ABLE SEAMAN AND FROM THERE THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS YOU GO IN FOR SO I THOUGHT I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT SO ALTHOUGH I WAS A TELEGRAPHIST BECAUSE I PASSED THE EXAM I WENT DOWN FROM THERE TO MS GANGES GANGES WAS TOUGH YOU CAN'T SAY THAT HARD ENOUGH IT WAS TOUGH AFTER BEING IN SOMEWHERE LIKE ERM TIMES SCOTIA WHICH WAS QUITE EASY YOU IT WELL BECAUSE YOU HAD TO BE A NAVAL SEAMAN AND A NAVAL SEAMAN WAS GOING AS IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A TOUGH JOB FOR ONE THING BECAUSE D DAY WAS COMING UP YOU DID TRAINING TO TO FIGHT ON THE LAND AS WELL AS FIGHT ON THE SEA SO WE WERE GOING IN FOR BAYONET PRACTICE THROWING HAND GRENADES AMONGST YOUR ORDINARY SEAMANSHIP JOBS AND D DAY HAPPENED WHILE I WAS STILL THERE AND YOU COULD HEAR THE FIGHTING GOING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HARWICH FROM FROM THE LANDINGS AND WE WERE GIVING BLOOD AS MUCH AS WE CAN FOR THE INJURED AND WE WERE TOLD SEVERAL TIMES THAT IF THE FIGHTING GETS ANY WORSE AND IT'S HORRIFIC NOW YOU'LL BE OVER THERE JOINING THEM WHETHER WHETHER YOU'RE FULLY TRAINED OR NOT SO FORTUNATELY THE FIGHTING ALTHOUGH INJURIES DIDN'T GET TOUGHER THAN THEY WERE SO PASSED OUT AS ORDINARY SEAMAN AND THEN AFTER THAT I WAS ASKED IF I WANTED TO DO WHAT IT WAS CALLED A SUB RATE THE SUB RATE YOU COULD BE AN ATTIC OPERATOR A GUNNER YOU COULD BE A TORPEDO MAN WELL AS I WAS ALREADY CARRIED OUT TRAINING AS A TELEGRAPHIST BEING A RADIO OPERATOR SEEMED ABOUT THE NEXT STEP ANYWAY THAT WAS ANOTHER SHORT COURSE OVER THE ISLE OF MAN IS ALL STONE FRIGATES THAT YOU'VE BEEN TO THEY WERE ALL STONE FRIGATES EM ALL THE LAND BASES STONE FRIGATES SO SO FAR I'D NEVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP ONLY LITTLE WHALERS AND THIS TYPE OF THING WHERE WE DID SAILING LEARNED TO SAIL LEARN TO DO ALL THE KNOTS AND EVERYTHING IN GANGES SO ANYWAY BETWEEN THAT WHEN I HAD FINISHED MY TELEGRAPHIST COURSE AND UM THEY SAID TO ME WELL WE'RE NOT SURE WHETHER WE WEREN'T ENOUGH TELEGRAPHISTS THEY SAID THERE'S LOTS OF OPTIONS SO I SAID WELL CAN I HAVE THE OPTION HE SAID YEAH WELL ONE NICE JOB THAT'S COMING UP NOWADAYS IS A SIGNALMAN ON LANDING CRAFT I SAID THEY SAID WELL YOU'VE DONE ALL THE TRAINING YOU DON'T ONLY HAVE TO LEARN TO BE A SIGNALMAN WITH A FLAG AND SO FORTH BUT I CAME INTO MY HEAD WITH THE VISION OF A LANDING CRAFT AND ME STANDING UP AT THE FRONT THERE FLAG WAVING AND THE GERMANS SHOOTING AT THE FLAG WAVE I SAID NO I'M NO HERO I'LL COME HERE TO DO A JOB I'M NOT A HERO SO ANYWAY SO I FINISHED UP AS A RADAR OPERATOR THERE WAS TWO TYPES OF RADAR OPERATORS RADAR PLOT AND THERE WAS RADAR GUNNERY CONTROL WELL AS I CARRIED OUT GUNNERY IN GANGES ON BIG GUNS THEY HAD SIX INCH HEAVY GUNS THERE THAT YOU TRAINED I OPTED FOR THE RADAR CONTROL GUNNERY SO I DID THAT COURSE AND FROM THERE I WENT DOWN TO UM ER CHATHAM WHICH WAS MY BASE ANYWAY I WAS AT CHATHAM RATING AND WAITED THERE FOR A SHIP WHILE YOU'RE WAITING FOR A SHIP ALL YOU DO IS WALK ABOUT THE BARRACKS HAVE JOBS LIKE PAINTING COAL WHITE OR SWEEPING UP OR DIFFERENT PLACES AND YOU GO DOWN EVERY EVENING IN YOUR OWN TIME TO WHAT I BELIEVE IS CALLED THE OLD BIG BARN AND HAVE LISTS OF PEOPLE TO GO ON DRAFT FOR A SHIP WELL THE FIRST ONE I CAME ACROSS OF GOING DOWN THERE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS I HAD MY NAME ON THERE'S QUITE A LOT IN THIS DRAFT SO WE HAD TO GO FOR SOME REASON TO HAVE A MEDICAL EVERYBODY HAD TO PASS FOR A MEDICAL THAT WAS ON THAT DRAFT WHERE IT WAS WHAT IT WAS FOR THEY NEVER TELL YOU THEY NEVER TELL YOU IN THE NAVY IS KNOWN AS THE SILENCE SERVICE HE NEVER TOLD ANYTHING SO ANYWAY THEY WENT THROUGH THIS MEDICAL EXAMINATION AS IT CAME TO MY TURN TO SEE THE MEDICAL OFFICER HE SAID OUT HE WAS OUT I STAND OUT ON ONE SIDE AND WAIT TO SOME TIME HE CAME ACROSS AND I SAID WHAT'S WRONG I FEEL ALRIGHT HE SAID YOU GOT GERMAN MEASLES WELL MY GOODNESS GERMAN MEASLES AND YOU'RE FIGHTING THE GERMANS SAID I'M NOT HAVING BEEN ANYWHERE NEAR GERMANY HE SAID DON'T BE FUNNY IT OUT I SPENT A FEW WEEKS IN A SICK BAY I'VE GOT NO MEMORY AT ALL OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE I DON'T THINK ANYTHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED BUT IF YOU'RE GOING ON THE DRAFT AND GOING ON THE SHIP OBVIOUSLY TWO HUNDRED MEN UP ON THE SHIP COULD PASS IT ON SO A FEW WEEKS TIME SO MY NAME WAS ANOTHER DRAFT AND THIS WAS FOR HMS KARAN AND WE'RE NOT TOLD WE JUST TOLD WE WERE GOING ON A DRAFT AND HAVING A NUMBER OF DRAFT SO WHEN THE TIME CAME THERE WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED OF US FROM CHATHAM WE WERE PUT ON NAVY TRUCKS ON BACK WELL OVER BACK OPEN BACK COVERED TRUCK TAKEN DOWN TO THE LONDON STATION I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IT WAS NOW BUT ALL OF US ON ONE TRAIN I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY OTHER ANY OTHER PEOPLE ON THAT TRAIN EVERYONE AT THE DOORS WERE LOCKED WE WERE LOCKED IN AND A YOUNG LAD BY THE SIDE OF ME SAID YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S FOR I SAID YEAH STOP US GETTING OUT NO IT'S NOT STOP THE GIRLS GETTING TO US WHEN YOU GET TO A STATION THAT STARTED THE CHAT WE GOT FRIENDLY NONE OF US EVER KNEW EACH OTHER WE WE COME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE ANYWAY THAT WAS A LONG TRIP UP TO GLAD TO GO GLASGOW WE STOPPED QUITE A FEW TIMES I THINK FOR AIR RAID AND FOR NO REASON I BELIEVE WE STOPPED AT CARLISLE AND THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED AND THE CARRIAGES LOVELY CUPS OF TEA AND SANDWICHES PASSED ACROSS FROM THE VS OR WHOEVER NOW ANYWAY AFTER A LITTLE REST ON STARTED THE TRAIN AGAIN AS WE DREW OUT THE STATION I REMEMBER THERE WAS BIG FACTORY BY THE SIDE OF THE STATION RIGHT ON THE TRACK AN OLD MILL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND OUT OF THESE WINDOWS THERE WAS BALLOONS AND THE GIRLS WAVING THE BALLOONS WERE NOT SOME OF THE BALLOONS I CAN'T REMEMBER I THINK THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OF ANOTHER TYPE WHICH I WON'T MENTION BUT ANYWAY THAT WAS NICE WE LOVED THAT THE FACT OF BEING YOU KNOW CHEERED ON OUR WAY WE EVENTUALLY ARRIVED IN GLASGOW AND THE TRAIN CHANGED STRAIGHT AWAY OVER TO WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN A LOCAL TRAIN THAT TRAIN TOOK US TO GREENOCK GREENOCK WAS OUR DESTINATION AND WE WERE THEN PUT INTO UM IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE YMCA A BIG BUILDING AND WE WERE THEN TOLD THAT WE WERE DUE TO HAVE THE SHIP'S COMPANY OF A BRAND NEW SHIP BEING BUILT IN THE SHIPYARD WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THE MS ARTYMTA REALLY NOW IT WASN'T READY WE COULD GO AND LOOK OVER THE SHIP ANY TIME WE LIKED A MASSIVE WIRES AND PEOPLE WELLED IN AND I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT WE DID WE MUST HAVE WALKED ABOUT GREENOCK ANYWAY IN A FEW WEEKS THE SHIP WAS READY ALL THE OLD WIRES AND BITS AND PIECES HAD BEEN REMOVED AND WE WERE GIVEN OUR PLACES I WAS ON THE FOREHEAD MESS DECK WE WERE POINTED OUT WHERE WE HAD OUR LOCKER WHERE WE PUT NEW CLOTHES WE WERE IN UNIFORM NOW OF COURSE ALL OUR CIVILIAN CLOTHES HAD GONE SO WE JUST HAD A NAVAL CLOTHES THE FIRST THINGS WE HAD TO DO GO THROUGH TRIALS THE TRIALS WERE TAKEN UP THE CLYDE YOU HAD TO DO THIS SPEED WHATEVER WAS DETERMINED AND A FEW GUNNERY TRIALS ANYWAY WHEN WHEN WE FINISHED THE TRIALS AND THE SHIP WAS COMMISSIONED THEN INTO THE ROYAL NAVY THAT WAS THE TIME WE WAS GOING TO BE OFF NONE OF US WOULD EVER WAS TOLD THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO ON A CERTAIN DAY SO IF WE HAPPENED TO BE HAVING SHORE LEAVE WE COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY BUT THEN ONE DARK NIGHT SHORTLY AFTER WE FINISHED OUR TRIALS WE SLIPPED FROM THE DOCK DOCK SIDE OF THE ERM THE YARD THE YARD AND EDGED OUR WAY UP THROUGH THE CLYDE NO LIGHTS OF COURSE CLOSED ALL THE WATER TIGHT DOORS ALL THE SCUTTLE ALL THE DEAD LIGHTS AND WE WERE GIVEN OUR POSITIONS THAT WE WERE ON WATCH THEN WE WERE REAL SAILORS THEN SO I WAS STARBOARD WATCH SO THEREFORE I WOULD BE UP ON THE HALF AN HOUR ON THE STARBOARD LOOKOUT WE WE NEVER HAD ANY ACTUAL TRAINING FOR THIS WE JUST WERE TOLD TO DO WHAT WE WERE TOLD SO ANYWAY WE EASED OUT OF THE CLYDE YOU HAVE TO GO PAST THE BOOM WHICH LET YOU OUT OF THE DE CLYDE AND I REMEMBER I CAME OFF WATCH OR HADN'T GONE ON WATCH I CAN'T REMEMBER AT THIS STAGE BUT I'D HAD REASON TO GO TO THE HEDGE WHICH THE TOILETS I SIT DOWN JUST SITTING DOWN AND THERE'S AN ENORMOUS EXPLOSION BANG AND WAS A PULL ME ROUNDED UP QUICKLY RUSHED OUT OF THE THE DOOR INTO THE WHAT I CALL THE CANTEEN FLAT THAT'S JUST THE PASSAGEWAY AND BUMPED INTO ONE OF THE OTHER SAILORS WHO WAS OBVIOUSLY A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERIENCE OF ME IF WE BEEN TORPEDOED ON OUR FIRST NIGHT OUT NO IT'S ONLY THE TORPEDO TRYING A DEPTH CARDED OUT SHAMEFACED I DIDN'T GO BACK HE SAID WELL YOU WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE ANYWAY SO WE HAD A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT THAT ANYWAY FROM THERE AS I SAY IT WAS A DARK NIGHT WAS IT ALL SO CLANDESTINE WHEN YOU LEFT WELL THIS IS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THE ENEMY KNEW THERE WAS SHIPS BEING BUILT NEARLY ALL THE TIME AND THEY WOULD COME OUT OF THE CLYDE OR COME OUT OF THE TYNE OR PERHAPS COME OUT OF IRELAND AND YOU CAN VISUALIZE IRELAND AND SCOTLAND AND IT NARROWS IT'S REALLY WIDE NOW IT'S A LONG DISTANCE BUT IT NARROWED AS A CONTINENT AND THEREFORE SHIPS HAVE TO COME IN AND OUT OF THAT AREA WELL THIS WAS ALWAYS THE PLACES WHERE YOU'D HAVE TWO OR THREE U BOATS JUST LURKING HOPING FOR A GOOD KILL AND WHETHER THEY EVER FOUND OUT THAT A SHIP FROM ANY SPIES OR ANYTHING WAS COMING OUT AT THAT TIME I'VE NO IDEA BUT THAT WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS PART BECAUSE NONE OF US HAD WORKED TOGETHER WE'D ALL COME OUT OF TRAINING WE'D HAD GOOD TRAINING IN OUR OWN JOBS BUT OF COURSE NOT AS A TRAINING BECAUSE WE WERE NOT THE SAME PEOPLE WE WERE TRAINING WITH SO FROM THERE ONWARDS YOU UP FOR HEBRIDES IT WAS REALLY THE FEW SAILORS THAT EXPERIENCED AND THE OFFICERS OF COURSE WHO WERE EXPERIENCED YOU HAD TO HAVE ALL THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO DO WHAT YOU WERE DOING BECAUSE YOU'D GET NO ESCORT YOUR SHIP COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN WITH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE CREW THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TO SEA BEFORE NEVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP BEFORE VERY OFTEN SO IF WE'D BEEN ATTACKED AT THAT TIME WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A SITTING DUCK WHEN WE ARRIVED AT SCAPA FLOW WHICH IS RELATIVELY SAFE WE GO THROUGH THE BOOM AGAIN TO GET INTO THE FLOW AND FROM THEN ONWARDS YOU DO OUR TRAINING WELL THE TRAINING AT SCAPA FLOW REALLY IS TO GET YOU WORKING AS A TEAM THE WHOLE SHIP HAS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING A GUN CREW OF FOUR OR FIVE HAD TO KNOW HOW TO WORK TOGETHER IF YOU IN THE TRANSMITTING STATION WHICH IS THE ONE ON AN EARTH CENTRES LIKE WE WERE AS GUNNERY CONTROL YOU'D HAVE ABOUT TEN PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM WAS ONLY THE SIZE OF AN ORDINARY SITTING ROOM AND EACH ONE OF THOSE HAD A JOB TO DO BECAUSE ON A DESTROYER WHICH WE WERE SO AS A DESTROYER A BRAND NEW ONE AS WELL SO NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO WE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE FIRE CONTROL TABLE AS IT WAS WHEN YOU GET EIGHT PEOPLE ON IT AND ALL THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THEY'RE TRAINED ON SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THE TRAINING THEY STILL HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT IF THE SHIPS ATTACKED OR IF WE ATTACK ANOTHER SHIP SO THAT WAS WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF US IN THE FLOW AT THAT TIME WE WERE SO SHORT OF DESTROYERS IN PARTICULAR AND OTHER ESCORT SHIPS SO NOT ONLY WERE WE STAYING IN A SAFE AREA TO DO OUR TRAINING WE WERE SENT OUT IN HARNESS AS IT WAS CALLED WITH ANOTHER SHIP THAT MIGHT BE MORE EXPERIENCE BUT THEN OF COURSE THERE'S ONLY ONE OF YOU HAD EXPERIENCE AND ONE WHICH IS TRAINING WHICH IS US SO WE LEARNT IT THE HARD WAY ALL OUR REAL FIGHTING WAS AROUND THAT TIME AT THE END OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH WAS ERM OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER WAS AROUND THAT AREA SO THEY'D SEND US OUT WITH ANOTHER SHIP AND THIS IS IN ONE CASE WE WERE THE ONLY SHIPS THAT WERE IN THE FLOW DESTROYERS AND WE WERE OF COURSE DUTY DESTROYER AND HMS BULL ON WHICH WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AT THAT TIME WAS A SHIP THAT HAD SUNK SO WE WERE SENT OUT TO BASIC TRAINING ON THIS WE HAD A CALL TO GO TO A SHIP OFF CAPE ROTH THAT HAD BEEN SUNK WE DIDN'T KNOW OR HAD BEEN TORPEDOED THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY OUR MESSAGE WAS NOT THAT IT HAD BEEN SUNK A SHIP HAD BEEN TORPEDOED AND TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO GO OUT TO TRY AND HELP TO CATCH THE U BOAT HAD SUNK AND TO PICK UP SURVIVORS IF THERE WERE ANY THERE SO THERE WAS TWO OF US AND IT SEEMED FROM THE RECORDS I'VE LOOKED UP THE OTHER SHIP THAT WENT OUT WITH US WAS ANOTHER SHIP THAT WAS ALSO WORKING OUT SO THESE TWO DESTROYERS WERE ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE AT AY HAD TO GO OUT TO THE SHIP I FOUND OUT LATER IN LIFE IT WAS HMS BULLEN WHICH WAS ESCORT VESSEL AND THEY'D BEEN LOOKING FOR A U BOAT THE VERY U BOAT THEY'D BEEN LOOKING FOR HIT ONE OF OUR SHIPS FIRST SO HMS BULLEN THAT HAD BEEN SUNK AND OTHER SHIPS THAT WERE WITH US WERE STILL LOOKING FOR THE U BOAT WELL THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS UM OUR SKIPPER WAS VERY KNOWLEGIBLE VERY EXPERIENCED AND HE WENT TO THE POSITION WHERE THE WHERE THE U BOAT HAD SUNK HMS HMS BULLEN NOBODY WAS TOLD ANYTHING HE KNEW IT WAS MISSILE AND NONE OF US WERE TOLD SO THE FIRST THING YOU DO YOU GO AROUND THE DEPTH CHARGE IN THE WHOLE OF THE AREA IN CASE THE U BOAT IS STILL THERE WELL WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH TOLD OUR ASIC OPERATOR THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DOWN THERE WHICH COULD BE THE U BOAT SO WE DEPTH CHARGE THAT AREA AND APPARENTLY THE MECHO DIDN'T MOVE IT STAYED THERE SO WE ASSUMED THAT THAT WAS A U BOAT AND NEVER NEVER CAME UP NEVER GOT ANY OIL NEVER GOT ANYTHING SO AT THAT TIME OF THE WAR THE SNAKE HAD ONLY JUST STARTED SO WHICH HELPED THEM LATER ON IN THE WAR NOW THIS U BOAT IF IT DID COME UP WITHIN TWELVE HOURS THEN IT WAS A DEAD DUCK SO WE WAITED AROUND THERE ALL NIGHT WITH A BOARDING PARTY READY TO GO ONTO THE U BOAT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME UP FOR AIR IF IT HADN'T BEEN AND THEN IT SEEMED WE HAD TO GO ON ANOTHER JOB I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE BUT WE HAD TO GO ON AN ESCORT JOB SO WE STOOD DOWN THE WHOLE TEAM I WAS LOOKING IN THE NEXT MORNING WE STOOD DOWN THE TEAM OF THE BOARDING PARTY AND I WAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE OF THE SHIP I HAD NO WORK TO DO I WAS OFF WATCH AND I COULD SEE IN THE NEAR DISTANCE A MAGNETIC MINE FLOAT PAST BUT NOBODY SHOT AT IT WHICH THEY MIGHT DONE USUALLY JUST IN CASE THERE WAS A U BOAT DOWN THERE WOULD KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL THERE WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE ALL NIGHT YOU NEVER STARTED YOUR ENGINES BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT U BOAT IF IT WAS STILL ALIVE DOWN THERE TO KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL UP THERE WAITING SO IN THE END WE WENT BACK TO FLOW AND CARRIED ON WITH OUR LEARNING TO FIGHT A WAR TELL ME ABOUT CHRISTMAS IN SCAPA WELL THIS WAS THIS I TOLD YOU ABOUT WAS THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER THEN THE SMALL JOB WE MIGHT HAVE DONE THERE I'M NOT SURE BUT THE NEXT IMPORTANT THING I CAN REMEMBER IS THAT WE WERE ERM NOT REQUIRED FOR WORK AROUND THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD SO WE WERE BACK IN SCAPA FLOW AND IT WAS QUIET AND WE WERE SAFE BUT NONE OF US HAD HAD A CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME BEFORE THIS AND THERE WE ALL WERE IN A DEAD PLACE SCAPAFLOW SCAPA FLOW A TERRIBLE PLACE DEAD AS ANYTHING AND WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS THERE WAS TWO HUNDRED ON THIS SHIP ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED SHIPS COMPLEMENT AND LUCKILY WE HAVE A FEW AMONGST US THAT WERE EXPERIENCED AND THERE WE WERE THE COOKS IN THE MESS WERE MAKING CHRISTMAS CAKES WITH WHATEVER STUFF WE COULD GET HOLD OF YOU ALSO MANAGED TO GET I'M NOT SURE WHERE FROM A CHRISTMAS TREE FOR SOMEWHERE AND THAT IS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE MAST ON THE TOP OF EVERY SHIP AT CHRISTMAS TIME IF THEY'RE IN HARBOUR THEY HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE WHICH IS RUN UP ON TOP OF THE SHIP AND WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED I THINK BY THE OFFICERS BEING CHRISTMAS BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER WE WERE OR NOT AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE A DRINK ON BOARD IT'S A DRY SHIP BUT SOME OF THE OLD STAGES HAD SAVED SOME OF THEIR RUM RATION WHICH YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO BECAUSE I WAS VERY HIGH CHARGE AS YOU WERE CALLED BUT THE OFFICERS NORMALLY ON A ON A SMALL SHIP LIKE A DESTROYER CLOSED THEIR EYES TO A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO IF THEY WERE ON A BIG SHIP THAT YOU CALL A PASSE SHIP SO MANY OF THE LADS THAT WERE ALLOWED RUM I WASN'T BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED RUM UNTIL YOU WERE TWENTY AND I WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN OUT CAME THE RUM RATION HORRIBLE I HATE IT AND UM PEOPLE MADE UP THINGS OUT OF PAPER I THINK PACKAGING PAPER RED GREEN AND BLUE CAME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES OUT OF HOLES AND MADE INTO DECORATIONS AND WE WERE MORE A BOY THERE AT THE TIME AND SING CHRISTMAS SONGS SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAD INSTRUMENTS WE HAD A SMALL BAND ON BOARD AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE I SUPPOSE SOME OF OUR LADS WHO COME FROM HOMES THAT HAD NEVER HAD IT BAD I THINK IT WAS VERY TEARFUL FOR THEM I CAME FROM A HOME THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY SO CHRISTMAS WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FOR ME SO ANYWAY WE ALL ENJOYED OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME AND IN A PLACE LIKE SCAPA FLOW SO THAT WAS QUITE GOOD THE COMMANDER WILKINSON WAS OUR CAPTAIN AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A LIFE FOR HIM REALLY AFTER WE'D BEEN WITH HIM FOR A TIME BECAUSE ALTHOUGH HE WAS VERY STRICT HE WAS QUITE HAPPY TO TURN HIS LIFE HE WAS A LAD THE SAME AS US LATER ON IN THE STORY WHEN WE GOT A FAR EAST I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT BUT WE HAD ERM MULTI POLO TEAMS AND HE WAS ON THE TEAM WITH THE LADS AGAINST THE OFFICERS AND THAT WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON HE WOULD BE AND HE WAS I THINK BOXING CHAMPION OF THE FLEET OR PART OF THE FLEET AND HE WAS SUCH A NICE PERSON YOU KNOW AND THERE IS ANOTHER CASE I TAKE IT TO IN A LITTLE WHILE WHEN I GO ASHORE SO BUT THE NEXT THING WE WENT ON REALLY AFTER CHRISTMAS AFTER CHRISTMAS WAS WHEN WE REALLY STARTED LEARNING THAT THERE WAS A WAR ON WE WOULD STILL GO OUT WOULD STILL GO OUT AS A SHIP WORKING UP TOGETHER BUT THE FIRST ONE WE WENT OUT WITH I BELIEVE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND THIS WAS TO BE A STRIKE AGAINST NORWAY WE DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL WE WERE AT SEA THAT WE WERE DOING THIS BUT THERE WAS THE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS SOME MORE DESTROYERS I THINK AND SOME OTHER SHIPS NOW OUR JOB WAS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT THEM ONE OF THE CARRIERS BUT IT WAS ALSO TO ACT AS A LIFEBOAT REALLY WELL WHEN THE AIRCRAFT TOOK OFF AND I THINK A COUPLE OF THESE WERE OLD TYPE AIRCRAFT UM I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF BUT THEY WERE BIPLANES NOW THIS WAS A REALLY ROUGH DAY AND THEY TOOK OFF I WATCHED THEM I WASN'T ON WATCH ALL THE TIME AND I WATCHED THEM FROM THE DECK AND THE CARRIER WAS BOUNCING UP AND DOWN BUT THEY TOOK OFF AND I THINK THEY CARRIED OUT I TRIED TO CARRY OUT THEIR TASK BUT THE TWO ARE COME BACK DIDN'T MAKE IT BECAUSE THE SHIP WAS DANCING UP AND DOWN THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER DANCING UP AND DOWN AND I BELIEVE ONE OF THEM HIT THE DECK WAS PUSHED OVERBOARD THAT'S WITH THE PEOPLE IN IT THEY CAN'T TAKE THEM OUT PUSH THEM OVERBOARD TO MAKE WAY FOR ANOTHER ONE LANDING AND THE OTHER ONE DISAPPEARED I THINK HE WAS GIVEN ORDERS TO TRY AND FLY BACK TO HIS BASE OR A BASE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH TO LAND ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER WE I THINK BEING A CRASH BOAT IT WAS CALLED WE WENT TO TRY AND FIND THE AIRCRAFT THAT DITCHED SADLY NO AIRCRAFT SO ANYWAY I THINK THEY HAD TO CALL OFF STRIKE BECAUSE IT WAS JUST TOO TOO DANGEROUS TO DO ANY MORE UM FLYING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO THAT WAS REALLY A BAD BEGINNING TO MY WAR WE WENT BACK TO SCAPA YOU TALK ABOUT IT BEING ROUGH HOW WERE YOUR SEA LEGS TERRIBLE I WAS SEASICK MOST TIMES I WENT TO SEA BUT WHEN WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE ON THE LOOKOUT OR WHEN YOU'RE IN THE TS WHICH IS IN CAME THE TS IS DOWN BELOW AND THAT IS THE TRANSMITTING STATION THAT TAKES THE THAT'S LIKE A RELAY FROM THE DIRECTOR TOWER WHICH IS RIGHT UP TO THE TOP OF THE SHIP THROUGH U IN HATS TO THE MAIN ARMAMENT WHICH IS FOUR FOUR INCH GUNS SO I WAS THE COMMUNICATION NUMBER SO THE DIRECTOR WOULD SPEAK TO ME THE OFFICERS TWO OFFICERS IN DIRECTOR WOULD BE SPEAKING TO ME AND I WOULD BE SPEAKING TO THE GUNS BUT APART FROM THAT THE DIRECTOR WOULD HAD INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD SEND SIGNALS DOWN TO OUR BIG COMPUTER THE ORIGINAL MECHANICAL COMPUTER AND A MECHANICAL COMPUTER SENDING THAT INFORMATION MECHANICALLY TO THE GUNS BUT ONCE I GOT INTO A POSITION WHERE THERE WAS EXCITEMENT FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT SEA SICKNESS I WAS OK SO THAT WAS A GOOD THING BUT NORMALLY IF I WASN'T ON WATCH STANDING I'D BE STANDING ON THE UPPER DECK WATCHING THE SEA HEAVING UP AND DOWN AND PROBABLY BEING SICK THE ONLY TIME YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS IS WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING ACTION YOU KNOW UM LATER ON WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE MINE LAY AND WE WERE ACTION STATIONS ALL THE TIME BUT IF YOU'RE DOING A JOB JUST ESCORTING THEN YOU'RE AT CRUISING STATIONS AND UNTIL SOME TROUBLE POPS UP UM DEPTH CHARGING U BOATS IS NOT A CASE OF GOING TO ACTION STATIONS IT'S ONLY IF THE U BOAT FIGHTS BACK THEN YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS SO ANYWAY WE WENT FROM THERE BACK TO SCAPA FLOW I THINK WE DID ONE OR TWO JOURNEYS LIKE THIS OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND EVENTUALLY WE SUPPOSEDLY FINISHED OUR TRAINING OF WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM MIND YOU ALL THIS TIME I'M TALKING TO YOU ABOUT NOW WE WERE STILL LEARNING BECAUSE WE WERE STILL TEAMING UP WITH PEOPLE THAT WE NEVER WORKED WITH BEFORE SO IF WE RUN INTO ANY REAL TROUBLE AT THAT TIME WE WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD A LOT OF CHANCE IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER ON WHEN WE HAD LEARNT THESE THINGS SO THE NEXT ONE I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT ONE IT IS IN ABOUT FEBRUARY I BELIEVE WE WERE JUST TOLD WE WERE GOING OUT I THINK THAT NIGHT WE WERE NOT GIVING ANY REAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE WE WERE GOING OR WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO BUT IT WAS A VERY BIG DO THERE WAS A VERY LARGE FORCE WE LEFT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT I BELIEVE IT IS THAT SCAPA THIS IS OUT OF SCAPA AND THIS THIS IS WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE MINE LAND OPERATION IT WAS A VERY IT WAS A ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO MOON IT WAS ALL STARLIGHT SO IT WAS A VERY GOOD VISIBILITY AND IT WAS A VERY CALM NIGHT STRANGE HARDLY ANY ROUGH SEA OR ANYTHING WE SET OUT AND OF COURSE YOU SELDOM KNOW WHO'S WITH YOU IT'S THE SILENCE SERVICE YOU'RE NOT TOLD ANYTHING AND WE'D BEEN ABOUT OUT ABOUT AN HOUR I BELIEVE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AND THE SKIPPER THEN SAID OVER THE TURN WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO HE'D OPENED HIS ORDERS AND HE TOLD US WE WERE A BIG FORCE ONE OF THE LARGE FORCE FOR GOING DOWN THE SOUTHERN PART OF NORWAY TO EGOSAND AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY WE WERE JUST ONE OF TWO SHIPS ERM THE OTHER ONE WAS AZELIUS SAME THE SAME DESTROYER AS WE WERE AND OUR MAIN ERM TASK WE HAD TO ESCORT THIS EM MINE LAYER HMS APOLLO EM FIRST OF ALL BOTH FORCES WORKING TOGETHER HAD TO PASS THROUGH A BIG MINE FIELD THERE'S A BIG MINE FIELD THAT WAS LAID I THINK BY US ERM AND WE HAD TO GO THROUGH ONE PATH THROUGH IT WHICH IS THE ONLY PATH THROUGH IT BUT WE KNEW WHERE THE OPENING WAS SO IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE ENOUGH BUT YOU DO GET LOOSE MINES SO OUR AS DECK OPERATOR HAD TO PICK OUT THE MINES AND I WAS ON WATCH AT ONE TIME AND I COULD HEAR HEAR HIM SAYING THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE PORT SIDE AND THE CAPTAIN WOULD MOVE THE SHIP OVER A BIT SO ANYWAY WE GOT THROUGH THE MINEFIELD ALL OF US WERE NO REAL PROBLEM AND THEN WE SPLIT UP WE WERE TO WAIT UNTIL TWELVE O'CLOCK AND AT THAT TIME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE OTHER BIG FORCE WE WERE BY THE WAY UP THERE AVAYA AT THAT POINT AND THE OTHER BIG FORCE WAS TWO CRUISERS I THINK NO AIRCRAFT CARRIED AT THAT POINT AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY A GERMAN CONVOY THAT WAS GOING TO LEAVE EGOS AND WAS GOING TO HUG THE COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO M STAVANGA WHERE WE WERE BUT THE OTHER FORCE TO STOP THEM GETTING THERE SO DAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK THE OTHER FORCE WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE CONVOY AND THEY WERE HOPING IN THAT CASE WHEN THAT STARTED THERE 'LL BE LOTS OF FIREWORKS DOWN FURTHER ALONG THE COAST IT WAS QUITE A FEW HUNDRED MILES BUT THAT WOULD TAKE THE HEAT OFF WHAT WE WERE DOING WE WERE A CLANDESTINE OPERATION THE WE WERE TO ESCORT THE APOLLO TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WAS GOING TO START LAYING MINES DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK AND WE WERE TO BE BETWEEN HER AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND IF SHE WAS SIGHTED ON BY THE GERMANS OR PICKED UP BY RADAR BY THE GERMANS AND THEY WERE TO START FIRING WE WERE TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS WE COULD AND TEAR UP AND DOWN THE BIT OF SEA BETWEEN US AND BETWEEN THE APOLLO AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND USED ALL THE GUNS AND FLARES AND EVERYTHING YOU COULD TO TAKE THE HEAT OFF HER SO THEY ATTACK US SO THE APOLLO WOULD HAVE EITHER FLASHED US OR INDICATED TO US OR NOT ON THE SHORE BECAUSE YOU COULD GIVE EVERYBODY HAD TO KEEP RADIO SILENCE AND WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO SMOKE SHOW ANYTHING YOU WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO BANG BECAUSE THE NOISE WE WERE NOT FAR AWAY FROM THE COAST OR TWO AND BUT THE SHIPS BOTH US AND THE OTHER ESCORT DESTROYED ELIAS HAD TO KEEP UP AS MUCH STEAM AS WE COULD BECAUSE IF THE FIREWORKS STARTED WE WERE TO HAVE TO AT FULL SPEED RUSH UP AND DOWN THIS BIT OF COAST FIRING WHATEVER WE COULD TO PREVENT THEM SEE THE APOLLO WELL I COULD HEAR FROM THE GUNS BECAUSE I WAS IN THE METS AND FROM THE DIRECTOR M BEFORE WE STARTED DOING ANYTHING AND I COULD HEAR THE PEOPLE AT THE GUN SAYING WELL I CAN SEE THE HEADLIGHTS THERE THEY'RE JUST JUST OVER THERE A LITTLE BIT THE CAR COMING DOWN GOING FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT AND I COULD HEAR ALL THIS THEY'RE SAYING HOPE THEY CAN'T SEE US FROM WHERE THEY ARE AND THEN HE SAID RIGHT THEY'VE STARTED DOWN THE OTHER END AND THEY STARTED FIRING DOWN AT THE OTHER END THEY ATTACKED THIS CONVOY AND THEY WERE BEING YOU COULDN'T SEE THAT WE COULDN'T I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING ANYWAY BECAUSE I WAS DOWN IN THE TS BUT I WAS GETTING ALL THE MESSAGES FROM NOT THE TWO OFFICERS UP IN THE ER DIRECTOR TOWER BUT FROM MY MATES ON A GUN GUN GUN GUN THEY WAS FUNDING IN ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE MEAN LOOK I THINK THAT BLOWS SMOKING OVER THE YOU KNOW ON THAT THEY CAN'T SEE US ANYWAY APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO MUCH SO WE WERE SLOWLY CRUISING UP AND DOWN AND THE APOLLO STARTED LAYING OUR MINDS DEAD ON TIME DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK NOW THE MINE LAYER IT'S A BIG MINE LAYER THEY CARRIED A LOT OF MINE A BIG CRUISER THEY ARE AND ONCE THEY STARTED LAYING A MINE AND THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME IN THEY CAN'T STOP THEY'VE GOT TO DO THE WHOLE OF THE MINE LAYING BECAUSE THE MINE FIELD IS BEING LAID SO THEY CAN'T TURN BACK THEY COULD ONLY GO ON AND CARRY ON LAYING THEIR MINE SO ANYWAY WE 'RE JUST GOING SLOWLY UP AND DOWN AND BECAUSE OUR SHIP WAS KEEPING STEAM UP READY FOR A QUICK DASH UP AND DOWN THE VALVE BLEW SO YOU GOT A NORMAL IS A WELL KNOWN DESTROYER WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP WHICH YOU DO EVERY TIME YOU COME IN AND OUT OF HARBOUR JUST TO SIGNAL AND APPARENTLY EVERYBODY WENT MAD THE CRUISER WENT MAD I WAS IN SILENT ROUTINE YOU KNOW AND THE FACT THAT WE WERE NEVER TRUST OUT NOT TO THE VERY END AND I THINK IT MIGHT EVEN BE IF ANYBODY HAD HEARD THAT WHOOP WHICH IS A WELL KNOWN BRITISH DESTROYER SIGNAL TO SAY YOU KNOW I'M COMING INTO HARBOUR OR SOMEWHERE THEY THOUGHT YOU KNOW I CAN'T BE A BRITISH DESTROYER NOT BEING DAFT ENOUGH TO DO A THING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW SO ANYWAY THEY LAID THEY LAID THE MINES AND THEN WE KNEW I DON'T KNOW BY SIGNAL OR WHAT SHE SAID ALL DONE YOU KNOW WE CARRIED OUT OUR MISSION YOU'RE BACK IN PORT AND I WAS AT THAT TIME LISTENING TO SOME OF THE ER AND THEY WERE SAYING LOOK AT HER MOVE AND SHE WAS DOING FORTY KNOTS SHE'S ONE OF THE FASTEST SHIPS THAT WERE AND THEY COULD SEE THE BOW WAVE MINE IS IT IS NIGHT BUT IT WAS STARLIGHT AND YOU COULD SEE YOU COULD SEE THE SHORE YOU COULD SEE THE PLACE WHERE THE GUNS WERE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A CRACK AT US SO THEY'D KNOWN AND AWAY WENT THE ERM APOLLO AND AT SPEED AND WE TURNED AROUND BUT WE WENT AS FAR AS WE COULD BUT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO AT A GOOD SPEED BECAUSE WE GOT A SIGNAL THAT THE GERMANS HAD JUST OUT THAT THEY WERE BEING ATTACKED ESPECIALLY FROM EGOSUNED WITH THE BATTLE WE HAD ON DOWN THERE AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE AFTERWARDS ON THE APOLLO WHEN I TOOK TOUCH WITH THEM THEY SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD AND THEY WERE IN THE M M WILLS TELEGRAPHERS OFFICE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT WE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED TO FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED BECAUSE THEY'D PICKED US UP ON RADAR THE FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED AND HE THINKS THAT THE UM APOLLO WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF COURSE HAD GIVEN THE RIGHT CHALLENGE ANSWER BUT THEN THEY CHALLENGED AGAIN LATER ON AND DIDN'T BECAUSE THE APOLLO HAD STARTED DISAPPEARING SO THEY SENT TORPEDO BOMBERS AFTER US AND THEY NEVER FOUND US SO WE GOT BACK OK SO THE MIND THE SUCCESSFUL OUR FORCE DOWN FURTHER INCAN EGOS AND AND STOPPED THE CONVOY GOING UP TO THE GERMAN CONVOY THEY'D SUNK ONE OR TWO OF THE SHIPS AND ONE OR TWO OF OUR SHIPS THAT HAD INJURED PEOPLE BUT THE WHOLE MISSION WAS SUCCESSFUL IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU WERE EXPENDABLE WHEN YOU WERE OUT THERE YEAH WITH YOUR PILOT YOU ARE WHY I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A DESTROYER WAS A VALUABLE BIT OF KIT TALK A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF DESTROYER AND IT'S COMPARABLE YEAH BECAUSE WHY SHOULD WHAT I SHALL BRING IN BECAUSE LATER ON UM WHERE WHEN TOWARDS THE END OF THE WAR WAS YOU WON'T BE IN THAT ONE IS WHEN WE WERE A BIG FORCE ESCORTING SOME OF THE CRUISER OUT TO THE FAR EAST WE ONLY TOOK THEM AS FAR AS GIBRALTAR YOU SEE AND THEN ANOTHER FORCE TAKES OVER BUT WE WERE ESCORTING A BATTLESHIP THE RENOWN AND WE WERE THE CLOSE ESCORT ONE DESTROYER EACH SIDE FAIRLY CLOSE WHEREAS OTHERS WERE FURTHER OUT AND IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY LIKE THIS AND I WASN'T ON WATCH WAS JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE BUT WE WERE QUITE CLOSE BECAUSE THE CLOSE ESCORT YOU SEE AND I'M JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE AND OVER THE TANNOY COMES A VOICE FROM THE CAPTAIN WE'RE NOW REACHING A DANGEROUS AREA AND THERE MIGHT BE U BOATS AROUND IF A U BOAT HAS FIRED A TORPEDO AND THAT IS WHAT WE SEE THE TRACK OF THAT TORPEDO HEADING TOWARD BIG SISTER WHICH THEY CALL RENOWN THEN WE STOP IT YOU KNOW WHAT WE MEAN YOU STOP IT AND THERE'S ME LOOKING OVER THE SIDE LOOKING AT THE TORPEDO BULGE ON THE RENOWN AND THINKING TO YOURSELF YES YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE TWO HUNDRED MEN JUST TO STOP A TORPEDO BENDING LITTLE TORPEDO BULGE YOU KNOW YOU KNOW JUST TELL ME A BIT ABOUT THE ROLE OF A DESTROYER WELL THE ROLE OF MOST DESTROYERS IS THEY'RE FAST THE MANEUVERABLE AND THEY'RE LIKE A SMALLER VERSION OF A CRUISER THEY HAVE ALL THE GUNNERY BUT SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'VE GOT FOUR BIG GUNS FOUR POINT FIVE BIG GUNS AND OTHER SMALLER GUNS SO THEY'VE GOT ALL THOSE THE ONE THING THEY'VE GOT EXTRA APART FROM THE SMALLER SIZE SCALED DOWN THE BIG SHIPS HAVE NOT GOT ANTI SUBMARINE EQUIPMENT THEY'VE GOT TORPEDOES AND THINGS BUT UNLESS THEY ARE SUBMARINES ON THE SURFACE THEY'VE GOT NO DEPTH CHARGES SO UM A DESTROYER HAS DEPTH CHARGES SO WE'RE THERE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIFFERENCE THE REASON WHY YOU GOT A DESTROYER AS WELL IS JUST AS I SAID I M CAPITAL SHIP OR WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE GUARDING IS TORPEDOED THE LAST RESORT IS YOU GETTING IN THE WAY OF THE TORPEDO THEY'D RATHER LOSE A SHIP THAT'S ONLY GOT TWO TWO HUNDRED MEN ON BOARD THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MEN ON THE BATTLESHIP REMOTE AS IT MIGHT BE IF IT'S GOT A TORPEDO BULGE AND THIS IS WHY WE SORT OF DESTROYERS BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM GET LOST BECAUSE THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN A TORPEDO IS SIGHTED IS TO GO TO ATTACK THE SUBMARINE THAT FIRED IT BUT YOU SHOULD BE NEAR ENOUGH TO GET IN THE WAY OF THE TORPEDO IF IT HAPPENS TO BE HEADING YOUR WAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALK A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WEREN'T ITEM YOU WERE VERY YOUNG CREW IS THERE A MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE ON BOARD WHERE YOU THOUGHT WE'RE WORKING BRILLIANTLY NOW WELL NOT REALLY YOU JUST SORT OF FIT IN PART OF LIFE IS YOU MANAGED TO FIT INTO EVERY SITUATION IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH AND I NEVER WORRIED YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD SWIMMER YOU MUST BE ALRIGHT EVEN IF THE SHIP SINKS BUT THEN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU SPEAK TO OTHER PEOPLE YOU'VE GOT SEA BOOTS ON AT THE TIME YOU HAVE A BELT WHICH SHOULD SHAVE YOU WHICH YOU WEAR ALL THE TIME AT SEA BUT YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT BELT BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT GETS IN THE WAY OF YOUR ARMS AND EVERYTHING SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU HAVE TO JUMP INTO THE HOGGING AS THEY CALL IT THE SEA THAT BELT MUSTN'T BE BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT MIGHT BREAK YOUR ARMS SO YOU'RE EXPECTED TO BLOW THAT UP WHEN YOU HIT THE SEA AND I CAN'T SEE HOW YOU LUCKILY I NEVER HAD TO BUT I HAVE SURVIVORS THAT HAVE TOLD ME YES I HAD TO BLOW IT UP AS SOON AS I HIT THE WATER AND I HAD NO BREATH AT ALL LEFT SO I COULDN'T BLOW IT UP BUT THE SEA BOOTS DRAG YOU DOWN BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE WEARING IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG EVENT YOU RECALL THEM WELL IT WAS REALLY MUNDANE MOST OF THE THINGS EVEN AS ESCORT TO THE MONSTERS THAT WE DID OUR ENEMY IN MOST CASES WAS SEA WE GOT BATTERED LEFT RIGHT AND CENTRE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE QUEEN MARY AND QUEEN ELIZABETH BECAUSE AS WE TOOK THEM OUT OF THE CLYDE WE ZIGZAGGED ALL THE WAY WITH THEM AND WE KEPT UP WITH THEM UNTIL THEY REACHED THEIR TOP SPEED WHICH WAS THE DISTANT FURTHER THE WAY ACROSS AND THEN WE LEFT THEM AND WE EITHER WAITED AROUND FOR THE NEXT ONE COMING IN FOR INSTANCE WE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN QUEEN MARY OUT AND WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO WAIT JUST A FEW HOURS FOR THE QUEEN ELIZABETH COME IN AND ALL THE TIME ONE OF YOU MIGHT PICK UP ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU THAT'S THE QUEEN MARY WOULD HAVE ITS OWN ASDIC BESIDES ITS OWN RADAR AND WE OF COURSE THE ASDIC AND THE RADAR AND OUR COHORT PERHAPS THE CAVALIER WOULD BE THE SAME WELL WHEN WE'D STEAM OUT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE APART AT THE EXTREME OF THE ASDIC CIRCLE YOUR RADAR CIRCLE SO YOU DIDN'T INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHER'S RETREAT OF THE WAVE AND IF WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SUBMARINE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A WELL IMMEDIATELY WE'D RUN UP A BLACK FLAG ON OUR FLAG DECK SO THE QUEEN MARY WOULD KNOW AND SO THE CAVALIER WOULD KNOW THAT WE PICKED UP AN ECHO IMMEDIATELY WE'D HIVE OFF TO ATTACK THAT ECHO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU WERE IN TROUBLE IF IT IS THAT'S A U BOAT HE MIGHT HAVE ALREADY FIRED ITS TORPEDO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU TURN OFF SWIFTLY AT FULL SPEED IF YOU CAN IF YOU GOT A BEAM YOU TURN OFF LEFT OR RIGHT YOU HIT WITH A BEAM A DESTROYER YOU GOT HARDLY ANY DRAFT YOU TURN OVER STRAIGHT AWAY SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY YOU NEVER DID WHETHER ITS LUCK OR MY JUDGMENT I DON'T KNOW BUT ANYWAY THEN IF YOU HADN'T BEEN HIT BY A TORPEDO THEN YOU'D FIND YOUR WAY TO WHEREVER THAT UM ECHO WAS AND YOU WOULD ATTACK THE ECHO SO YOU LOOSE OFF ABOUT TWO DEPTH CHARGES FROM ONE SIDE YOU FROM THE OTHER AND ROLL OFF OF THE TWO RACKS FROM THE REAR SO IT'S A PATTERN OF ABOUT TEN CHARGES WELL IF THE U BOAT IS A VERY EXPERIENCED ONE AND HE WAS WATCHING YOU ON THE PERISCOPE HE WOULDN'T BE THERE WHEN YOU ARRIVED HE WOULD EITHER HAVE GONE DOWN LOW OR HE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BUT AT LEAST YOU KEPT HIM DOWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF HIM HITTING YOUR CHARGE AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO TRY TO CATCH IT UP TAKE ABOUT HALF A DAY BECAUSE THEY'RE KEEPING THE SAME SPEED EVEN IF THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO LEAVE THE QUEEN MARY OR THE QUEEN ELIZABETH THE QUEEN MARY WOULD CARRY ON IT WOULDN'T STOP AND ONE OF THE WORST THINGS THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY'D ACTUALLY TORPEDOED TO QUEEN MARY THEN THEY WOULD HAVE LOST A LOT OF LIVES BECAUSE WHILE YOU'RE THE QUEEN MARY IF IT'S COMING BACK IN YOU'LL HAVE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF AMERICAN GIVES AND IT WOULD BE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND TO BE CARRYING NOW THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TIGHTEN UP THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BECAUSE THEY GOING FROM THE DIFFERENT DECKS ALL THE TIME IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF WE GO INTO ACTION STATIONS THEN WE CLOSE OUR WATER TIGHT DOORS WHICH MEANS IF YOU TORPEDO A MIND IT WILL ONLY DAMAGE THE COMPARTMENT YOUR WITHIN SO THE SHIP MOST LIKELY WON'T SINK BUT IF IT'S ON THE QUEEN MARY THEY HAVE GOT NO CHANCE OF ANY OF THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BEING CLOSED BECAUSE THEY'RE TRAVELLING BETWEEN THE DEFINITELY DIFFERENT DECKS PERHAPS SLEEPING ON ONE DECK TRAVELLING UP THE NECK DECK TO EAT FOOD ANOTHER DECK FOR EXERCISE THE TOP DECK IS ALWAYS EXCISE COULDN'T OF CLOSED THEIR FORTY TIGHT DOORS SO ANY OF THOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST DISASTERS YOU'D FIND WHAT WAS IT LIKE SEEING THE QUEEN MARY QUEEN ELIZABETH SAILING DID YOU HAVE ANY TIME TO DO WITH THEM WERE THESE SHIPS THAT YOU KNEW OF AND WERE PROUD OF ANYWHERE WELL UM ALL WE REALLY KNEW WAS THAT WE WAS GOING TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS OR BRING ONE OF THE MONSTERS IN OR IF IT WAS THE QUEEN MARY AND WE WERE IN GREENOCK THEN WE WOULD KNOW IS TO WHERE WE WERE TAKEN OUT AND THAT'S ALWAYS GOT THREE FUNNELS ANYWAY IF WE PICKED UP IF IT'S GOT THREE FUNNELS IT'S QUEEN MARY AND IT'S GOT TWO FUNNELS IT'S QUEEN ELIZABETH AND SO ON YOU AT FOUR FOUR FUNNELS WITH THE AQUITANIA AND SO IT WENT ON BUT YOU WERE NEVER TOLD YOU WOULD JUST SAIL OUT AND GO TO A RENDEZVOUS WHERE YOU WAIT AROUND OR YOU'VE ALREADY CONTACTED THAT SHIP TO SAY YOU'RE THERE AND YOU BRING IT IN VERY OFTEN EVEN WE TWO ESCORTS ONE WOULD BE GREENOCK AT THE CLYDE AND THE OTHER BE DOWN AT LIVERPOOL AND WE WOULD REACH A POINT OF RENDEZVOUS GOING OUT OF THE CLYDE AND THE OTHER ONE THE CAVALIER PERHAPS COME OUT OF LIVERPOOL AND THEN WE'D STEAM UP TOGETHER TO RENDEZVOUS POINT FOR THE MONSTER DID THIS HAPPEN ALMOST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK FOR ONE OR OTHER OF US WE NEVER HAD THE SAME COHORT BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T ALWAYS BE IN THE SAME AREA THEY'D BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE AND BETWEEN THAT IF YOUR DUTY SHIP IF THERE WAS AIRCRAFT CARRIER WHICH HAPPENED IN ONE CASE HAD BEEN TORPEDOED WE'D JUST COME DOWN FROM SCAPA TO TO GREENOCK AND WE'D JUST ARRIVED AT THE HARBOUR ENTRANCE WE WENT STRAIGHT TO AN OIL BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO FILL UP WITH OIL BECAUSE YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GO OUT AND JUST AS WE WERE AT THE OLA WE GOT AN EMERGENCY CORNWALL TO SAY THAT AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER HAD BEEN TORPEDOED JUST IN CLYDE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CLYDE SO WE EM JUST LET GO FROM THE OILER AND WE WENT STRAIGHT OUT TO TO THE THAN IT WAS AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND STRANGELY ENOUGH SHE WAS ON HER OWN SHE'D COME FROM LONDONDERRY SHE'D HAD NO ESCORT LUCKILY SHE DIDN'T HAVE A FULL COMPLEMENT OF OF SEAMAN AND SO FORTH AND SHE WAS COMING TO TO THE CLA I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY TORPEDOED THE TORPEDOED A MERCHANT SHIP AT THE SAME TIME AND THE U BOAT GOT AWAY ALTHOUGH WE WENT TO ATTACK IT AND IT WAS DARK AND ER WE LEFT THE OTHERS I THINK LOOKING FOR THE U BOAT AFTERWARDS WHEN WE GOING BACK INTO HARBOUR HOW LONG ARE YOU AT SEA WHEN YOU WERE OUT IN THE ATLANTIC HOW OFTEN YOU GOING BACK TO BASE AND IN LAND LOTS IN A DESTROYER NOT VERY LONG BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T GOT THAT MUCH FUEL AND ALWAYS USUALLY YOU TOP SPEED ALWAYS MANEUVERING YOUR ONLY WAY OF GETTING FUEL IF YOU'RE OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS FROM ONE OF THE BIGGER SHIPS EITHER FROM AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER OR SOMETHING AS BIG AS A BELFAST CRUISER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ALSO FOOD YOUR FOOD RUNS OUT AFTER A SHORT WHILE SO THE ONLY TIME WE WERE REALLY OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS WHEN WE WAS UP AT SCAPA WHEN WE WAS WORKING UP AND WHEN WE WERE GOING OUT ON EM FORAYS TO HELP TO SINK THE PITS OR DOING OTHER JOBS MOST OF THE OTHERS IT WAS A CASE OF GOING OUT JUST FOR A DAY OR TWO TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS AND THEN COME BACK WITH THE MONSTER OR TAKE ONE OUT AND LEAVE IT IN WHICH CASE YOU'D HAVE TO GO TO LONDON DERRY PERHAPS AND THEN COME OUT OF LONDON DERRY AGAIN AND YOU GO OUT ON THAT SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT RESPECT NO WE WERE NOT OUT FOR A VERY LONG THERE WAS ONLY ONE OCCASION WHEN WE WAS OUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME IT MUST HAVE BEEN OVER FIVE DAYS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE OCCASION WAS BUT WE HAD RUN OUT OF FOOD AND E WAS FURTHER UP IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND OUR CAPTAIN WAS AN X FISHERY FLEET MAN HE HAD HIS OWN FISHERY FLEET THEN SO WHAT HE DECIDED TO DO AS WE RUN OUT OF FOOD HE SAID I KNOW WHERE THE FISH ARE SO HE GUIDED THE SHIP UP TO WHERE WE KNEW THEY WERE PICKED UP A SON THE RADAR ON THE AS DECK DROPPED TO DEPTH HARLOWERED THE BOAT PICKED UP ALL THE FISH THAT CAME UP THAT STUNNED HE STOOD ON THE FORCE WE SAW HIM SAT ON THE FOIL AND SAID UP MY MIND PICKED THE BIGGEST ONE WE LIVED ON FISH FOR A FEW MORE DAYS AFTER THAT SO HE WAS VERY GOOD BUT OUR RUNS WERE MOSTLY JUST ABOUT FIVE DAYS AT A TIME BUT THAT MEANT THAT EVERY TIME WE CAME INTO THE ER EITHER SCAPE OR IF WE WERE IN LIVERPOOL OR TO THE CLYDE WE HAD TO ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF FUEL ON BOARD BECAUSE IF YOU WERE ASHORE AND A DUTY DESTROYER AND THEN IF SOMETHING COMES UP WHERE A SHIP'S BEEN SUNK YOU HAVE TO GO OUT STRAIGHT AWAY AND YOU MIGHT BE OUT FOR A LONG TIME LOOKING FOR A SUBMARINE OR MORE THAN ONE SUBMARINE SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THE FACT THAT WE NEVER WENT OUT FOR A LONG TIME OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OILING AT SEA WHICH IS A DANGEROUS PRACTICE ANYWAY AND PICKING UP FOOD AND EVERYTHING FROM IT CAN YOU DESCRIBE RADAR YES THIS IS THE JOB YOU WERE DOING RADAR YES RADAR IN DOING WELL FIRST OF ALL WHEN I WAS ON THE RADAR SET IT WAS ONLY A SMALL SET AND IT THE DIFFERENT TYPES THE TWO NINE THREE THAT IS HIGH UP ON THE MAST AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY FOR PICKING UP AIRCRAFT OR SURFACE SHIP REALLY DISTANT I CAN'T THINK OF THE RANGE OF IT BUT IT SENDS OUT A SIGNAL FROM THERE WHICH OF COURSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT ANYTHING YOU DON'T GET IT BACK BUT IF IT HITS ANYTHING EVEN CLIFFS OR AN AIRCRAFT OR A SURFACE SHIP THEN IT BALANCES BACK AND ON THE SCREEN UM WHICH IS AROUND SCREEN AND THE THE CURSER IS GOING AROUND ALL THE TIME THAT WILL SHOW A LP AND THAT BLIP YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S A CLOUD WHICH IT MIGHT BE IT DEPENDS ON YOUR RADAR BUT IT'S DOING VERTICAL OR ANGLER AND YOU WILL THEN READ OFF THE DISTANCE AND THE ANGLE OF EVERYTHING IF THIS IS MOSTLY ON A LEVEL BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER SCREAM WHICH GIVES YOU THE HEIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT SO YOU USE ONE WITH THE OTHER THAT WHEN THAT ERM SIGNAL ELECTRONIC SIGNAL HITS ANYTHING THEN IT RETURNS AND THEN YOU READ OFF THE DISTANCE OF IT BUT IT IT IS NOT IT'S EASIER TO USE EM WHERE YOU FIND A DIFFICULTY IS BY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT EITHER LAND BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF IT ON THERE OR IF IT'S A SMALL BLIP THEN IT'S AN AIRCRAFT A SHIP OR WHATEVER IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE USING ONE TYPE OF RADAR IT'S ONLY IT'S ONLY HORIZONTAL IF YOU'RE USING ANOTHER ONE IT CAN BE A HORIZONTAL OR AN AIRCRAFT AND IT WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD DISTANCE THE TIME IT TAKES OF COURSE IT'S BASED ON IF IT TAKES TEN SECONDS TO GET FROM THERE TO THERE THEN IT'S AND YOU READ IT FROM THE SCREEN LUCKILY AT OUR POINT IN THE WAR WE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH AIRCRAFT THE ONLY TIME WE WOULD HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THAT IS IF THE TORPEDO BOMBERS HAD BEEN SENT AFTER US OFF NORWAY THEN YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO USE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD KNOW THE YOU'D HAVE TO USE THE TWO RADAR SETS THEN THE ONE THAT GIVES YOU A SIGNAL WITH THE HEIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT THE OTHER ONE WHICH GIVES YOU DISTANCE OF IT THEN YOU'RE TRAINED TO KNOW WHICH IS THE DIFFERENCE AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT AS FAR AS I REMEMBER IF IT WAS ONE OF OUR OWN AIRCRAFT IT WOULD HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION SIGNAL WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW ON YOUR RADAR SET BEFORE IT GOT TO YOU SO YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE PRETTY WELL EXPERIENCED BUT MY TIME WAS NOT ALWAYS ON A RADAR SET YOU WERE SOMETIMES A LOOKOUT AS A SEAMAN WHERE YOU'RE SITTING UP IN A LOOKOUT BOX ON THE STARBOARD SIDE WITH MINE AND YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR AIRCRAFT WHICH WAS NOT VERY OFTEN WE SAW ERM SURFACE SHIPS OR MORE THAN LIKELY YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR A LITTLE TINY PERISCOPE WHICH IS VERY HARD TO SEE IN A ROUGH ATLANTIC OR YOU MIGHT BE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE THE TRACK OF A TORPEDO COMING TOWARD YOU IN WHICH CASE YOU GET INTO A PANIC AND CALL OUT QUICKLY TO THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE THE CAPTAIN OR THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH AT THE TIME IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE NOWADAYS IT'S ENCLOSED BUT IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE SO THE BRIDGE IS HERE YOU'VE GOT A LOOKOUT ON JUST HERE TO YOU JUST CALL OUT TO THAT PERSON ON THE BRIDGE OFFICER SHIP BEARING RED FIVE O GREEN FIVE WHERE YOUR POSITION IS ANGLE OF SIGHT IF IT'S AN AIRCRAFT AND YOU'D IMMEDIATELY LOOK AT IT AND DECIDE WHAT ACTION TO TAKE BUT IF YOU'RE IN THAT LOOKOUT POSITION WHICH I WAS ON QUITE A LOT AS A SEAMAN IT'S ROUGH BECAUSE AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN ALL THE TIME BEING A DESTROYER YOU'RE ALMOST A SUBMARINE AT TIMES THE HALL OF THE SEA COMES UP OVER YOU AND YOU GET KNOCKED BACK AGAINST THE SEARCH LIGHT AND IT WAS VERY DAMP THAT IS VERY ROUGH UNCOMFORTABLE AND THIS IS WHAT DO YOU GET USED TO YOU USED TO WEAR A SPECIAL SUIT WHICH COVERED YOU COMPLETELY YOUR WATERPROOF SUIT WITH CAPE LINING BUT EVEN EVEN THAT THE WATER GO ALL THE WAY DOWN AND YOU GOT SOAKING WET I REMEMBER COMING OFF WATCH ON ONE OCCASION LIKE THIS BECAUSE NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO CLIMB BACK DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE LADDERS OF THE SHIP BECAUSE THE DOORS THAT YOU WOULD GO IN AND OUT IN PORT ARE OPEN WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA THOSE DOORS WILL BE CLOSED BECAUSE THE WATER COMES IN THOSE SO YOU HAVE TO CLIMB DOWN LADDERS DOWN THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP NOT NOT OUTSIDE IN THE SEA BUT CLIMB DOWN FROM THE TOP DECK TO THE DECK AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL THE WAVING IT HITS YOU YOU CAN GET WASHED AWAY SO HOLD ON VERY TIGHT WELL THIS WAS THE MIDDLE WATCH THAT I CAN RECALL WHICH IS FROM TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING OR TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BUT YOU'RE NOT ON WATCH LOOKOUT ALL THAT TIME OF THE FOUR HOUR WATCH YOU DO DEFINITE JOBS HALF HOUR ON LOOKOUT HALF HOUR PERHAPS ON THE RADAR SET HALF HOUR ONE HALF HOUR BEHIND A GUN WHERE THERE'S A YOU BECOME PART OF THE GUN CREW SO IF YOU DID HAVE TO GO INTO ACTION YOU WOULD DO THE SHOOTING WHILE THE REAL GUN CREW IS CALLED UP TO TAKE OVER FROM THE WELL ON THIS OCCASION IT HAS BEEN VERY WET OUTSIDE I GOT SOAKED IN AND RETIRED I SAY MIDDLE WATCH PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK I'D COME DOWN I WENT DOWN TO MY MESS DECK WHICH IS IN THE FORCE IT WAS A ROUGH PART OF THE SHIP I HADN'T SLUNG MY HAMMOCK I'D SLEPT ON THE CUSHIONS THIS TIME I DIDN'T FANCY SLEEPING ON THE CUSHIONS BECAUSE THE SHIP WAS GOING TOO MUCH THIS WAY AND I KNEW I'D COME OFF THE CUSHIONS SO I GOT DOWN UNDER THE MESS TABLE THERE'S ABOUT THAT MUCH WATER ON THE FLOOR THE DECK OR NOT THE FLOOR ON THE DECK ABOUT THAT MUCH SO I GOT ALL MY CLOTHES ON THIS SUIT AS YOU CALLED IT AND EVERYTHING AND I'M LAYING DOWN OFF TO SLEEP STRAIGHT AWAY NEXT THING I KNOW A FOOT A TOUCH ME AND I OPENED MY BLEARY EYES AND THERE WAS THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH AND THE LEADING SEAMAN OF THE MESS AND HE WAS SAYING TO ME I'M TOLD THIS IN THE MORNING BY THE LEADING HAND OF THE MESS HE SAID THE OFFICER SAID YOU COME ON SEAMAN YOU CAN'T SLEEP UNDER THERE IT'S TOO WET AND I SAID AND HE LOOKED AT THE LEADING HAND AND SAID WHAT DID HE SAY AND THE MAN I DON'T KNOW I DON'T READ THAT LANGUAGE AND SO OH WELL YOU'D BETTER LET HIM SLEEP THERE AND HE LEFT ME THERE NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT IT TO WELL YOU'RE LYING IN THAT MUCH WATER THE DECKS OF THE SHIPS WERE INSIDE YOU KNOW INSIDE YOUR MESS DECK THE WATER JUST IT'S ONE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE AND A LITTLE BIT WARMER INSIDE SO YOU GOT ALL HUMIDITY THE WATER RUNS DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE DECKS ANY TIME YOU'RE ON THE CAVALIER YOU HAVE A LOOK THE INSIDE BECAUSE YOUR METAL WORK OF THE SHIP'S SIDE IT'S ONLY ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH NO THICKER THAN THAT AND SO THERE THEY ALWAYS YOU GOT WATER MOST OF THE TIME ON YOUR MESS DECKS WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA AND YOU'RE IN HARBOUR YOU NOT TOO BAD SO IT GETS A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE THERE WAS ANOTHER TIME WHEN WE WORKED WITH THE QUEEN MARY AND WE HAD TO PICK HER UP TO BRING HER IN WE WENT OUT AND IT WAS IN ONE OF THE ROUGHEST STORMS WE HAD ABOUT THREE REALLY ROUGH STORMS IN THE PERIOD WE WERE WORKING IN THE ATLANTIC AND WE HAD TO AT THIS TIME IT WOULD BE ABOUT MARCH NINETEEN FORTY FIVE WE HAD TO GO AND PICK UP THE QUEEN MARY NOW THE STORM HAD BEEN RAGING ALL THE WAY FROM AMERICA AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE THE BIG STORM THAT HAD COME ACROSS OUR WAY AND THE QUEEN MARY HAD BROUGHT IT WITH US SORT OF THING AND WE PICKED HER UP AND I THINK WE WERE A DAY OR MORE WAITING TO PICK HER UP BECAUSE EVEN SHE HAD BEEN HELD UP BY THE BAD STORMS WELL WE AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAS THE SISTER SHIP AT THAT TIME BUT WE GOT REALLY BENT UP WE LOST A MOTORBOAT WE LOST ONE OF THE ERM WHALERS M AND WE GOT REALLY KNOCKED ABOUT AND WHEN WE GOT TOWARDS THE CLYDE THE THE QUEEN MARY KNOWING IT WAS IN THE AREA THERE WOULD BE U BOATS HAD TO RELY ON HER SPEED COULD BE A BIT SO AS WE GOT WITHIN HAILING DISTANCE I SUPPOSE SAY THE CLYDE AND THE QUEEN MARY DECIDED SHE COULDN'T SLOW DOWN TO KEEP UP WITH US BECAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH FOR US WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER AND SO SHE JUST FLASHED A MESSAGE SEE YOU IN THE CLYDE THAT AND SHE KEPT UP HER SPEED AND GOT INTO THE CLYDE NOW SHE HAD THE WHOLE OF THE FRONT OF HER BRIDGE STOVED IN AND IT WAS A BIG SHIP WELL UP IN THE AIR THEY HAD A LOT OF CASUALTIES BECAUSE THEY'RE CARRYING ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND TROOPS AND THIS WAS NOW LATE AT NIGHT I THINK ABOUT EM EVEN AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT BUT ANYWAY SHE GOT INTO THE CLYDE WITHOUT ANYTHING DAMAGE FROM THE SEA WE LIMPED IN LATER ON NOW WHEN THE CLYDE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ANCHOR AND WE COULDN'T GO FURTHER INTO GREENOCK TO GREENOCK BECAUSE AFTER THAT YOU GO THROUGH THE BOOM AND THE BOOM IS CLOSED AT NIGHT UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO OPEN THE BOOM WHICH PREVENTS OR HELPS TO PREVENT ANY U BOATS GETTING AT THAT POINT SO AT THE OTHER SIDE WHERE WE HAD TO TIE UP TO A BOY WE HAVE TWO BOY JUMPERS TO TIE UP TO A BOY YOU HAVE TO STOP AND YOU HAVE TO LOWER YOUR WHALE WITH A BOY JUMPER AND THE ROWERS IN IT TO TAKE YOU TO THE BOY WITH THE CHAIN TO CLIP IT TO THE BOY WELL IF I'VE GIVEN YOU A PICTURE OF HOW ROUGH THE STORM WAS IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT FIRST WHALE WE UM AND LET DOWN ONTO THE WATER MANAGED TO GET DOWN SAFELY BUT GOT WASHED AWAY WITH A CREW IN IT FURTHER DOWN THE CLYDE THAT WAS AWAY FOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO LOWER ANOTHER WHALER ALL OF US WAS UP ON THE FOR ALL THE SEAMAN THAT COULD HELP WAS UP ON THE FORCE AND BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE YOUR ANCHOR YOU'RE JUST USING THE ANCHOR CHAIN WHICH GOES WITH A WIRE ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE ANCHOR CHAIN AND THE WHALER HAD TO TAKE THIS WIRE TO THE BOY TO CLAMP IT ONTO THE BOY AND THEN THE BOY PULLED BY THE ANCHOR CHAIN NEARER THE SHIP SO THEY CLIP IT ON SO ANYWAY THEY LOWERED THE SECOND WHALER THE BOY CAME MANAGED TO GET ONTO THE BOY AND IN DOING SO BROKE HIS WRIST AND IN THE END AFTER I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO CLIP UP TO THE BOY AND THE ER CAPTAIN SAID TOPS ALL AROUND I HATED THE SMELL OF RUM ANYWAY AND NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD MY TOP BECAUSE IT'S HORRIBLE BUT I HAD IT THAT NIGHT BECAUSE WE WERE FROZEN FROZEN STIFF AND WHEN LAND USE TO GET AWAY WITH IT BUT NOTHING WAS EVER SAID ABOUT THIS TYPE OF THING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH PEOPLE AT THE PORT KNEW THESE BIG SHIPS COME COME IN IT WAS NOT A THING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THE GERMANS ALSO KNEW THAT THEY WERE BRINGING ALL THESE LARGE NUMBERS BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS THAT COULD CARRY AND MANY OF THE U BOAT CAPTAINS I UNDERSTAND AND THIS IS NORMAL KNOWLEDGE WERE OFFERED A LARGE SUM OF MONEY THOUSANDS OF WHAT THEY THAN FOR A DARK THOUSANDS TO MARK AND THE HIGHEST OF THE OF HONOURS TO HAVE KNOCKED DOWN ANY ONE OF THESE MONSTERS BUT WE NEVER LOST ONE FORTUNATELY I'M HAPPY TO SAY BUT THE QUEEN MARY WAS REALLY BATTERED VERY BADLY BATTERED HOW WE DIDN'T GET TURNED OVER I'VE GOT NO IDEA WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BIG SEAS WHAT SORT OF SIZE YOU TOOK WELL IF YOU THE SEAS ITSELF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL IT'S GENERALLY KNOWN THAT SOME OF THE WAVES WERE SIXTY FOOT HIGH NOW IF YOU THINK OF SIXTY GOING UP THAT WAY WHEN YOU GO UP TO THE WAVE AND YOU COME DOWN TO THE TROUGH YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOOT AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN CUT THROUGH THOSE WAVES AND THE BIG SHIPS OR THE SMALL SHIPS YOU ACTUALLY GO UP ON THAT WAVE AND THEN YOU FEEL IT AS YOU COME DOWN WITH A CRUNCH LIKE THAT AND THEN YOU UP TO THE NEXT ONE AND ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CORK SCREWING YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT STILL AND YOU GET USED TO THIS AFTER THE FIRST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE YOU GOT BRUISES ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE YOU GO THROUGH NORMAL OR FLATS THEY'RE CALLED ON A DESTROYER THE NORMAL CORRIDOR ON THE FLOOR ON A AND DESTROYER WHICH IS ABOUT THAT WIDE WELL WHEN YOU FIRST GO ABOARD ONE LIKE THAT AND IT WAS FAIRLY CALM WHEN YOU SET OUT FOR SCAPA FROM GREENOCK BUT AS YOU WALK ALONG THE DECK COMES UP TO MEET YOU AND IT GOES UP AND YOU HIT YOUR FEET AS YOU GO DOWN ON THE DECK BUT BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THAT DECK HAD GONE AWAY AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN AND THIS HITS YOU FROM THE TOP AND THEN WHILE THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING THIS THIS BULK IT HITS YOU AND ACTUAL YOU KNOW THAT BULK IT HITS YOU SO IN TIME YOU LEARN TO WALK LIKE A SAILOR AND IF THE SHIP GOES DOWN YOU GO DOWN WITH IT AND COME UP WITH IT AND THAT'S YOU'LL FIND SAILORS AND WHEN YOU GET ASHORE THEY WORK WITH A ROLL WALK WITH A ROLL THAT IS JUST THAT STILL WALKING ON THE SHIP SO AFTER THE END OF THE WAR RIGHT DAY RIGHT YOU'RE NOT FINISHED YEAH V DAY ITSELF WE WERE THAT'S THE NINTH OF MAY WE WERE BRINGING IN THE OLDER FRANCE AND WE NOTICED THAT THE PEACE HAD BEEN DECLARED FOR THE NEXT DAY WE GOING TO GO INTO GREENOCK SO WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN THE LAST OF THE ONE SHIP CONVOYS BEFORE THE WAR ENDED WE ARRIVED IN GREENOCK I BELIEVE IT OR A WEDNESDAY OR SUNDAY HALF THE SHIP'S COMPANY WAS ALLOWED LEAVE WHICH WASN'T ME ON OR WASN'T ONE OF THE SHIP'S COMPANY BUT THEY WENT ASHORE TO GREENOCK HAD A TERM TIME SO THEN WE STILL CARRIED ON WITH SOME OF THESE CONVOYS AFTER THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS QUITE A FEW OF THE U BOATS THAT APPARENTLY MISSING A LOT OF THEM ONE OR TWO WENT TO BRAZIL OR WHATEVER SO THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE THAT IF THERE WAS A U BOAT AROUND THEY COULD HAVE KNOCKED DOWN SOME OF THE MONSTERS WE WERE STILL BRINGING BACK IN BUT WE HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL BUT TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT ANYWAY WE WERE THEN DESTINED TO GO ACROSS TO THE END TRY TO END THE JAPANESE WAR SO TWO BY TWO OR FLOTILLA WENT IN FOR REFITS WE WENT IN FOR A REFIT LATE IN MAY JUNE BECAUSE WE WERE GOING OUT THERE ANYWAY BUT FORTUNATELY WHILE I WAS ON LEAVE TO GO OUT THERE THE SHIP WAS DOWN AT DEVONPORT BEING REFITTED THE WAR ENDED SO I STILL GOT A TELEGRAM TO SAY DAYS LEAVE EXTRA DAYS LEAVE EXTRA WHEN WE CAME BACK TO THE SHIP WE STILL HAD TO GO OUT THERE BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING TO CLEAR UP AFTER THE WAR WELL THE WHOLE OF OUR FLOTILLA WERE OUT THEN WE WERE THE LAST TWO SO AS WE WENT OUT GIBRALTAR MALTA AID AND PLACES LIKE THAT WE THOUGHT WE WAS IN FOR A LOVELY SUMMER CRUISE BUT THEN WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE NO WHEN WE GOT TO THINK MALE THAT WAS OUR NAVAL BASE WE BASED AT TRINCOMALEE AND WE ALSO BASED AT SINGAPORE AND WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPORE THIS WAS JUST ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THE WAR AND WE WERE CARRYING OUT AN EXERCISE WITH HMS SUSSEX AND ANOTHER SHIP AND THE CAPTAIN THE LA THE FLOTILLA LEADER IT WAS ON HMS CAESAR AND OURSELVES IN CAVALIER WERE ORDERED TO GO WITH THE SUSSEX TO A PROBLEM SO WE IMMEDIATELY WENT AT FULL SPEED WE WERE SENT TO TO JAVA WE STOPPED ON A COUPLE OF TROOP SHIPS ON THE WAY CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT BUT WE TOOK ON BOARD OUR FULL DECK WAS COVERED WITH INDIAN TROOPS ARMED INDIAN TROOPS AND THE CAVALIER WAS THE SAME AND THE CAESAR WAS ALSO AND THE SUSSEX ANCHORED OUTSIDE SURABAYA BECAUSE IT COULDN'T GET IN WE COULD HARDLY GET IN BECAUSE THERE WAS A SUNKEN JAPANESE CRUISER IN THERE IN THE WAY SO CAESAR WENT IN FIRST BECAUSE HE WAS A FLOTILLA LEDER FULL OF TROOPS WE WENT IN SECOND AS WE WERE SECOND AND THEN THE CAVALIER AFTERWARDS AS WE WENT IN IT WAS DAYLIGHT WE HAD ALL HIS TROOPS ON BOARD SO IF WE HAD ANY TROUBLE WE COULDN'T HAVE USED OUR GUNS BECAUSE OF TRUTH LUCKILY WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE FROM THE SHORE BUT AS WE CAME INTO SURABAYA I WAS LOOKING OVER THE SIDE AND THERE WAS BODIES DOZENS OF THEM IN WHITE NAVAL UNIFORMS I THINK THEY WERE PROBABLY DUTCH I DON'T THINK THEY WAS OURS BUT WE WERE SLOWLY MOVING AVOIDING THIS WRECKAGE AND AVOIDING THE BODIES AND YOU GOT TO THE STAGE NOW WHEN WE IN WAR BODIES IN THE WATER MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO YOU YOU ACCEPTED THE FACT THAT THEY WERE BODIES AND DEAD YOU KNOW AND SO ANYWAY YOU MOVED IN WE ANCHORED IN THE DOCK THERE AND ONE BY ONE THE CRUISER DISGORGED HER TROOPS FIRST AND WE CAME IN NEXT SO THE THREE OF US ALL OUR TROOPS WENT ASHORE THE DOCKS HAD BEEN ALREADY TAKEN OVER BY THE U K ARMY I THINK HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN AHEAD AND IT WAS THE INDO INDONESIAN REBELS THAT FIGHTING THEY HAD ALREADY KILLED BRIGADIER MALAY THAT WAS THE ARMY BOSS AND THESE TROOPS WENT ASHORE AND WE STAYED THERE READY FOR A LOT OF SURVIVORS OF THE DUTCH PEOPLE THEY WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS FROM A CAMP RIGHT THE OTHER SIDE OF SURVEYOR AND THERE WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT UNDER AN ESCORT FOR ANOTHER TRUCE SHE BRIGADED MALARIA BEEN KILLED UNDER A TRUCE NOW THIS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DUTCH PEOPLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN MOSTLY IN A CAMP THE OTHER SIDE THERE WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS BY ANOTHER TRUCE UM ARMY TRUCKS AND GUARDED BY INDIAN TROOPS YOU WERE GOING TO BE BROUGHT ACROSS TO US AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM ON BOARD AND WE WERE TO TAKE THEM OUT TO THE TROOPERS WHICH COULDN'T GET INTO THE HARBOUR WELL WE WERE THEN TOLD WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR THESE PEOPLE TO COME ACROSS WE WERE TO GO OUT INTO THE WATER BECAUSE WE MIGHT BE USED WHICH WAS WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY AS IT HAPPENED WHEN THIS CONVOY OF ARMY TRUCKS GUARDED BY INDIAN TROOPS GOT AS FAR AS SURABAYA THEY FOUND THAT THEY WERE STOPPED ALTHOUGH THEY HAD A WHITE FLAG THEY WERE STOPPED BY THE POST OFFICE WHICH WAS FULL OF INDIAN INDONESIAN REBELS THE INDIAN REBELS SET UP TRENCH MORTARS AND MACHINE GUNS AND AS SOON AS THE CONVOY GOT THERE THEY SHOT THE THE TROOPS THAT WERE GUARDING THE CONVOY AND THE CONVOY COME TO A HALT SO WE WERE CALLED IN TO USE OUR FIVE GUNS SO WE HAD TO FIRE ON THE TOWN AND WE TOOK OUT THE POST OFFICE WITH THE INDONESIAN TROOPS IN IT AND THEN THE CONVOY COME THROUGH WE WENT BACK INTO HARBOUR AND WE HAD ALL THE DUTCH PEOPLE ON BOARD AND WE TOOK THEM OUT TO SAY SO WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T PERSONALLY HAVE TO GO ASHORE I HAD TO GO ASHORE LATER ON TO GUARD SOME OF THE WAREHOUSES AND SO ON BUT WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO ANY FIGHTING THE ONLY FIGHTING WE HAD TO DO WAS FIRING A GUN BECAUSE I WAS ON THE UPPER DECK AT THE TIME WHEN WE WERE CALLED IN TO FIRE AND I WAS CALLED OFF THE UPPER DECK TO FIRE UM MY GUN AND I SAID I'M NOT GUNNER THEY SAID YOU ARE TODAY SO THEY PUT ME ON THE M ON THE GUN GUNNERY AND ANOTHER ONE AND WE HAD TO FIRE TO THE DIRECTION OF A SPOTTER PLANE THAT WAS SENT UP BY THE ARMY ARMY SENT SPOTTER PLANE AND APPARENTLY WE TOOK OUT THE POST OFFICE SO HAD THE GOOD DEED WAS DONE FOR THE DAY WE DID HAVE THEM INBOARD OVERNIGHT A LOT OF THESE DUTCH PEOPLE WE LOCATED ALL THE FOREIGN MESS DECKS AND HAD TO SLEEP DOWN AFT ON THE UPPER DECK IN DIFFERENT PLACES AND THE DUTCH PEOPLE WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THE FRONT THERE UNTIL WE TOOK THEM OUT TO THE THE OTHER SHIPS THAT AND THEN WE GOT OUR PLACED BACK ON LOST A PAIR OF SAND OR THEY DISAPPEARED HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU'RE SAILING INTO HARBOUR THERE AND YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF NAVAL PEOPLE WELL YOU'RE YOU'RE APPREHENSIVE TO START WITH BUT AT THE AGE YOU ARE YOU'RE VERY SELDOM FRIGHTENED ERM I SUPPOSE YOU WERE IN A DRUG OF AND COMES BACK LATER ON AND YOU THINK TO YOURSELF WELL I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED THERE YOU KNOW BUT I WASN'T AND THAT'S HOW YOU TOOK IT IF YOU COULDN'T EM IF YOU HAD IF YOU THOUGHT OF ALL THESE THINGS AT THE TIME YOU'D BE A NERVOUS WRECK BUT YOU'RE EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD AND I WERE NINETEEN YEARS OLD AND ANYTHING HAPPENED AND FORTUNATELY YOU ACCEPT IT IT'S NOT FEAR SOMETIMES I THINK BACK NOW AND SAY WELL I COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED THERE BUT I'M NOT I'M HERE SO WE ACCEPT IT AS JUST A FACT OF LIFE IT WAS EXCITING I MEAN IT'S QUITE A YOU KNOW QUITE A BIG WAY TO END THE WAR TO END YOUR NAVAL SERVICE REALLY ISN'T IT TO BE INVOLVED IN YOU KNOW CONTACT LIKE THAT IT'S NICE TO BE AT THIS STAGE AND KNOW THAT YOU'VE DONE CERTAIN JOBS WHERE INSTEAD OF WELL WE MUST HAVE KILLED PEOPLE BY BY TAKING OUT THE THE POST OFFICE BUT YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM AND AND YOU KNOW BY DOING THAT YOU HELPED TO SAVE HELPED TO SAVE THE LOSS OF PERHAPS AND EVEN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE AND I HAD THE SAME FEELING ABOUT WHEN WE WERE ESCORTING THE TROOPERS THE FACT THAT WE NEVER KNEW WHETHER WE HAD SUNK A SUBMARINE A U BOAT BECAUSE WE NEVER STAYED LONG ENOUGH ALL WE COULD DO WAS DEPTH CHARGE A TARGET IF THAT TARGET WAS A U BOAT THEN WE MIGHT HAVE SUNK IT OR IT MIGHT HAVE GOT AWAY BUT OUR REAL JOB WAS TO LOOK AFTER A SHIP COMING IN WITH FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS AND AS LONG AS WE SAVED THAT I'M HAPPY BUT YOU NEVER KNOW I JUST HOPE WE DIDN'T I JUST HOPE THAT THERE WASN'T A U BOAT THERE AND THAT THE PEOPLE WEREN'T KILLED THEY WERE ONLY DOING THE SORT OF THING THAT WE WERE DOING AND THAT WAS A JOB
