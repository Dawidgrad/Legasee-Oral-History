my name is john douglas woodward i'm eighty nine years old i was born on the seventh april nineteen twenty four when in the service i had originally joined to be a signaller and they found out i was colour blind so i was automatically transferred to a the a stewarding branch which i didn't want but you had no choice you did what you were told and i got transferred to minesweepers and i was based on the isle of sheppey at queenborough queensland queenborough pier and we had about ten minesweepers there we went out every couple days to sweep any mines that had been dropped by boats in the hope of sinking our supply ships why did you join the navy because i wanted to get in the fight i didn't want to be left behind at the time i was what they call in the reserved occupation i was an apprentice as an electrical engineer and my dad didn't want me to to join up he was in the last war and he would've preferred me to learn a good steady trade but i wanted to go so as soon as i was eighteen i went over from maidstone where our home was i came over to chatham to pembroke barracks and signed up i said i was nineteen but it didn't matter because they just accepted you if you could breathe in and out and move your arms you were physically fit i was told to go home and wait and i'd be contacted and about a week later the envelope came report to chatham barracks on such and such a day i went right through the war without actually seeing the german we had long range fights with them but we never actually saw a german but john you wanted to do your bit but why did you not join the army or the raf i'm not interested in either and it's traditional in my family my father was in the navy so was my grandfather and an uncle my grandfather was on beatty's flagship the lion at the battle of jutland and he didn't come on deck for three days he was in the engineering branch but that's the service i wanted to join so i did and what do you remember of your training it's rather confuse when you're young you don't take things in so easily but from pembroke house pembroke barracks we were all marched down to the a further down the yard where we got fitted out and at that time everyone unless they were an officer wore the same four and a rig with bell bottoms the scarf and the and the a the hat sent up to skegness with another bunch to butlins holiday camp and that became hms royal arthur and i was to start training as a telegraphist signaller and i been doing morse code started on the morse code for about a fortnight then somebody said ooh this lot haven't had a a colour test they'd better have it ' most of them passed but two others and me were all strongly colour blind so you're out if you send the wrong colours when you're signalling it could be a disaster so that's when i was transferred onto minesweepers on the stewarding branch were you disappointed yes nobody liked being on minesweepers we all kept putting in for transfer to something more glamorous destroyers submarines mtb's mgb's but always got turned down you're doing an important job you will stay put ' and that was it how many people on one of these minesweepers how what was the ship the boat like five officers and about twelve to fifteen crew that includes the the engineers or the stoker branch as they call it signalling and and those doing the actual mine detecting when we first started and went out minesweeping it was three days on one day off and we had two seamen standing in the bows with rifles when they saw a mine that was floating by they'd shoot at it hit the holes and blow it up but that was when they started the minesweeping campaign and they the germans when they dropped them had long weights on wires so they just floated below the surface to hit the ship if one of those wires came loose the mime would bob onto the surface and that's one of the things we looked for each time we went out when the germans occupied france they course got right on the coastline and they had big guns and the and they used to pop away at us every time we came out and fortunately we never got hit there was one amusing anecdote our commodore had been a senior captain before the war and he retired of course and he was brought back in and made commodore of the minesweeping fleet he had his twelve minesweepers and we used to go out and do the same thing every day the germans being very meticulous would come out we'll say friday's and tuesday's not only the same day but the same time to lay their mines and then dash back in we went out the following morning each time to pick them up and the skipper got a bit fed up with this and he told the conference of his captains one day he said next time we go sweeping run your trawls out but don't drop any wires ' which is of course contrary to all naval instruction and you could have got a court martial if anything happened but we went through the german minefield as they'd laid it and we got away with it so the germans came out again to replace the mines they thought we'd picked up and they lost four of their own boats on their own mines and i don't think they thought that was very sporting when we went out i was due to report with six other stewards we reported to the first lieutenant we're damage control party if the ship got hit we had to clear the damage away put out any fires and pull the wounded into the war room where the doctor was waiting to do what he could but fortunately it never happened but that was my official station and what about bad weather and storms and stuff did you ever encounter any dangers oh we had some yes but we still went out you just put on your and that was it we had safety lines rigged fore and aft so you hold onto those you wouldn't get washed overboard what was it like watching the planes taking going over you and stuff did you see much activity in the air we went fortunately we never got attacked from the air i don't think the the germans thought our little boats were worth wasting a bomb on they wanted them for the capital cities or the airfields were you involved in d day at all yes now a week before d day the base was shut down like an oyster nobody could go off duty and no one was allowed in for security reasons obviously you couldn't get any post you couldn't make any phone calls because it was coming up although officially we didn't know that and for about three months before d day on admiralty instructions we'd started night sweeping as an alternative to the day shift so the germans would get used to the idea of us popping along the coast during the hours of darkness they wouldn't think anything of it so the early morning of d day we went out at midnight and we were sweeping right up to the line where the battleships were waiting to bombard the coast we knew exactly where they were going to be stationed and we swept that most carefully and then we as they started coming out of the darkness from two o'clock in the morning and waiting and we retired behind them there wasn't anything else for us to do we got sent back here to the the isle of sheppey when the troops went ashore we were a bit annoyed because we weren't doing anything and then about eight or nine days later we got the orders to patrol the dutch coast on the and pick up all the mines which the germans had so liberally round all the coast there so that kept us busy for about three weeks and we were stationed at a little town called terneuzen a very small port but there was a long jetty so we could moor alongside there and in the evenings late afternoon you got shore leave until you were going off again next morning and i've never forgotten the things we saw when we went ashore the germans had got out in a hurry and their their signs were everywhere on the hotel lounge that had been an officers' mess and the signs were still up and they'd blew some of the bridges over the canals as they left and the dutch flooded some of the to stop their heavy traffic getting away and i remember once we went ashore and we all carried the navy raincoat draped over your arm folded in a certain way and the officer watching you very well with your things in the pockets cigarettes packet of biscuits a tin of jam or whatever which were not supposed to be taken off the ship and we were giving it to the dutch civilians because they were as starved as hell and looked very ill and on this occasion we got ashore and i i saw a very thin haggard looking woman coming up the street pushing her battered pram and she got two little kids in there about three or a bit less i suppose and one blanket cover them and i good day ' and she gave me a smile she couldn't speak english and i couldn't speak dutch but i took out what i had and i put it in her pram you should've seen the look on her face she must've thought it was christmas come twice because what they didn't eat they could always trade for something else after we got rid of most of the mines off the dutch coast we had a week's leave due well obviously we weren't coming back here for it it would be on the dutch coast and i and another fellow we got along to the main road which was the brussels road leading into into belgium we thumbed lifts from army lorries which were always going up and down and we got into about three three hours no a bit less into bruges which was one of the most beautiful cities i've seen it's got two cathedrals an opera house and the town hall round four sides of the main square and the one of the hotels had been taken over as a for the troops bed and breakfast so we stayed there and we enjoyed ourselves and when we came back we got ordered back to this country and we were still looking for mines which might have escaped detection be going up and down but there wasn't much urgency in it anymore and i did put in an application to sit for leading steward but before that could take place my discharge papers came through and that was in the early early nineteen forty six after the war yeah but unlike the army or the air force we got plenty of notice when it was coming i know people in the air force and they were given three days' notice and then they were out but in the navy we had time you were told you would be demobbed in three months well that gives you time to start looking round for a civilian job or somewhere to live if you're married with kids so i think we had a better deal can you explain you you talk about this minesweeping just explain what you were doing and what happens to these mines well they looked like yard zips from the main masts stretched out either side about fifty feet and from these are very sharp cutting wires with weights on the end and as you go to the water the idea is to your cutting wires to catch the mooring wires for a mine and you cut it and the mine comes to the surface and you dispose of it how many mines would you find on an average day on an average day possibly a dozen possibly only two it varied and the disposal would be a shot would it or that's what it started with yes then the germans eventually the acoustic mine which wasn't it was just dropped in the channel hopefully in the path of oncoming ships and it emitted a magnetic field from batteries that were inside and every ship as it goes also makes a magnetic field and when the two collide the mine goes up so we had to have what was called degaussing equipment a special coil fitted right round the ship allowing currents to pass through that anticlockwise and that nullifies the effect of the electronic field and you could go over mines and you'd be alright could you find those mines we found them yes how sometimes the germans got crass and they dropped some of these mines at night from low flying planes and we got back i wasn't there i was at on a couple days leave and i went home to maidstone but i was told our squadron came back from patrol and the last ship in slid into its place on the jetty and promptly blew up because there was a mine underneath been dropped by a plane and the skipper at this last boat as a result of being six feet from the jetty he got his degaussing equipment switched off i think there was two survivors but who they were i don't know but how would you find i can understand how you could find a mine that was floating in the water you cut it and it floats to the surface how did you find those magnetic mines were they on the bottom or they're on the bottom yes how would you find that well with like a sonar device it picks up the radiations from the mine and you can see exactly where it is and then you can drop a depth charge on it you set the depth charge for twenty feet or thirty whatever it is and just pop them over to the side on a y gun in holland when you got to holland you talked a little bit about what you saw are there any other memories of just the devastation when the germans got out in a hurry they took everyone with them alive or dead and blew a couple of bridges and then retreated towards belgium did you feel like you were winning the war at that stage yes the great day had come the invasion had started and we were pushing in land from the beaches we hadn't been shucked back off again and it was starting to to bite when you were pulled out of d day did you were you were you able to hear what was going on on d day after the battleships have arrived you've come back to base did you were you around long enough to hear about the guns going off the when the main broadside started yes i think that was quarter to six and eight miles of ships all opened up at the same time we already got information from the underground the resistant workers where the german strongpoints were all along the cliff tops heavy gun emplacements bunkers for troops and so on and they got continuous plastering and they hadn't quite finished it was a two hour bombardment and half an hour before it stopped the boats were going ashore with the troops did you hear it we were on the minesweepers behind them we heard it alright it was such a deafening crescendo of noise there's nothing like it you weren't even near it no do you remember ve day oh that was again marvellous i was awaiting demob and of course we got rather more leave once peace was declared and i got i think it was a four day pass to go home to maidstone and we came up on the train to victoria and the place was just one seething mass of people every colour every uniform everything you could think of everyone was singing dancing laughing with complete strangers because they let their hair down and in front of buckingham palace you couldn't got a shoehorn in there were hundreds of thousands stretching back down the mall waiting for the king queen and winston to come on the balcony and the roar that went out must've gone on for about ten fifteen minutes non stop how do you reflect on your navy service now i'm glad i'm glad i went means i and thousands of others don't have to read about history we were making it we were part of that history and i think it's something to be proud of are there any other stories you want to share i don't think there's any no as i say minesweeping is a very dull occupation with occasional short periods of activity but unlike destroyers or battleships you you're not engaged permanently with the opposite number were there any occasions where you were engaged no we were never attacked by planes as i said and we didn't see any german troops the only contact we had was when their long range guns on the french coast tried to get us while we were minesweeping but they they didn't what is said
