what did you do to keep yourself happy how easy was it to be a happy sailor when you were in these situations do you get tough to it well it depends on what you want to do i mean we were four as cadets we were four in together when i was third officer i had my own cabin then i used to take a portable type writer to learn how to type you know and write letters and things like that and then we had a library on board you'd read books and you couldn't get the radio you couldn't transmit but in the radio cabin they had one radio that could listen into the news and we got the news sometimes we didn't always get it and you couldn't listen in we had no tape recorders in those days the gramophones were the old wind up ones you know people used to play cards and things like that you know and sit on deck on a nice day and read a book that was very very wonderful you know when the weather was fine did i ask you about burial at sea did you ever have any yes we did yes we were actually scared of yellow fever and so before we left port we were given injections against yellow fever but one of the people got it it was a cook actually he got yellow fever from the injection and we had no doctor on board and there was nowhere else we could go and he died so we were on our own we weren't in convoy then so we had the burial it was very impressive the ship was stopped now traditionally the corpse was put in canvas and you put weights at the bottom old iron bars or coal or something like that and you sewed the corpse up this job was done by the boatswain and the carpenter that was the tradition and the last stitch was taken through the nose to make sure he was really dead then there was a hatch board on the of the ship with a flag over it the body was underneath it was called the snatching back of the ensign' then the captain would come down and the crew would assemble and we had prayers and committals and there was a proper sort of form for this and then at the appropriate moment the captain would give the signal and the seamen would hold onto the flag lift up the hatch board and the body would slide out into the sea it was very nice and that was a burial at sea it was the only one that we had the other one in the lifeboat we didn't have any we just said prayers and we put the body over we couldn't sew it up or anything are there any other stories that you would like to share about your naval time well there's rather an amusing one now when we were cadets there were four cadets and the senior one now the third officer got sick so we had to leave him ashore and the senior cadet was promoted to acting third officer he was a good friend of mine so we were then three in our cabin and he had a special cabin on his own but on one particular occasion i was painting outside you had to paint the ship every three months and i was painting along there and he had his feet sticking out of the port hole you see i couldn't resist the temptation so i painted his feet grey of course he was very senior to me but he was a good friend of mine so he rushed out with the paint pot and between us we both got covered in grey paint now his wife got in touch with me and she remembered that incident because he told her he died a few years ago but she's been in touch with me through this broadcast and she remembered that that was a very amusing incident she was actually in detroit by then she was a passenger we had from malta to the united states and he was quite young i used to chat with her and she was quite alone i went to see her family in detroit when we were in new york and we kept up a correspondence we weren't very close but it was a sort of you know that kind of relationship i remember in new york another rather interesting observation we were invited to the stork club which was very famous in those days for actors and people like that you know and several members of the crew went in and we were given a standing welcome by the people there they were singing rule britannia and so on you know it was very very nice and then one of the guys there said he would take us to meet shirley temple but he never did but we were given quite a lot of honours if you like one of the other rather sad ones was a young man named gilchrist who was with me on one of my trips and the next trip he went on a different ship and nothing was heard of it it was actually torpedoed and it was in a storm and eventually i've got the details in my memoirs i went to see his family in ireland they lived in arden glas actually to make my commiserations you know because it was very very sad when you know someone and you know the people there so that was another incident actually but that was completely different from the funny one do you remember the end of the war did you know the end of the war was coming did you sense it well you see we had very little news and we were in the indian ocean when the final end of the war against japan we heard about it on the radio then but you know we didn't know much of what was going on in north africa or in germany or so on we didn't get much news and we were a long way away some trips were very long nine and ten months sometimes you'd be away all that time and letters would be censored you couldn't say where you were and you had to send them to the main post office you see and they would forward them then letters we had received had to be sent to the main gp office and they would put them to the admiralty who knew where the ship was and send them out you know so it was hit and miss to an extent you didn't get much information was there a celebration on board yes we had a celebration there was some wine and things like that you know we usually had a bit of a christmas party on ships as well if we could and we'd have christmas pudding and things like that you know but there were limits on drink i mean they were very very strict on drink fortunately you didn't want people to be drunk half the time so you had a bar but you couldn't have an unlimited supply but cigarettes were dirt cheap of course so everybody was smoking i had to give that up later on
