I SERVED FROM NINETEEN FORTY ONE TO NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND BASICALLY AND WESTERN APPROACHES THAT INCLUDES AT PLYMOUTH RIGHT THE WAY UP RIGHT WAY UP TO SCOTLAND TOP OF SCOTLAND THAT WAS YOUR NAME JOAN FIELD I WAS JOAN ROSE IN WHAT WERE YOU FROM WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO YOU WELL I ACTUALLY WAS BORN IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE AND A LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED MELDRES INNER I THINK IT WAS FIFTEENTH CENTURY THATCHED COTTAGE WHICH MY GRANDMOTHER'S SMALL HOLDING I WAS BORN THERE AND MY PARENTS WORKED ON THE SMALL HOLDING AND IN NINETEEN THIRTY SIX THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR WE MOVED TO A NEW TOWN OF WELDING CITY WHERE MY FATHER THEN GOT EMPLOYMENT AND I LIVED THERE AND WENT TO SCHOOL THERE AND I WON A SCHOLARSHIP IN ADVERSARY TO SHARES IN HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS IN WELDING ON CITY AND I MATRICULATED AT WHICH WAS THEN CALLED A MATRICULATION I WAS THEN SEVENTEEN AND I WANTED TO JOIN THE THE WAR HAD BROKEN OUT BY THEM OBVIOUSLY I WANTED TO JOIN THE WRENS I WENT DOWN AND THOUGHT WHILE I HOPE HOPE TO GETTING THE WRENS IF NOT I'LL HAVE TO GO INTO THE WAR BUT THEY ACCEPTED ME INTO THE WRENS THE TIME THEY WERE ONLY ON TAKING ON COOKS AND STEWARDS WHICH OF COURSE I DID NOT WANT TO DO AND I HAD AN EYE TEST THEY DECIDED I GOT PERFECT EYESIGHT THEN AND SO I WAS TOLD I WAS GOING TO BE A SIGNAL I DIDN'T MEAN MUCH TO ME BUT I DIDN'T MIND WHAT IT WAS AND I WAS CALLED UP JUST A MONTH BEFORE CHRISTMAS TO S CABLE WHICH IS UP IN WARRINGTON WAS JUST TRYING TO THINK NINETY I THINK HE WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE BEGINNING MEN OF NINETEEN FORTY ONE AND I THOUGHT THIS IS MARVELOUS ALL THE OFFICES AT CHRISTMAS WERE WAITING OR I THOUGHT IS A LOVELY IDEA THIS IS BECAUSE I WAS SHORT IT WAS VERY TOUGH OR CABLE AND YOU WERE GIVEN TWO WEEKS FOR WHAT THEY CALL PROBATION AND YOU WERE GIVEN ALL THE DIRTY JOBS TO DO OVAL SCRUBBING THE FLOORS CLEAN AND LOSE IT WAS MAKE ALL BREAK TIME REALLY TO SQUADRILLY UNTIL SQUADROL OH I HATED SQUADRL BUT I GOT TO LOVE ACTUALLY AFTER THAT BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY AND AND AT THE END OF THE FORTNIGHT AND WE WERE ACCEPTED SOME OF THEM WENT HOME SOME OF THEM WHEN A WALL IF YOU WENT A WELL THEN YOU JUST WENT INTO MUNITIONS OR WHATEVER IF YOU DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT PERHAPS THE WHAT WOULD HAVE HAD YOU WE WERE FIRST CHOICE IN THOSE DAYS EVERYBODY WANTED TO GO IN THE RUNS AND SO I STARTED MY OFFICIAL SIGNALLING AND CODING I DID SOME CODING AS WELL BUT WE BASICALLY IS YOUR SIGNALLING AND ON THE COURSE LASTED I THINK FOR SIX MONTHS YES HE WAS ABOUT SIX MONTHS FOUR MONTANO FOUR MONTHS FOUR MONTHS I THINK AND AT THAT TIME AFTER THAT TIME YOU WENT ON LEAVE YOU AND THEN DRAUGHT IN DIFFERENT PLACES WHERE ALL PORTS PUT DOWN FOR PLYMOUTH ALL WANTED TO COME SOUTH AND BECAUSE I DID LIVE THEN IN WHEN IN ONE CITY OBVIOUSLY IT SO THE SOUTH I WANTED I ENDED UP IN OPEN AND NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT HAD TO FIND IT ON THE MAP WHEN I GOT THE DRAUGHT I DIDN'T WHERE IT WAS FOUND IT AND I THOUGHT THIS IS LOVELY IT HAD TO BE LOVELY UP THERE I JUST JUST GOING VACATE IT WE YOU YOU SO THAT YOU IN FANCY THAT YOU WANTED TO JOIN THE RAINS AND THE OTHER SO IS WHY I DON'T KNOW AND I'VE GOT NO NAVEL OR MY MY FATHER AND MY GRANDFATHER ALL SERVED IN THE ARMY AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS AS I LOVE TO SEE AND MAYBE THE UNIFORM IS A BIG AND I DO I READ DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE IN THE RENTS IT WAS JUST SOMETHING I THINK STEPHANIE HAD THE SAME WHEN YOU READ HER BOOK AND IS AN ATTRACTION TO IT AND I SUPPOSE IN A WAY IT'S A SORT OF GLAMOUR OF THE RENT NOW YOU MENTION CAB AND HE MENTIONS IN A VISE VISION SHIP UTILIZATION AND CODING BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT WHAT YOU WERE LEARNING AND HOW YOU LEARN TO VISUALIZATION AND WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WAS THE PROCESS AND WELL FIRST OF ALL YOU GOT TO GO IN THE MORSE CODE AND EVEN AT SEVENTEEN THAT'S A BIT TRICKY BUT STILL YOU LEARN THE MORSE CODE AND AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY DRUMMED INTO ONE MORSE CODE AND IS IT PURELY REPOSITION YES REALLY AND TRULY AND YOU LEARN GIMMICKS TO LEARN IT YOU KNOW OF A D D DE DAD YOU KNOW OF FACE YOU KNOW YOU DO AND ALL THESE SORT OF GIMMICKY THINGS TO REMIND YOU AND IS TOUGH WE WERE ALL PUT INTO CLASSES AND THE VISUAL SIGNALS AS CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH A V AND MY CLASS WAS VERITY AND I CAN'T RED WHAT STEPNEYSCLASS IS WHICH HE DOES MENTION IN THE BOOK THE WILDEST TELEGRAPHERS CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH W LIKE WAR SPITE AND THE CODING CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH A SIN AND EACH COURT CLASS WAS A DIFFERENT LENGTHS AND WE LEARNED MORSE CODE SEMAPHORE AND TO SIGNAL WITH FLAGS YOU KNOW LIKE THE OLD NELSON SIGNAL WHICH KEPT CHANGING LEARNING THE PHONETIC ALPHABET WHICH HALF WAY THROUGH OUR COURSE CHANGED SO THAT AMERICANS COULD UNDERSTAND IT WHICH ANNOYED ASKED WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO CHANGE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS ANYWAY SO THE PHONETIC ALPHABET AND EVERY CLASS WAS MANNED BY AN EX SERVING MAN USUALLY A CHIEF WHO'D NEVER DEALT WITH BEFORE AND SOME OF THEM WERE BIT TOUGH BIT OFF BUT ON WE NEEDED IT BECAUSE WE WERE COMPLETELY ROAR TO IT ALL WE HAD ONLY WE TALK NAVAL DISCIPLINE AND DIFFERENT TIME WATCHES YOU KNOW HOW TO TWENTY FOUR HOUR CLOCK WHICH WE CAUSE WE HADN'T STARTED TO USE THEN AND THE BASICS REALLY BASIC AND I FOUND IT QUITE ENJOYABLE IT WAS JUST LIKE BEING AT SCHOOL REALLY AND WHAT ABOUT YOUR RELAY WERE WARIS YET THEM PRETTY SPARTAN WERE NOT TOO BAD IT WAS AN OLD NISSEN HUTS AND I THINK THEY'D BEEN USED BY HAND AND I THINK METHENY MENTIONS IN HER BOOK I THINK THEY'D BEEN USED BY THE POST OFFICE IT BUT ALL OLD NISSEN HUTS ON THIS BIG BIG SIT AT NEWTON FELL WERE JUST OUTSIDE WARRINGTON AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOW BEEN DEVELOPED INTO A BIG HOUSING IT SITE BUT IT WAS A VERY LARGE CAMP AND MOSTLY THE RENARY BUT THERE WERE ALSO THE MEN ON BOARD AS WELL THEY WERE LEARNING AND I THINK THEY WERE DOING W TEA BUT WE WERE OBVIOUSLY BEING TRAINED TO TAKE OVER SOME OF THE SIGNAL STATIONS FROM THE MEN TO RELEASE THEM AND WHICH WE WENT AFTERWARDS OBVIOUSLY SO I GOT MY DRAFT UP TO OPEN WHERE YOU GET A DRAUGHT AND YOU KNOW HOW IS YOUR COMMUNICATION YOUR PARENTS AND THIS DRAUGHT YOU SAY MA'AM UNAWARES THAT HOW DID YOU GET THERE WOULD YOU ACTING WELL A BIT STAGGERED IN MY MY MOTHER MY FATHER AS MY FATHER TOOK ME UP TO EUSTON STATION AND I GOT THIS DRAUGHT JUST A THING I REPORT TO THE AND I SUPPOSE IT WAS A SORT OF A PATROL POLICE UP IN USE THEN I WAS SENT ON TO A WHEN I GO FROM KINGS NOICENTIC WENT TO KING'S CROSS AND HAD TO GO TO EUSTON AND ON THIS MILITARY STUFF AND ALL IN SIEVES ONLY ALLOWED TO TAKE A SUITCASE OF CLOTHES ONE ONE OUTFIT OF SIVICLOTHES AND THEN KNOW THE USUAL PAJAMAS ALWAYS PAJAMAS AND SLIP HERE THE USUAL SORT OF THINGS YOU WERE GOING INTO HOSPITAL BUT ONLY ONE SET OF CIVIC AT CIVILIAN CLOTHES AND TO REPORT TO THIS PLACE IN ANY ONE OF THE STATIONS I THINK IT WAS KINGS CROSS AND THEY TOOK ME UNDER THEIR WING AND SORTED ME OUT AND GOT ME ON TO THE TRAIN MY FATHER SAW ME OFF AND THAT WAS REALLY ALL THAT HAPPENED I ENDED UP I THOUGHT WHEREVER AM I GOING YOU KNOW YOU GO MARSEUS CUT ALL THE ARE QUITE A FEW SAILORS ON GOING UP TO IF THEY COME BACK ON LEAVE AND THEY WERE ALL KIND TO ME THEY'LL REALIZE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THE TRAIN WAS CROWDED AND I CAN REMEMBER WE COULDN'T SIT DOWN ANYWHERE AND ONE OF THE SAILORS PUT ME UP ON TO THE TOP OF THE RACK AT THE TOP SO I COULD HAVE A SLEEP I CAN ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT AND WE GOT TO A CARLYLE THERE WAS AN AIR RAID WARNING AND WE HAD TO STAY IN CARLYLE DECIDING FOR ABOUT AN HOUR WHICH MEANT THAT I HAD MISSED MY TRAIN FROM CARLYLE TO A STERLING WHERE I HAD TO CHANGE AGAIN SO AND THAT WAS ANOTHER PROBLEM AND GOT GOT TO STIRLING AND COURSE THE TRAIN TO OBAN HAD GONE SO I WAS STRANDED AND THE W S PUT ME UP IN A HOTEL HOSTEL FOR THE NIGHT AND THEN I WENT ON TO OBAN REPORTED TO OBAN TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OPEN AND WAS TOLD I WAS GOING TO A PEER SIGNAL STATION IN THE MORNING I GOT GOING TO THE PIER SIGNAL STATION IN THE MEANTIME OF COURSE I'VE BEEN KITTED UP AND A CABIN WE WERE KITTED UP AND BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BELL BOTTOMS NOW THAT IS ESSENTIAL FOR A REVIS RAN BECAUSE IT'S SO COLD SO I WAS ISSUED WITH BELL BOTTOMS AND THE NEXT DAY WENT ON DUTY NOR HAD WE KNOWN AND I THOUGHT THIS IS CRAZY ALL THIS SORT OF BUSINESS AT A CABLE ALL THE STRICT DISCIPLINE NAVEL DISCIPLINE NOBODY SEEMED TO BE BOTHERED OR IT I DON'T THINK YOU THINK THAT THEY REALIZED THERE WAS A WAR ON EXCEPT FOR THE COURSE THE CONVOYS COMING IN AND I LIKED I LIKED IT I LIKE SCOTLAND STEPHANIE DIDN'T LIKE IT IF YOU'LL READ IN HER BOOK IF YOU EVER READ IT AND SHE JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO MIX HIM VERY WELL WITH SCOTTISH PEOPLE BUT I HAD GOT A SCOTTISH GRANDFATHER PERHAPS AS SO I DID SORT OF ACCEPT IT MORE AND I REALIZE THAT THEY ARE A BIT INSULAR AND THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO BE OFF PUTTING BUT THEY WERE IN CASE IT IS AN INSOLENT LAND UP IN THE HIGHLANDS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THE HIGHLANDS VERY WELL THERE ARE A THING AND TO THEMSELVES WELL SUGGEST ME EVER THEN JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ABOUT WHAT THE FACE WAS THAT WELL YOU SURROUND AS MY WAYS THAT IT IS THIS OPENNESS OPEN AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT THE WORK YES WELL I OPEN FIRST OF ALL AND OUR STATION YOU KNEW WHAT WAS CALLED THE STATION HOTEL AND THE SIGNAL STATION ON THE PIER WAS ONLY A SHORT WALK AWAY AND I MET UP WITH THE GIRL WHO WAS GOING TO WORK WITH ME SHE'D BEEN THERE ABOUT A WEEK WE HADN'T YET STARTED REALLY GETTING THE CONVOYS IN SO WE WERE TOLD WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THAT TO THE CONVOYS WOULD COME IN AND THEIR BEING A BAY AND WE'VE HAD TO MANLY MAN THE MAN ALL THE TIME AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO ON ANY BOATS AND THAT'S ANOTHER THE STORY AND WE HAD TO MOUNT MONITOR EVERYTHING COMING IN AND OUT WE ALSO HAD TO LOOK AFTER FUNNY ENOUGH HE ARE F HAD THE SUNDERLAND AND CATALINAS UP THERE AND THEY HAD A CALL SIGN WHICH CHANGED EVERY HOUR AND HALF OF THEM COULD NEVER EVER READ IT SO WE USED TO HAVE TO READ THEIR COAT SIGNAL FOR THEM TO SEND THEIR PATROL BELL TO HELP BUT THAT WAS BUT UNBEKNOWN TO A BASE WHO NEVER HAD A CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON IT WAS A CRAZY SET UP REALLY AND THE SUBMARINES ON PATROL DUTY USED TO COME IN ALONGSIDE THE PIER WE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THEM THEIR SIGNALS AND THEY WERE WENT OUT ON PATROL THAT WAS MOSTLY WHAT WE WERE DOING IN THE PEER SIGNAL STATION AND BUT THIS WASN'T ADEQUATE ENOUGH AND GANAVAN SIGNAL STATION WHICH WAS RIGHT ROUND THE CORNER FROM WHERE WE WERE WAS STILL MANNED BY THE MEN AND THEY ALSO HAD A NEW AZTEC CENTER OPENING UP JUST BELOW I WISH WE RADAR AN ASIC AND THEY LET WERE STILL DONE BY THE MEN AND THE MEN WERE GOING FROM GANOVAN AND THEY WERE GOING OVER TO DISMAL THE WRENS WENT ALOUD OUT THERE BECAUSE IT WAS NO IT WAS COMPLETELY ALONE AT THE NO IT WAS NO INHABITATION OF SAY A FEW FOR FEW SHEEP FARMERS SO WILLIAM WRENS WENT ALOUD OUT SMALL AND THAT'S WHERE THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN AND BE KNOWN TO ANYBODY AND SO THE GANAVAN SIGNAL STATION WAS GOING TO OPEN NOW AND WE WERE GOING TO GO THERE WHICH MADE VERY GREAT DIFFICULTY BECAUSE FROM THE STATION HOTEL TO GANABON IT WAS ABOUT COUPLE OF THREE MILES TWO OR THREE MILES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT'S NO OAK AND SO VENTUALLY I WAS THERE FOR ABOUT PEER SIGNAL STATION FOR ABOUT I WOULD SAY ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE GANABAN WAS OPEN GANABON SIGNAL STATION WAS THEN OPENED UP FOR THE WRENS AND WE TOOK OVER FROM THE MEN WE KNOW WE HAD AN INTACT THEN OF MORE VIERS FRIENDS SO NOW SIX OF US INSTEAD OF FOUR AND WE TOOK OVER GANOVAN FROM THE MEN VERY VERY SPARTAN WHEN WE WERE AT THE PEER SIGNAL STATION WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE MEALS WITH IN A MESS PROPER MEALS AND ONE NIGHT WATCH I WOULD DO US UP NICE SANDWICHES WHEN WE MOVED FROM PEER SIGNAL STATION TO THE GANOVAN SIGNAL STATION WE WERE STATIONED AT A PLACE CALLED RACE LODGE WHICH WAS VERY TOUGH GOING AND THEY DON'T LIKE WATCH KEEPERS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T HANDLE US THEY NEARLY ALL NEARLY WHOLE OF THE AND RENARY WAS WRITERS OR W T OPERATORS WHO WORKED PROPER WATCH OUT THEY WERE NINE TO FIVE NOT AS WE HAD YOU KNOW WE HAD TO DO A WATCH KEEPING HOURS THE SAME AS THE NAVY SO WE IF YOU WERE LUCKY YOU GET A HOT DINNER IF YOU DIDN'T YOU JUST HAD A SAD IN SANDWICH SO THE FOOD WAS PRETTY SPOT IF YOU READ IN THE BOOK PEOPLE MY FRIENDS WHO READ THE BOOK SAY WHY DID YOU STAND IT BUT I SAID BUT THAT THE WARREN WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY DIFFERENT WE HAD TO GO DO IT WITH OUR JOB THE MEN IT WAS IT WAS A VERY VERY SPAR SIGNAL STATION AND AND I SHALL WE WANT ME TO DESCRIBE IT TO IS THE SIGNAL STATION ITSELF WAS RIGHT ON THE TOP OF EGANAVAN ON JUST BY DONAL DENALI HOUSE WHICH IS THE HOUSE OF THE LORD LADY OF DOODLE I THINK THEY WERE CORD YES MY DO AND IT WAS ON THEIR LAND AND IT HAD BEEN BUILT AS A LOOK OUT POST I THINK ORIGINALLY FOR THE COAST GUARDS IT WAS A VERY SPARSE THERE WAS TO A TUTU PLACE YOU HAD TO REACH IT BUT TO GET TO IT IT WAS A CLIMB UP A CLIFF ALMOST A SHEER CLIFF THE ROAD WENT BELOW US AND THE SHEER CLIFF UP WHICH WE HAD TO CARRY THE OLDEST LAMP BATTERIES WHICH WAS VERY HEAVY AND THEN AND WE HAD TO HAVE A COAL FIRE A BECAUSE WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO BURN ANY CONFIDENTIAL BOOKS WHICH WE HAD IF ANYTHING IF WE HAD ANY KIND OF AN INVASION AND WE HAD TO PUT BOOKS AT GOODNESS KNOWS HOW BECAUSE THEY WERE LED IN THEY WERE SAFE BUT WE THAT WHILE WE HAD THE FAR AND WE HAD A BANK DOWN BELOW AND THE SIGNAL UP THE TOP AND IT WOULD BE BALCONY ALL ROUND WE HAD A BIG TEN INCH AS THREE OLDEST LAMPS AND AN ARTY ARTY SET AND I WAS REALLY JUST GO YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE IT WE JUST PUSHED INTO THE DEPEND AND HOW FAR COULD YOU SEE FROM THERE WHAT WAS YOUR ONE COULD SEE THAT LITERARY WHERE SHE GOT IT WE COULD SEE RIGHT WE COULD SEE MALL RIGHT THE WAY DOWN TO MULL OVER TO THE SMALL BUT WE HAD PERFECT VISION OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS COMING AND GOING WHY WAS THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT STRETCH A COASTLINE IN TENS OF THE CONVOY YOU BECAUSE AND IT WAS VERY SAFE AND THEY THOUGHT AND THEY COULD COME IN IT WAS IF YOU COULD HAVE A LOOK AT A MAP AND IS A COMPLETE BAY AND TOBE MARRY THE ESCORT SHIPS AMUR TO USUALLY PATSY DESTROYERS WOULD DROP THE CONVOY OFF AND GO UP TO TOBE MARRY AND THEY WOULD GO UP TO UP THE SOUND OF MULL AND IF YOU CAN VISUALIZE THAT COASTLINE MALL ALMOST PROTECTS THE BAY SO THERE ANY SHIPS PASSING HAVE TO GO ROUND BEHIND THE MALL THEY DON'T REALIZE YOU KNOW THERE IS COMING IN LESS NOW THE STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK AND I THINK IT WAS A VERY SAFE HAVEN AND THE THEY CAME IN AND THEY WERE ESCORTED OFF FROM US PROBABLY DOWN TO A GURU INTO THE CODE FOR A LOADING OR THEY WOULD MASH UP READY TO GO OUT WITH EITHER AN EXPECT AN EIGHT OF ARRIVAL OR AN EXPECTED TIME OF DISPATCH THEY WERE EITHER COMING OR GOING AND WAS THE MOST THING EVER SAW THEM I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE HARBOUR WOULD BE FULL I WOULD SAY THIRTY ALL THAT IS THIRTY MOST LIKELY AND OF COURSE YOU'D HAD HAVE A LIST AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW YOU THINK OR THEY MIGHT BE A STRAGGLER BUT THEY WEREN'T NEVER CAME MERIDA THAT WAS THE TERRIBLE THING YOU THINK WHEN ONE HAPPENED TO THAT ONE AND WE HAD QUITE A LOT OF LOSSES UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN NOT IN THE BAY BUT YOU KNOW COMING AND GOING YOU EXPECT TO SEE IS CAUSE WE HAVE IT WE'D HAVE A LIST SENT TO US WHICH WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL LIST AN EXPECTED TIME OF ARRIVAL AND YOU'D GIVE THEM ABOUT TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT I NEVER CAME YOU KNOW YOU JUST WONDER WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WERE ALL MANNED BY A MOSTLY MERCHANT MERCHANT MEN SO THEIR MORSEL WASN'T VERY GOOD BUT NOW AND AGAIN YOU'D GET A SHIP WHICH HAD A FEW NEXT UNITED STATES WHEN WHEN AMERICA CAME IN IT WAS BETTER PLANNED YOU KNOW THE LIBERTY SHIPS CAME THEN AND THEY THEY WERE BETTER BETTER BETTER MANNED THEY WERE A LITTLE BE OVERPOWERING MERELY BECAUSE IT WAS SO SHALL I SAY THIS OVER CLEVER THEY USED TO SEND MORE AT THE RATE OF NOT THINKING THAT WE COULDN'T ANSWER IT WE WOULD SEND BACK AT THE SAME RATE AND MISSUS RABBIT DIDN'T LIKE THE AMERICANS VERY MUCH I'M AFRAID AND THEY TRIED ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY TRIED TO COME UP UP UP TO OUR SIGNAL STATION WE COULDN'T HAVE THEM IN WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM IN WE HAD ONE OR TWO PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE COMING UP AND ONE SHALL I GO ON ONE NIGHT AND I COULD HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING OUT THE THING IN A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND I THOUGHT IN THIS VOICE I DIDN'T UNDER WHO IT WAS OF A MAN'S VOICE WE ALREADY HAD MET A WREN MURDERED AT INVERARIA VS REN MURDERED AT INVERARI ON NIGHT WATCH SO WE WERE ALL VERY WELL BY WHICH IN OUR INTERSECT WE ALL WERE TAUGHT HOW TO HANDLE A PISTOL WE HAD TO GO ON THE RANGE WHICH WAS A THE R F HAD A RANGE AND WE WERE TAKEN ON TO THE RANGE BY INSTRUCTOR AND TAUGHT TO FIRE A PISTOL AND I HAD VERY SMALL WRISTS AND I WAS TORCH OF FIRE HOLDING MY WRIST SO I COULD FIRE WITH MY WRIST WE ALSO HAD A RIFLE OF UP ANY SIGNAL STATION IT WASN'T LOADED NO AMMUNITION IN IT BUT THE PISTOLS WERE BUT THIS RIFLE WASN'T LOADED IT WAS JUST THERE AS AS A WARNING I HEARD HIS FOOT AND THIS IS PERFECTLY TRUE WE HEARD HIS FOOTSTEPS COMING UP AND I SAID TO MY OPPO I DON'T LIKE THIS VERY MUCH SO THIS BOY KEPT KNACKING ON THE DOOR IN THE END I CUT THIS RIFLE I THOUGHT MY COUNT I KNEW WAS UNLOADED AND I THOUGHT NO ONE GOING TO DO SO POUNDED OUT THE OTHER WAY AND AS HIS VOICE CAME THROUGH THE THING AND LIFTED UP AND SPOT A CLOCK HIM ON THE HEAD WITH IT HE SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT SON IT'S ONLY ME AND IT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNAL MEN FROM DOWN BELOW STUPID WHO'D GOT A DATE I HAD CHANGED WATCHES WITH THE GIRL I SHOULDN'T TELL TELL OF THIS REALLY HE WAS USED TO COME UP FOR A CUP OF TEA AT THIS TIME AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH HER HE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON WATCH AND HE NEARLY GOT HIMSELF KILLED AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE IN MY RIGHTS BECAUSE WHEN NOBODY GOT A GREAT BIG PROHIBITED NOTIONS OUT OF THE MADERA I KNOW NEVER EVER CAME TO ANYTHING AND I NEVER EVER REPORTED IT BECAUSE WHEN I GOT HIM INTO TERRIBLE TROUBLE BUT WE WERE ARMED BUT ONLY WITH A PISTOL AND AT A RIFLE WITH NO AMMUNITION BECAUSE WE HAD A AREN INVERARI WAS A CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T KNOW I'M AFRAID ALL THAT IS A NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WE WERE JUST TOLD TO BE VERY AWARE AND I'LL TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS AND I THINK MEN STEPHANIE MENTIONS THIS IN OUR BOOK AS WELL WE NEVER EVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED AND WHEN WE HAD WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A SPY OR A MAN USED TO COME DOWN IT WAS ALL PROHIBITED LAND FOR CIVILIANS BUT THIS MAN USED TO COME DOWN SIT ON THE ROCKS AND WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS AND HE HAD NO CASINO CAMERA WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CONVOYS WE COULD TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AROUND THE OUR CABIN AROUND THE THING BUT NOT THE CONVOY NOT ALLOWED TO AND SO WE REPORTED THIS MAN TO OUR HEADQUARTERS BACK IN THE SIGNAL BACK IN THE STATION HOTEL NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ABOUT IT SO HE JUST DISAPPEARED NOW WE NEVER EVER HEARD WHETHER HE WAS JUST A LOCAL NEWSPAPER MAN OR WHETHER HE WAS A CON KIND OF A SPY OR WHETHER HE WAS JUST INTERESTED IN SHIP WE NEVER HEARD SEE I'M AFRAID IN THOSE DAYS HE WAS ALL NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD AND JUST TO LAY JUST TAKING UP ON THE AMERICANS WHAT YOU USE TO AS GREAT AS THE AMERICANS GET IS AS AND YES WHERE THEY WOULD TRY TO BRIBE US THEY WANTED TO COME UP THE SIGNAL STATION AND LOOK OUT LOOK HONEY WE'VE GOT SOME NYLONS OR HONEY WE'VE GOT THE NUNS ON BOARD YOU KNOW THIS AND SO STUPID AND SO CHILDISH WE TOOK A DISLIKE TO WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE WAS THE WAY THEY USED TO TREAT THEIR OFFICERS COMPLETE DISRESPECT THEY WOULD CALL THEM BY THEIR FIRST NAMES WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS TERRIBLE AND THE CAPTAINS ALL THE NEW OFFICERS NEVER SEEMED TO TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THEM WE WERE IN OBAN ONE DAY SHOPPING AND THE AMERICANS WERE CAME CAME ON BOARD CAME ON PRIVACY SHOPPING AS WELL AND WE LIKE TO TAKE US FOR A CUP OF COFFEE A FINE WHICH THEY DID WE TOOK THEM TO I M S HAD A CUP OF COFFEE GOING BACK SOME OF THEIR OFFICES WERE COMING THE OTHER WAY WHEN WE WERE APPALLED THE WAY THEY SPOKE NO SALUTING HI HI CAP I THOUGHT THIS IS TERRIBLE AT ME I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT THEY WERE JUST ANOTHER WORLD AWAY AND THEY WERE TRYING TO BRIBE US WITH BANANAS AND NYLONS AND WITCHES IN MONOTONE PLANT RENEAU WE THOUGHT THERE WAS SO CHILDISH BUT ALL THIS VERY FAST FLASHING MORSE YOU TOUCHED ON THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF IN A COMMUNICATION YOU HAD THE SAME FOR YOU YOU TALK ABOUT THE LAMPS THERE HE WILL ALONE SO JUST WHAT WHEN DID YOU USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNICATION NOW IS AT ONE SPECIFIC TYPE IN A BAR IN THE STATION YOU ALWAYS BY MORSE BY LIGHT OR SOME TIME BY OUR TEA AND NEARLY ALWAYS WITH THE ARTY WE RE REALLY ONLY USED FOR THE ASIC STATION AND LAMP MOSTLY THE OLDEST AND ALL THE BIG TEN INCH WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT OF COURSE TO HANDLE YOU HAD TO GO OUT ON THE BALL AND OF COURSE UP THERE THE WINDS WERE ALWAYS AT GALE FORCE AND WE ALWAYS HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOR THE WET FOR THE WEATHER EVERY DAY WE HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOR THE CONVOYS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER WAS WITH THE CONES THE CONES WERE YOU COME WITH A SHAPE LIKE THAT AND YOU HOISTED IT NOW ON WHICH WAY NOW UPWARDS FOR UPWARDS FOR THE NORTH WIND AND DOWN FOR FOR SOUTH IN VERY PRIMITIVE BUT IT GAVE THEM SOME IDEA OF THE WAY THE WIND I MEAN NOT ANOTHER THING YOU MEAN YOU COULD TELL THE WAY WITH WIND WAS BLAME JUST LOOK AT THE ENDS FROM WHICH WE ALWAYS HAD TO FLY THE WHITE ENRON AND WE HAD TO BUY BY THE COLORS OF THE WHITE ENSIGN PUT IT UP AT A SUNRISE AND DOWN AT SUNSET SO THE ENSIGN WAS ALWAYS FLYING SO YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHICH WAY THE WIND WAS GO BLOWING WITHOUT THE CONE BUT IT WAS A GALE FORCE WIND WE WISHED TO PUT THE COIN UP WHICH SOMETIMES MEANT THE COMBS UP FOR DAYS BECAUSE THE GALES WOULD BLOW UP THERE VERY VERY VERY WINDY AND SOMETIMES WE WOULD HAVE TO BE LASHED ON TO THE TEN INCH I BUY OUR UPPER BECAUSE IT WAS SO WINDY YOU KEPT BEING BLOWN AWAY IT WAS IT WAS VERY VERY COLD AND WENT VERY VERY WE WERE ALWAYS WET BUT WE DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER WE DO HAVE THE ONE BATHROOM WHEN WE WENT BACK TO THE GATE AND HOW OLD YOU SET SITUATED OTHER WELL THE NIGHT WATCH WAS A LONG ONE WE'D GO ON SOMETHING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AND COME OFF AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING THAT WAS A VERY LONG ONE AND THE OTHER WATCHES WERE PRETTY WELL AND FOUR HOURS ON OR FOUR HOURS OFF BUT IN THE NIGHT WATCH WAS WITH A TOUGH ONE THAT YOU HAD TO WALK THERE FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO WALK WE COULDN'T BE OBJECTED BECAUSE THE MAN IN MEN IN THE ESTA STATION DOWN BELOW US GOT TRANSPORT THEY WERE WORKING THE SAME WATCHES OH WELL YES OK THEN THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD ISSUE US WITH BICYCLES WHICH THEY DID AND WE HAD A RUN OFFICER CAME UP TO SEE US AND HE SAID THIS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND THEN THEY SUPPLIED TRANSPORT FOR US SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK THE NIGHT WATCH BACK AND FOR THREE OR FOUR MILES IN THE PITCH DARK ALONG ALL THE COAST ROAD BUT FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO BEFORE THEY REALIZED THAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE'S A STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YOUR LET THE DUKE OF WILL BE WE NEVER HAD THE VERY BIG SHIPS THE BIGGEST SHIP THOUGH ESCORT SHIP EVER REALLY CAME IN TO US WHERE WE ARE DESTROYERS OR OR COVER COVETS AND BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS USED TO GO INTO MALE TO WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS TO GO BACK OUT SO WE NEVER REALLY HAD ANYTHING WHAT I WOULD CALL VERY LARGE I WAS ON WATCH WITH STEPHANIE AND ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION AND NOW IF YOU CAN PICTURE KNOW THE ISLANDS AND THE SEA AND SUDDENLY YOU SEE A GREAT BIG CROSS ANCHOR ACROSS MOUSE COMING ACTUALLY WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE AND WE HAD NO EASY FOR ANYTHING WE HAD NOTHING WHAT EVERYTHING WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT OF COURSE WE CALLED IT UP NO REPLY OF COURSE THAT WAS WORRYING NO REPLY BECAUSE IT'S A SPECIAL EVERY EVERY HOUR IT CHANGED THE CALL UP SINK CHANGED AND THE CODE BOOK SO YOU WOULD CALL THEM UP BY THE CODE WHICH IT WAS THE DAY NO REPLY SO WE HAD A LITTLE SHIP WE HAD TWO SHIPS ACTUALLY ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN STAR ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN WAVE THEY WERE PATROL SHIPS WHICH USED TO PATROL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AMONG THE CONVOYS ALL THE TIME THEY WERE OLD WHAT I WOULD CALL SOMETHING LIKE A CORVETTE I THINK THEY WERE OLD TRAILERS THEY WERE MANNED BY A NAVY AND THEY WERE IF ANY TROUBLE WE CALLED THEM UP IMMEDIATELY AND WHEN WE CALLED UP THE SOUTHERN STAR SHE WAS A RIGHT WAY WAY OUT OVER MALE AND ASKED HER WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT ME SHE SAID I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING FROM HERE BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE IN A WAY WAY WHICH ARE GOING INVESTIGATE SHE IF IT'S ENDING TROUBLE I'LL PUT A SHOT ACROSS ITS BOWS AT THAT ANYWAY THIS THING GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER EVENTUALLY I MANAGED TO CALL UP I OVERSEE THE THE BUNTING TOSSER THAT'S WHAT VISUAL SIGNALS ARE CALLED BUNTING TOSSES WAS ASLEEP I SHOULD THINK HE THOUGHT OF WERE ONLY CROSSING ROUND THESE ISLANDS AND HE CAME BACK QUICKLY WITH D OF WHY INSTEAD OF A PENNANT NUMBERS CUT ALL SHIPS HAVE PANIC NUMBERS EITHER THE PENNANT NUMBER OF THE SHIP OR THE COLD WHICH CAME BUT WITH NOTHING QUICKLY DE OF WAR AND I SAID TO STEP AND OF A DUKE OF YORK COSTAS A BATTLESHIP I SAID BAS DON'T KNOW SO WE QUICKLY FORMED OUR BASE THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE US BECAUSE NOBODY HAD GOT ONESIE ANYWAY THE CAPTAIN OF THE OUR CAPTAIN BASE CAME RUSHING DOWN TOOK HIM ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO GET TO US BY WHICH TIME SHE WAS IN FULL VIEW MASSY IT JUST FILLED UP THE WHOLE OF THE BAY I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT AND COURSE IT WAS A GREAT BIG HEAR ABOUT THIS WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW BUT OF COURSE SHE WAS ON SHE WAS ON PILGRIMAGE UP TO NORWAY AFTER THE EMISCHANHORS AND SHE WAS DOING THIS TO THEM I SUPPOSE SHE THOUGHT WE GOT TIME TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DID IT THE OLD WAY OF COURSE I MEAN ME NOTHING WOULD EVER SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN THE WAY VERY WELL IT'S VERY DANGEROUS OUT THERE BUT SHE DID SHE CAME RIGHT PAST US STAYING JUST OFF MULL I MEAN I COULD SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE SHE WAS IT WAS THE MAP AND SHE JUST APPEARED BEHIND THE ISLAND AS IF HE WAS ON SOME KIND OF A FILM IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND IT'S SORT OF THINKING YOU BE TO DREAM ABOUT THAT IS DOING THAT IS DOING WHEN NOBODY EVER REALLY AGAIN I NEED TO KNOW WE NEVER HAVE REALLY FOUND OUT WHEN WE REALIZED AFTER WAS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHE WERE ON OUR WAY UP TO THE BATTLE IN YOUR WAY DRINK OF TEA WAS THE INDEED THEY CAME WE HAD ALL THE SHIPS WE HAD WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT WHY THEY LOOKED SO DREADFUL THEY WERE ALL SORT OF BATTERED SHIPS WE THOUGHT WE HAD SEEN SOME AWFUL SIGHTS BUT THEY WERE THE ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY OF THEM I SHOULD THINK WITH WITH TWO DESTROYERS DURBAN AND SOMETHING ELSE ON ONE WAS THE DURBAN ONE WITH MAYBE I'VE WRITTEN IT MAYBE SHE'S MENTIONED IN THE BOOK ANYWAY AND WE THOUGHT GOD I DESTROY AS A TERRIBLE STATE SURELY A NAVY KNOW THEY WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE THEY CAME IN I SUPPOSE THEY WERE IN ABOUT A WEEK MORE THAN THAT TEN DAYS ENOUGH TIME FOR STEPHANIE TO GET TO KNOW THE SIGNAL MAN AND SO MUST BE TEN DAYS AND WE STILL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WHY THEY WEREN'T SUCH OPEN WHY THEY DIDN'T CAUSE THEY ONLY EVER STAYED FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS BUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A LONG TIME AND WE THOUGHT A LOW SOMETHINGS SOMETHING'S GOING ON THEN ALL OR WE WERE TOLD WOMEN WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO POST ANY MORE LETTERS ALL OUR LETTERS WERE TO BE COUNTED ALL THEIR POSTAGE OUT WAS TO BE COUNSELLED EVERYTHING GOING OUT FROM THE BASE WAS TO BE STOPPED AND WE ALL LEAVE A STOPPING WITH SOMETHING'S IN THE AIR NOW YOU GET THAT AND WE THOUGHT WHERE ARE THEY GOING WHAT THEY GOING TO DO OF COURSE THEY WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS A NIGHT BEFORE D DAY THEY SAY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT OR SO THEY SAID IN THE NIGHT BEFORE THEY ALL SEEMED TO BE GETTING READY THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG SHIP CAME ALONGSIDE SOME OF THEM AND TOOK OFF A LOT OF STUFF WE THOUGHT THEY DON'T USUALLY UNLOAD HERE IT GOES TO GOUROCK AND GRANIC BUT THEY WERE UNLOADING ALL SORTS OF STUFF WE WATCHED THEM THROUGH THE TELESCOPE NO CHAIRS AND TABLES AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS WERE COMING OUT WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS NO NO NEXT DAY WE WHEN WHEN WE CAME UP ON WATCH THEY WERE ALL BUSY GETTING READY TO GO OUT AND WE HAD NO EXPECTED TIME OF DEPARTURE AT ALL THEY ALL JUST SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR AND OUR TWO PATROL SHIPS HAD NO IDEA THEY SAID WHAT DO WE DO WHERE THEY'RE GOING WHERE WERE WE HADN'T WE COULDN'T TELL THEM BECAUSE IT WAS SO SECRET AND THAT'S THE END OF THE DE DAY THAT WAS ALL THE BLOCK SHIPS GOING DOWN THEY ALL THE ROTTEN OLD SHIPS THAT NOBODY WANTED THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD BEEN SO BATTLE SCARRED THAT THEY WERE ALMOST UNTHINKABLE THINKABLE SO THEY WERE THE TWO BIG BLOCK SHIPS AND THESE WERE SENT DOWN TO HELP OUT AND WE NEVER EVER HEARD UNTIL THE END OF THE WAR WERE IT WAS ALL ABOUT AND THESE ARE THE POVERTY THEN WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS THING THAT YOU TOUCHED ON EARLIER BUT I LIKE MORE CLARIFICATION ON IT IS IS THAT THAT THE CONVOYS SENSE YOU DID TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTATION CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN AGAIN FOR ME YOU KNOW HOW THE ROSES A DISPATCH RIDER WOULD ARRIVE FROM BASE IF THE STATION HOTEL WHICH IS THEIR BASE SUCH PRIDE WOULD ARRIVE WITH A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH WOULD CONTAIN EIGHT OF THE NEXT CONVOY COMING IN AND RIGHT SO YOU THEN GET IT OUT PUT IN FRONT OF YOU PUT IT UP AND WAIT FOR THE FIRST ONE LITERARY TO COME IN WE EIGHTY NINE HUNDRED YOU MAY PERHAPS IT WOULDN'T START TO COME INTO NINE THREE HUNDRED THEY'D ALWAYS BEEN MARKED I SUPPOSE I THINK FROM IRELAND THEY WERE THEN SORT OF MARKED ACROSS WHO WOULD GET THE EATER OF THEM COMING ACROSS AND THAT WAS LITERY HOW WE GOT THE EIGHTY AS FROM A DISPATCH RIDER CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WOULD COME AND I SUPPOSE THEY BET EVERY THE CONVOYS WERE COMING IN QUITE REGULARLY AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH COMING IN AT THE TIME THEY'D GONE OUT AGAIN THE BAY WAS ALWAYS REALLY NEW ALWAYS CHOCKABLOCK AND OF COURSE YOU GOT THAT ALSO GOT THE RAF BOATS GOING BACK WITH SOME FORWARDS WITH THE SUNDERLAND AND THE I'M CATALINA SO IT WAS QUITE A BUSY LITTLE HARBOUR AND EVERY SINGLE THING HAD TO BE LOGGED AND LOGGED OUT IDENTIFIED AND PUT DOWN HE KNOWS SO YOU HAD TO BE ON WATCH PRETTY WELL AWARE WHAT WAS GOING ON ALL AROUND YOU LITERARY IN THE AIR WITH THE CATALINAS THIS IS WHY WE HAD TO HAVE SOUTHERN WAVE AND SOUTHERN STAR WHO USED TO BE OUT THEY WERE ALSO SIGNALING AND TRYING TO GET THEM IT WAS REALLY LIKE A GREAT BIG HERD OF SHEEP AND TWO SHEPHERDS TRYING TO GET THEM IN IT WAS IT COULD HAVE BEEN ORGANIZED CHAOS BUT IT WASN'T IT WAS VERY VERY GOOD ALWAYS WORKED IT JUST REALLY SHEPHERDING THESE SHIPS WE KNOW AND MISS BIG LIBERTY SHIP THEY WERE QUITE BIG THAT THESE LIBERTIES SHOULD HAVE IS SO SO COOL IN THAT YOU WAS YES EACH WE WE KNEW THAT WE HAD WE KNEW EACH AT ONE WAS THAT WE HAD AN IDENTIFICATION FOR EACH ONE SO WE COULD MARK THEM OFF IF NOT WE GOT THERE EVERYONE'S NAME WE KNOW IF SOMEONE WERE VERY LONG BUT YES WE HAD IDENTIFICATION FOR ALL OF THEM AND YOU HAD TO CONCENTRATE QUITE HARD WHEN THEY WERE COMING IN YOU COULDN'T THE EXTENSION WONDER BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO BE SO QUICK AND YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF THEM NOT COMING IN AND YOU WHAT HOW DO YOU FEEL IT YOU KNOW YOU'VE DONE FINE CONVOYS AND YOU'VE MISSING TWENTY BOATS WELL WHAT WAS THE FEELING WELL YOU FIRST OF ALL WELL IT FIRST HAPPENED YOU IF AT ALL AND NO WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE WHOM I HOPE THEY'RE ALL RIGHT KNOWING IT BUT IS TIME YOU'VE DONE IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR OR SO YOU YOU'VE JUST ACCEPTED WHAT DO WHAT DO YOU DO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED AGAIN YOU GOT THIS NEED TO KNOW WE USE TO TRY AND FIND OUT WE NEVER EVER TOLD THE THREE OF THE THREE OF THEM BOBBY BEEN SUNK OFF SOMEWHERE AND YOU SEE I WONDER HOW FAR THEY GOT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MEN AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THAT LOVELY STUFF THAT WAS COMING IN OR
