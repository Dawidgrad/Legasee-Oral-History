WAS COLOURBLIND SO I WAS AUTOMATICALLY TRANSFERRED TO THE STEWARDING BRANCH WHICH I DIDN'T WANT BUT YOU HAD NO CHOICE YOU DID WHAT YOU WERE TOLD AND I GOT TRANSFERRED TO MINE SWEEPERS AND ER I WAS BASED THE ISE OF E SHIP HERE AT QUEENSBOROUGH QUEENSLAND QUEENBOROUGH PEER AND WE HAD ABOUT ERTEN MINUS WE WAS THERE A WE WENT OUT EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS TO SWEEP ANY MINES THAT HAD BEEN DROPPED BY THE BOATS IN THE HOPE OF SINKING OUR SUPPLY SHIPS CAN I WHY DID YOU JOIN THE NAVY BECAUSE I WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE FIGHT I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LEFT BEHIND AT THE TIME I WAS EWHAT ARE THEY CALLIN A RESERVED OCCUPATION I WAS AN APPRENTICE AS AN ELECTRICAL ENGINEER AND MY DAD DIDN'T WANT ME TO ERM TO JOIN UP E WAS IN THE LAST WAR AND HE WOULD AVE PREFERRED ME TO LEARN A GOOD STEADY TRADE BUT I WANTED TO GO SO AS SOON AS I WAS EIGHTEEN I WENT OVER FROM EMAJORSTONE WHERE OUR HOME WAS I CAME OVER TO CHATHAM TO PEMBROKE BARRACKS AND ERM SIGNED UP I SAID I WAS NINETEEN BUT ERIT DIDN'T MATTER BECAUSE THEY JUST ACCEPTED YOU IF YOU COULD EBREATHE IN OUT AND MOVE YOUR ARMS YOU WERE PHYSICALLY FIT I WAS TOLD TO GO HOME AND WAIT AND I'D BE CONTACTED ABOUT A WEEK LATER THE ONVELOPE CAME REPORTS OT CHATHAM BARRACKS ON SUCH AND SUCH A DAY WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE WAR WITHOUT ACTUALLY SEEING A GERMAN WE HAD E LONG RAGE FIGHTS WITH THEM BUT I NEVER ACTUALLY SAW A GERMAN BUT JOHN WH WHY DIDN'T YOU KNOW YOU WANTED TO DO YOUR BIT BUT WHY DIDN YOU NOT JOIN THE ARMY OR THE RAF IWAM NOT INTERESTED IN EITHER ITS A TRADITIONAL FAMILY MY FATHER WAS IN THE NAVY SO WAS MY GRANDFATHER AND AN UNCLE MY GRANDFATHER WAS ON BT HIS FLAGSHIP THE LION AT THE BATTLE OF JATLAND AND HE DIDN'T COME ON DECK FOR THREE DAYS HE WAS IN THE ENGINEERING BRANCH BUT EM THAT'S THE SERVICE I WANTED TO JOIN SO I DID AND WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF YOUR TRAINING ER IT'S RATHER CONFUSED WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND YOU DON'T ERM TAKE THINGS IN SO EASILY BUT FROM PEMBROKE HOUSE PEMBROKE BARRACKS WE WERE ALL MARCHED DOWN TO THE E FURTHER DOWN THE YARD WHERE WE GOT FITTED OUT AND AT THAT TIME E EVERYONE A LESSOF AN OFFICER WARE THE SAME FOUR AND HALF RIG WITH BELL BOTTOMS THE SCARP AND THE THE HAT SENT UP TO SKAG MESS WITH ANOTHER BUNCH TO BUTLINS HOLIDY CAMP AND THAT BECAME HMS ROYAL ARTHUR AND I WAS TO START UM TRAINING AS A TELEGRAPHIST SIGNALLER AND I'VE BEEN DOING MORSE CODE YOU STARTED ON THE MORSE CODE FOR ABOUT A FORTNIGHT THEN SOMEBODY SAID OH THIS LOT HAVEN'T HAD A COLOTIST THEY'D BETTER HAVE IT MOST OF THEM PASSD BUT TWO OTHERS AND ME WERE ALL STRONGLY COLOURE BLIND SO YOU'RE OUT IF YOU SEND THE WRONG COLOURS WHEN YOU'RE SIGNALLING IT COULD BE A DISASTER SO THAT'S WHEN I WAS TRANSFERRED ONTO MINE SWEEPERS ON THE STEWARDING BRANCH WERE YOU DISAPPOINTED YES NOBODY LIKED BEING ON MINES WEEPERS WE ALL KEPT PUTTING IIN FOR TRANSFER TO SOMETHING MORE GLAMOUROUS DESTROYERS SUBMARINES MT BS M G BS BUT ALWAYS GOT TURNED DOWN YOU'RE DOING AN IMPORTANT JOB YOU WILL STAY PUT AND THAT WAS IT HOW MANY PEOPLE ON ONE OF THESE MINE SWEEPERS HOWWHAT WAS THE THE BOAT LIKE ER FIVE OFFICERS AND ERM ABOUT ER TWELVE FIFTEEN CREW THAT INCLUDES THETHE ENGINEERS OR THE STOKERS BRANCH S HEY CALLED IT SIGNELLING AND ER AND THOSE DOING THE ACTUAL MINE DETECTING WHEN WE FIRST STARTED WENT OUT MINE SWEEPING IT WAS R THREE DAYS ON ONE DAY OFF AND WE HAD TWO SEAMEN STANDING IN THE BOWS WITH RIFLES WHEN THEY SAW A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING BY THEY'D SHOOT AT IT HIT THE HORNS AND BLOW IT UP BUT THAT WAS WHEN THEY ERM STARTED THE MINES SWEEPING CAMPAIGN AND THEY GERMANS WHEN THEY DROPPED THEM HAD LONG WEIGHTS ON WIRES SO THEY JUST FLOATED BELOW THE SURFACE TO HIT THE SHIP IF ONE OF THOSE WIRES CAME LOOSE THE MINE WOULD BOB ON THE SURFACE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE LOOKED FOR EACH TIME WE WENT OUT WHEN THE GERMANS OCCUPIED FRANCE THEI COURSE GOT RIGHT ON THE COAST LINE AND THEY HAD BIG GUNS A CAPTAIN GRENAIR AND HE USED TO POP AWAY AT US EVERY TIME WE CAME OUT BUTFORTUNATELY WE NEVER GOT HIT THERE WAS ONE EM AMUSING ANECDOTE OUR COMMODORE HAD BEEN ERM A SENIOR CAPTAIN BEFORE THE WAR AND HE RETIRED OF COURSE HE WAS BROUGHT BACK IN AND MADE COMMODORE OF THE MINE SWEEPING FLEET HE HAD HIS TWELVE MINE SWEEPERS AND WE USED TO GOHO AND DO THE SAME THING EVERY DAY A GERMANS BEING VERY MARTICULOUS WOULD COME OUT WELL SAY FRIDAYS AND TUESDAYS NOT ONLY THE SAME DAY BUT AT THE SAME TIME TO LAY THEIR MINDS AND THEN DASH BACK IN WE WENT OUT THE FOLLOWING MORNING EACH TIME TO PICK HEM UP AND THE SKIPPER GOT A BIT FED UP WITH THIS AND ERM E TOLD THE CONFERENCE OF HIS CAPTAINSONE DAY IS THE NEXT TIME WE GO SWEEPING RUN YOUR TRAWLS OUT BUT DON'T DROP YOUR WIRES WHICH IS OF COURSE CONTRARY TO ALL NAVAL INSTRUCTIONS HE COULD HAV GOT COUGHT MARSHAL IF ANYTHINTHING HAPPENED BUT WE WENT THROUGH THE GERMAN MINEFIELD AS THEYAD LAID IT AND WE GOT AWAY WITH IT SO THE GERMANS CAME OUT AGAIN TO REPLACE THE MINES THEY THOUGHT WE'D PICKED UP AND THEY LOST FOUR OFTHEIR OWN BOATS ON THEIR OWN MINES AND I DON'T THINK THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS VERY SPORTING WIS THAT DOCUMENTED COMENTED SOMEWHERE IN THE ADMIRALTY ARCHIVES YEAH MAZING A GOOD IDEA HE COULD HAVE GOT INTO A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE FOR THAT WHAT WAS YOUR ROLE WHAT WERE YOU DOING WHEN WE WENT OUT I WAS ER DUE THO REPORT WITH SIX OTHER STEWARDS WE REPORTED TO THE FIRST LIETENANT WERE DAMAGED CONTROL PARTY IF THE SHIP GOT HIT WE HAD TO CLEAR THE DAMAGE WAY PUT OUT ANY FIRES AND PUL THE WOUNDED INTO THE WAR ROOM WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS WAITING TO DO WHAT HE COULD BUT FORTUNATELY IT NEVER HAPPENED BUT THAT WAS MY OFFICIAL STATION AND WHAT ABOUT BAD WEATHER AND ER STORMS AND STUFF DI YOU EVER ENCOUNTER ANY DANGERS WHEN YOU HAD WHAT ANY STORMS BAD WEATHER BIG SEAS WELL WE HAD SOME YES BUT ER WE STILL WENT OUT JU PUT ON YOUR SAIL WESTE AND ERM THAT WAS IT YOU HAD SAFETY LINES RIGGD FORE AND HALF SO YOU YOU HOLD ONTO THOSE YOU WOULDN'T GET WASHED OVERBOARD WHAT ABOUT DID YOU WAS I WS IT WHAT WAS IT LIKE WATCHING THE PLANES TAKING GOING OVER YOU AND STUFF DID YOU SEE MUCH ACTIVITY IN THE AIR WE WERE FORTUNATELY WEE NEVER GOT ATTACK FROM THE AIR I DON'T THINK THEY THE GERMANS THOUGHT OUR LITTLE BOATS WERE WORTH WASTING A BOMB ON THEY WANTED HIM FOR THE CAPITAL CITIES OR THE AIR FIELDS WERE YOU INVOLVED IN D DAY AT ALL YES NOW A WEEK BEFORE D DAY THE BASE WAS SHUT DOWN LIKE AN OYSTER NOBODY COULD GO OFF NO ON WAS ALLOWED IN FOR SECURITY REASONS OBVIOUSLY YOU COULDN'T GET ANY POST YOU COULDN'T MAKE ANY PHONE CALLS BECAUSE IT WAS COMING UP ALTHOUGH OFFICIALLY WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT AND FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS BEFORE D DAY ON ADMIRALTY INSTRUCTIONS WE STARTED NIGHT SWEEPING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE DAY SHIFT SO THE GERMANS WERE GETTNG USED TO THE IDEA OF US POPPING ALONG THE COAST DURING THE HOURS OF DARKNESS THEY WOULDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT SO THE EARLY MORNING OF D DAY WE WENT OUT AT MIDNIGHT AND WE WERE SWEEPING RIGHT UP TO THE LINE WHERE THE BATTLESHIPS WERE WAITING TO BOMBARD THE COAST WE KNEW EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO BE STATIONED AND WE SWEPT THAT MOST CAREFULLY AND THEN WE AS THEY STARTED COMING UP OUT OF THE DARKNESS FROM TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND WAITING AND WE WERE TIRED BEHIND THEM THERE WASN'T ANYTHING ELSE FOR US TO DO WE GOT SENT BACK HERE TO THE ISL OF SHEVI WHEN THE TROOPS WENT ASHORE WE WERE A BIT ANNOYED BECAUSE WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING AND THEN ERM ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE DAYS LATER A SKIPPER GOT THE ORDERS TO PATROL THE DUTCH COAST ON THE SHELTZ AND PICK UP ALL THE MINES WHICH THE GERMANS HAD SOWN LIBERALLY ROUND ALL THE THE COAST THERE SO THAT KEPT US BUSY FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS AND ER WE WERE STATIONED AT A LITTLE TOWN CALLED TERENUZAN A VERY SMALL PORT BUT THERE WAS ERM A LONG JETTY SO WE COULD MORE ALONGSIDE THERE AND ER INTHE EVENINGS LATE AFTERNOON YOU GOT SHORE LEAVE UNTIL YOU WERE GOING OFF AGAIN NEXT MORNING AND I NEVER FORGOTTEN THE THINGS WE SAW WHEN WE WRENT ASHORE THE GERMANS HAD GOT OUT IN A HURRY AND THEIR SIGNS WERE EVERYWHERE ON A HOTEL LOUNGE TATBU BEING IN AN OFFICERS MESS AND THE SIGNS WERE STILL UP AND THEY BLEW SOME OF THE BRIDGES OVER THE CANALS AS THEY LEFT AND THE DUTCH FLOODED SOME OF THE DIKES TO STOP THEIR HEAVY TRAFFIC GETTING AWAY AND I REMEMBER ONCE WE WENT ASHORE WE ALL CARRIED THE NAVY RAINCOAT DRAPED OVER YOUR ARM FOLDED IN A CERTAIN WAY AND THE OFFICER WATCH KNEW VERY WELL WE HAD THINGS IN THEIR POCKETS CIGARETTES PACKEGE OF BISCUITS A TINNER JAM OR WHATEVER WHICH WERES NOT SUPPOSED TO BE TAKIN OFF THE SHIP AND WE WERE GIVING IT TO THE DUTCH CIVILIANS BECAUSE THEY WERE AS STARVED AS HELL AND LOOKED VERY ILL AND ON THIS OCCASION WE GOT ASHORE AND I SAW A VERY THIN AGG LOOKING WOMAN COMING UP THE STREET PUSHING HER BATTERED PRAM AND SHE GOT TWO LITTLE KIDS IN THERE ABOUT THREE OR A BIT LESS I SUPPOSE AND ONE BLANKET COVER THEM AND I DOFFED MY HATS GOOD DAY AND SHE GAVE ME A SMILE SHE COULDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH AND I COULDN'T SPEAK DUTCH BUT I TOOK OUT WHAT I HAD AND I PUT IT IN HER PRAM YOU SHOULD AVE SEEN THE LOOK ON HER FACE SHE MUST HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS CHRISTMAS COME TICE ECAUS WHAT THEY DIDN'T EAT THEY COAL ALWAYS TRADE FOR SOMETHING ELSE COULD AV GONE BACK WITH MORE BUT IT WASN'T TO BE AFTER WE GOT RID OF MOST OF THE MINES OFF THE DUTCH COAST WE HAD ERM A WEEK'S LEAVE DEU WELL OBVIOUSLY WE WEREN'T COMING BACK HERE FOR IT A WE WOULD BE ON THE DUTCH COAST AND ER I HAD ANOTHER FELLOW WE GOT ONTO THE MAIN ROAD WHICH WAS THE BRUSSELS ROAD LEADING TO INTO BELGIUM AND THUMBED LIFTS FROMARMY LORS WHICH WARE ALWAYS GOING UP AND DOWN AND WE GOT INTO ERM ABOUT THREE THREE HOURS NO A BIT LESS INTO BROUGE WHICH IS ONE OF THEM WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SITIES I'VE SEEN GOT TWO CATHEDRALS AND OPERA HOUSE AND THE TOWN HALL ROUND FOUR SIDES OF THE MAIN SQUARE AND ER ONE OF THE HOTELS HAD BEEN TAKEN OVER AS A NAPPY FOR THE TROOPS BED AND BREAKFAST SO WE STAYED THERE AND E WE ENJOYED OURSELVES THEN WHEN WE CAME BACK WE GOT ORDERED BACK TO THIS COUNTRY AND WE WERE STILL LOOKING FOR MINES WHICH MIGHT HAVE ESCAPED DETECTION GOING UP AND DOWN BUT THERE WASN'T E MUCH URGENCY IN IT ANY MORE AND ERM I DID PUT IN APPLICATION TO SIT FRO LEADING STEWARD BUT BEFORE THAT COULD TAKE PLACE MY DISCHARGE PAPERS CAME THROUGH AND THAT WAS IN THE ER EARLY EARLY NINETEEN SIXFORTY NINETEEN FORTY SIX NINETEEN NINETEEN FORTY SIX YES AFTER THE WAR YEAH BUT UNLIKE THE ARMY OR THE AIRFORTE WE GOT PLENTY OF NOTICE WHEN IT WAS COMING I KNOW PEOPLE IN THE AIRFORCE AND THEY WERE GIVEN THREE DAYS NOTICE OM THERE AND THEY WERE OUT BUT IN THE NAVY WE HAD TIME E YOU WERE TOLD YOU'VE GOT TO BE DEMOBBED IN THREE MONTHS WELL THEY GIVES YOU TIME TO START LOOKING AROUND FOR A CIVILIAN JOB OR SOMEWHERE TO LIVE IF YOU'RE MARRIED WITH KIDS SO I THINK WE HAD A BETTER DEAL CAN YOU EXPLAIN YOU YOU TALK ABOUT THIS MINE SWEEPING JUST EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WERE DOING AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE MINES WELL LOOKED LIKE YARDS FROM THE MAIN MAST STRETCHED OUT EITHER SIDE ABOUT FIFTY FEET AND FROM THESE AR DEPENDING VERY SHARP CUTTING WIRES WITH WEIGHTS ON THE END AS YOU GO THO THE WATER THE IDEA IS TO YOUR CUTTING WIRES TO CATCH THE MOORING WIRES FOR A MINE AND CUT IT THE MINE COMES TO THE SURFACE AND YOU ULD DISPOSE OF IT HOW MANY MINES WOULD YOU FIND ON A AN AVERAGE DAY ON ABUAY ERM POSSIBLY A DOZEN POSSIBLY ONLY TWO IT VARIED AND THE DISPOSAL WOULD BE A SHOT WOULD IT OR THAT'S WHAT IT STARTED WITH YES THEN THE GERMANS EVENTUALLY ERM ACOUSTIC MINE WHICH ERM WASN'T MORED IT WAS JUST DROPPED IN THE CHANNEL HOPEFULLY IN THE PATH OF ONCOMING SHIPS AND IT EMITTED A MAGNETIC FIELD FROM ERM BATTERIES THAT WERE INSIDE AND EVERY SHIP AS IT GOES ALSO MAKES A MAGNETIC FIELD AND WHEN THE TWO COLLIDE THE MINE GOES UP SO WE HAD TO HAVE WHAT WAS CALLED DGASING EQUIPMENT A SPECIAL COIL FITTED RIGHT ROUND THE SHIP AND THE CURRENT IS PASSED THROUGH THAT ANTICLOCHWISE AND THAT NULLIFIES THE EFFECT OF THE ELECTRONIC FIELD AND YOU COULD GO OVER MINES YOU'D BE ALRIGHT COULD YOU FIND THOSE MINES WE FOUND HIM YES OUT SOMETIMES THE GERMANS GOT CRAFTED AND THEY DROPPED SOME OF THESE MINES AT NIGHT FROM LOW FLYING PLANES AND WE GOT BACK I WASN'T THERE I WAS ON A COUPLE O DAYS LEAVE AND I WENT HOME TO MAIDSTONE BUT EM I WAS TOLD AS OUR SQUADRON CAME BACK FROM PATROL ANDTHE LAST SHIP IN SLID INTO ITS PLACE ON THE JETTI AND PROBABLY BLEW UP BECAUSE THERE WAS A MINE UNDERNEATH BEIN DROPPED BY A PLANE AND THE SKIPPER OF THIS LAST BOAT AS IT WAS ON WAS SIX FEET FROM THE JETTI HE GOT HIS DEGAUZI EQUIPMENT SWITCHD OFF I THINK THERE WAS TWO SURVIVORS BUT WHO THEY WERE I DON'T KNOW BUT HOW WOULD YOU FIND I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD FIND A MINE THAT WAS FLOATING IN THE WATER YOU CUT IT AND IT FLOATS TO THE TOP HOW DID YOU FIND THESE MAGNETIC MINES WERE THEY ON THE BOTTOM OR THEY'RE ON THE BOTTOM YES HOW WOULD YOU FIND THAT WELL WE ER LIKE A SONARD DEVICE IT PICKS UP THE RADIATIONS FROM THE MINE AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHERE IT IS E CAN DROP A DEPTH CHARGE ON IT YOU SET THE DEPTH CHARGED FOR TWENTY FEET OR THIRTY WHATEVER IT IS AND JUST ERM POPPD THEM OVER THE SIDE ON A WY GUN IN HOLLAND WHEN YOU GOT TO HOLLAND YOU TALKED TO LITTLEBID ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW WERE THERE ANY OTHER MEMORIES OF JUST THE DEVASTATION WHEN THE GERMANS GOT OUT ARR THEY TOOK EVERYONE WITH THEM ALIVE OR DEAD AND BLEW A COUPLE OF BRIDGES AND THEN RETREATED TOWARDS BELGIUM DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE WINNING THE WAR AT THAT STAGE YES THE GREAT DAY HAD COME THE INVASION HAD STARTED AND WE WERE PUSHING IN LAND FROM THE BEACHES WE HADN'T BEEN SHOVED BACK OFF AGAIN AND IT WAS STARTING TOTO TO BITE WHEN YOU WERE PULLED OUT OF DDA DID YOU WERE YOU WERE YOU ABLE TO HEAR WHAT WAS GOING ON ON D DA AFTER THE BATTLESHIPS HAD ARRIVED YOU'D COME BACK TO BASE DIDN'T YOU WERE YOU AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO HEAR THETHE GUNS GOING ON THE ER WHEN THE MEN BROADSIDE STARTED YES I THINK THAT WAS ERM QUARTER TO SIX AND EIGHT MILES OF SHIPS ALL OPENED UP AT THE SAME TIN AND WE ALREADY GOT INFORMATION FROM THE UNDERGROUND AN RESISTANCE WORKERS WHERE THE GERMAN STRONG POINTS WERE ALL ALONG THE CLIFF TOPS HEAVY GUN INPLACEMENTS BUNKERS FOR TROOPS AND SO ON AND THEY GOT CONTINUOUS PLASTERING AND THEY HADN'T QUITE FINISHED IT WAS E TWO HOUR BOMBARDMENT AND ABOUT HALF AN HOUR FORE IT STOPPED THE BOATS WERE GOING ASHORE WITH THE TROOPS DID YOU HEAR IT WE WERE ON THE M PEOPE BEHIND THEM WE HEARD IT ALRIGHT WAS SUCH A DEFINITE CRESCENDO OF NORS THEREAS NOT NOTHING LIKE IT YOU WEREN'T EVEN NEAR IT NO WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER V E DAY OH THAT WAS AGAIN MARVELLOUS I WAS WAITING DE MOB AND OF COURSE WE GOT RATHER MORE LEAVE ONCE PEACE WAS DECLARED AND I GOT ERM I THINK IT WAS A FOUR DAY PASS TO GO HOME TO MAIDSTONE AND E CAME UP ON THE TRAIN O VICTORIA AND ER THE PLACE WAS JUST ONE SEETHING MASS OF PEOPLE EVERY COLOUR EVERY UNIFORM EVERY THING YOU COULD THINK OF EVERYONE WAS SINGING DANCING LAUGHING AND WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS BECAUSE THEY LET THE HAIR DOWN AND IN FRONT OF THE BUCKINGHAM PALACE YOU COULDN'T HAVE GOT A SHEE HORNIN THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND STRETCHING BACK DOWN THEM ALL WAITING FOR THE KING AND QUEEN AND WINSTON TO COME ON THE BALCONY AND THE ROYR THAT WENT UP MUST HAVE GONE ON FOR ABOUT TEN FIFTEEN MINUTES NON STOP HOW DO YOU REFLECT ON YOUR NAVY SERVICE NOW I'M G I'M GLAD I WENT IT MEANS I AD THOUSANDS OF OTHERS O DON HAVE TO READ ABOUT HISTORY WE WERE MAKING IT WE WERE PART OF THAT HISTORY AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO BE PROUD OF ARE THERE ANY OTHER STORIES YOU WANT TO SHARE I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY NO AS I SAY MIND USEEVENIS A VERY DULL OCCUPATION WITH OCCASIONAL SHORT PERIODS OF ACTIVITY BUT E UNLIKE DESTROYERS OR BATTLE SHIPS YO YOU'RE NOT ENGAGED PERMANENTLY WITH WITH THE OPPOSITE NUMBER WERE THERE ANY OCCASIONS WHERE YOU WERE ENGAGED NO WE WERE NEVER ATTACKED BY PLANES AS I SAID AND ER WE DIDN'T SEE ANY GERMAN TROOPS THE ONLY CONTACT WE HAD WAS WHEN THEIR LONG RANGE GUNS ON THE FRENCH COAST TRIED TO GET US WHILE WE WERE MINE SWEEPING BUT THE THEY DIDN'T
