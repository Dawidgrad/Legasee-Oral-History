my name is john does westwood i'm eighty nine years old i was born on the seventh of april nineteen twenty four when is the service i had originally joined to be a signaller and they found out i was colorblind so i was automatically transferred to the stupidity branch which i didn't want but you had no choice you did what you were told and i got transferred to minesweepers and i was based on the isle of sheppey at queensborough queensland queenborough pier and we had about ten three but everyone out every couple of days to sweep any mines have been dropped by the boats innova singing our supplies ships why did you join the navy at the time i was set was a call in the reserved occupation i was an apprentice as an electrical engineer and my dad didn't want me to do cos you're not even as in the last war i would prefer me to learn a good steady trade but i wanted to go so as soon as i was eighteen i went over from maidstone where home was i came over to chatham the pembroke barracks and signed up i said i was nineteen better it doesn't matter because i just accepted you if you good at breathing out livia arms you're physically fit but i told you get home and wait and i'll be contacted and about a week later they overcame report to chatham barracks on sutton saturday i went right through the wall without actually seeing german we're has a long race face remember and german you wanted to do your bit but why did you not join the army or the raf i'm not interested in either traditional family and my father was in the navy so is my grandfather and uncle my grandfather was on bt as flagship for live at the battle of jutland i need any come on deck for three days he was in the engineering branch but that's the service i wanted to join so i did and what do you remember if you're training robin is rather confused when you're young and you don't take he's in so easily pembroke house pembroke barracks we were all marge down to the further down the yeah but we got fitted out at that time everyone a less of an ulcer wore the same for an hour free with bell bottoms the scarf and the and the that says up to skegness with another bunch to butlins holiday camp whenever came hms royal arthur and i was to start them training telegraphist secretly hello been doing morse code just started on the morse code for battle fortnite then somebody's is over akala december have it most of them pass for two hours and me we're also strongly colorblind so you're out if you send the wrong colours when you're signaling it could be a disaster so that's what i was transferred on the mines free bros on the stewarding branch will you disappointed yes nobody like being on my favours we all kept putting in for transferred to something more glamorous destroyers submarines mgb mgb how many people are in one of these minesweepers the boat like five offices and about twelve fifteen crew all inclusive the engineers under snooker branch they call it then the signal and and there is doing the actual mind detecting when we first started in went out mine sweetie it was three days on one day off and we had to see man standing in the bowels with rifles when they saw mine that was flavouring by they should had it hit the holes and blow it up but that was when they started the minesweeping campaign and the germans when they drop them had a long way over the service to hit the ship it one of those wires came loose to the mind of the service and there's one of these we look for each time we went out when the germans occupy france across got rise on the coastline and they had big guns at the captain karina and he used to pop away that's every time i'm out unfortunately we never got hit there was one i music and it is dead commodore had been acu captain before the war he retired a course even brought back in and they commodore of the minesweeping fleet harris twelve minesweepers and we used to do the same thing everyday a german is being very meticulous will come out will say friday and chooses the same the same time to write their minds and then dash back in and out the following morning it's time to pick them up i got a bit fed up with this and it's only converts of his catherine's one day is it next time bo three thing brand new trolls out but don't drop her wise which is the coldest country all naval instructions equally got a court martial have any happened but we went through the german mindfield as i'm going away with it so pyjamas came out in to replace the ninth they thought we picked up and the lost for their own boats on their own minds and i don't think i saw that was very sporty demented somewhere in the admiralty archives good idea he could have got rid of a great deal of trouble for that what was your role what were you doing when we went out i was doodle poll with the six largest us we reported to the first lieutenant but damage control party if the ship got hit we had a clear the damage away put it on ne five and pull the world into the water where the doctor was waiting to do what he could but fortunately never happened but that my official station what about bad weather and storms and stuff do you ever encounter any dangers when you have what we had some yes but still went out you just yourself that was it we are safety lines read foreign out so you wouldn't get washed overboard what about would you was it was it what was it like watching the planes taking going over you and stuff did you see much activity in the air we went and never got attacked from the air i don't know anyway worth wasting your bomb on they wanted in for the capital cities all their fields are you involved in d day at all yes now a week before d day the base was shut down like an oyster know where you can go off you really know why he was allowed in because you couldn't get any post you could make any phone calls because it was coming up there officially we didn't know that and for about three months before dj elaborate instructors which started night sweeping as an alternative to the day shift so it must be getting used to the ideas popping along with during the hours adele disabled the in your head so the early morning you dj we run out the midnight and we were sleeping right up to the line where the battleships were waiting to bombard the coast where you exactly where they were going to be stationed and we swear most carefully and then we as a study come out of the darkness from two in the morning and waiting and we retired behind them there was nothing else for us to do we got sent back here to the chevy when the troops went to show with a bit annoyed because you weren't doing anything and then about eight or nine days later i got the orders to patrol the dutch coast on the shelf and pick up all the mines with the germans to the so liberally round all the the coast there so that kept us busy for about three weeks and we were associated a little town called susan a very small port but there was it a long jetty so more outside there and in evenings late afternoon you got surely until you were going up again next morning and i never her garden the things we saw we rather sure as i got out the harry and that their signs everywhere hotel lounge that there been an officers mess and the signs are still up and then blue some of him bridges over four as a lift and the dutch flooded some of the dice to stop there heavy traffic getting away remember once we went ashore we all carry navy raincoat draped over your arm and the also watching you very well we are things in the pockets cigarettes packet of biscuits attila gem or whatever wish where is not supposed to be taken off the ship and we will give it to the dutch surnames because they were starved as hell and look very ill and on this occasion we gotta show and i saw a very thin looking woman coming up the street pushing her about a pram and she got two little kids in there about three or a bit less asbos and one blanket cover them and i don't mads a good day and she gave me a smile she couldn't speak english and i couldn't speak dutch but i took out but i had and you should have seen the look on her face gymnastics oliver's christmas come twice what i didn't eat i can always try for somebody else is gone back with more button it wasn't to be after we got rid of most of the minds of the dutch coast we had a a week sleeved you will obviously we won't coming back here it would be on the dutch coast and another fellow we go onto the main road which was the brussels road leading into into her belgium and family lives with always going up and down and we got in about three three hours a bit less into bruges which one that was one of the most people say that i've seen he's got two cathedrals and opera house and the town hall round four sides of the main square and one of the hotels have been taken over as a nappy for the troops bed breakfast so we stayed there and where joists are cells and when we came back we got all the back to this country and we're still looking for mine's rizmo the escape detection going up and down but it wasn't urgent see in it anymore and i did put in application to sit for leading steward a before that that could take place my discharge papers came through and that was in the early early ninety forty nineteen forty six ninety six years but unlike the army or the air force we got plenty of notice when it was coming i know people in the edibles i never giving three days notice and then they were out in the navy we had time where you told you got to be the model in three months what age is your time to start looking around for a civilian job or somewhere to live if you're married with kids i think we had a better deal can you explain you talk about this minesweeping just explain what you were doing and what happens to these minds you look like it yeah is it from the main driver side about fifty ft and from movies at the tenth very shop cutting wires with weights on the end and as you go to the war the idea is your cathie wires to catch the moray wires for a mine and custard the mine comes to the service and you just photos of it how many miles would you find on a an average day on average possibly jasmine possibly only two if there is and a disposal would be a shop with it all that's what you started with yes then the germans adventures acoustic mind which was amoreiras just dropped in the channel hopefully in the path of oncoming ships and it is it mrs of magnetic field from batteries that were inside and every ship is it goes also makes a magnetic field and when the two collide the money goes up so we had have always called decals in the equipment that special coil is it right round the ship and a card is passed through that anticlockwise and the effect of the electric field and you can go over mines and you'll be alright some time do the germans got crabs and they drop some of these mine's at the night from low flying planes and we got back i was louder only couple of days leave in that way home to maidstone but i was told as asked warren came back from patrol and the last ship inn cylinder which place on the jetty and probably blow up there was a minor been dropped by a plane and the skipper this last boat as a result is sixty from the jetty he got his switch it off i think there was two survivors very really where i don't know how would you find i can understand how you could find a mind that was floating in the water you cut it and it floats to the top how did you find these magnetic minds were they on the bottom there on on the bottom yes well isn't love like a sonar device it picks up the the radiations from the mind and you will say exactly where it is then you can drop it off charge on it you set the depth charge for twenty three or thirty whatever it is i'm just put them over the sides on a y gun in holland when you got to holland you talk to little bit about what you saw are there any other memories of just the devastation when the germans going to get around with him alive or dead i'm blue a couple of bridges and then retreated towards belgium did you feel like you are winning the war that stage yes the great day oh come the invasion has started and we were pushing a land from the beaches we haven't been shot back over you and it was starting to do to b when you were pulled out of dj did you you were you able to hear what was going on on d day after the battle ships of the rise you come back to base around long enough to hear that is going off when i take that was five hundred and forty five and eight miles of ships all opened up at the same time and we already got information from the underground resistance workers where the german strong points were or along the cliff tops heavy gun in placement bankers for troops and so on and they got continuous plastering and they had me quite finished it was two hour half an hour for it stopped the boats were going to show with the troops did you hear it but we were on the man's mind and weird is alright it was such a definitely for a sender of noise nothing like it veneer it no what do you remember ve day i was away she did bob and because he got rather more leave once peace was declared and i've dropped i think it was a four day pass to go home to maidstone and it came up on me the train the victoria and the price was just one cv mass of people every calorie ever uniform every thing you were single everyone was singing dancing laughing and with complete strangers because they let the hair down and in front of buckingham palace you could have got a shoe on in hundreds of thousands stressing back down the mall waiting for the king and queen and the come on the balcony and the role that went out must be going on for about ten fifteen minutes stop eddie reflect on your navy service now i'm i'm glad i went means i and tells about to read about history we will making it a part of that history and i did it's something to be proud of are there any other stories you want to share i don't hear any new as i say minus even as a very dalkey patient with occasional short periods of activity but i'd like to battleships you engaged permanently with the opposite number was there any occasions where you were engaged no we're never attacked by planes they said under regency nujoma truce the only kind out where was when they're long range guns on the french coast tried to get us while we were minesweeping but they didn't
