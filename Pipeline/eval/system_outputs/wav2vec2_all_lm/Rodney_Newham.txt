MY NAME IS RODNEY NEWNHAM AND I WAS BORN IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND I E WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN I HAD AN APPRENTICESHIP IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD AND FOR FIVE YEARS AND THEN I SERVED A TIME AND ON MOST OF THE SHIPS THAT CAME IN ON REPAIRING I WAS IN THE BOILER MAKING TRADE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE THE BOILER ROOMS AND ENGINE ROOMS WERE THE ONES THAT I WAS EMPLOYED IN AND I KNEW MORE ABOUT SHIPS AND SOME OF THE SAILORS KNEW BECAUSE I USED TO KNOW EVERY PART OF THE SHIP EVEN DOWN INTO THE SHAFT ROOM THE CHARTER IT WOULD GO THROUGH AND DRIVE THE PROPELLER AND AND ONE OF MY JOB WAS TO PUT SAFETY SHIELDS OVER THE JOINTS OF THE SHAFT GOING THROUGH THE SHIP AND I KNEW ABOUT MOST OF THE SHIP AND WERE DIFFERENT THE ENGINE AND BOILER ROOM MORE THAN ANYTHING AND THE AIR SUPPLIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHEN I WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN WE SAT EXAMS FOR ARTIFICER APPRENTICES OR DOCKYARD APPRENTICES AND AT THAT TIME I WANTED TO GO INTO THE NAVY BUT IN THAT AT THAT TIME THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT YOU IN THE ENGINE ROOM ARTIFICE IF YOU HAD GLASSES BECAUSE THE SHIPS IN THOSE DAY A LOT OF STEAM CAME FROM THE BOILERS SO YOU NEVER YOU COULDN'T DO IT SO I WENT THEN AS AN APPRENTICE IN IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD AND I SERVED FIVE YEARS THAT WAS NINETEEN THIRTY SIX DAYS WHEN YOU EVEN WHEN YOU CAME OUT OF THE DOCKYARD GATES CHILDREN WERE BEGGING THERE IN BARE FEET FOR YOUR SANDWICHES THAT YOU HAD OVER AND YOU USED TO GIVE THEM TO THE CHILDREN WHO WERE THERE WAITING FOR THE DOCKYARD PEOPLE TO COME OUT SO THAT THEY COULD GET THESE SANDWICHES IT DOESN'T SEEM POSSIBLE DOES IT BUT THAT'S TRUE YES I HAD A SISTER WHO WAS SEVEN YEARS OLDER AND I HAD A BROTHER WHO WAS SEVEN YEARS YOUNGER AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM I NEVER KNEW I NEVER KNEW BUT MY SISTER SHE SHE LIVED TO ABOUT EIGHTY THREE I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN MY SISTER YES AND MY FATHER WAS A CHIEF ENGINE ROOM ARTIST IN A NAVY HE DID HIS TWENTY TWO YEARS YOU KNOW AND AND MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS EIGHT SO I NEVER REALLY KNEW HER MOTHER'S LOVE AND CARE FROM THE AGE OF EIGHT NO SO I CAN'T SAY I HAD A HAPPY CHILDHOOD AS SUCH NOT HAVING A MOTHER'S CARE AND WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF YOUR EARLY APPRENTICESHIP IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD WHAT WERE YOU ACTUALLY WAS THERE A SENSE OF WAR I MEAN WERE YOU WAS IT BACK WERE YOU BUILDING UP FOR WAR OR WAS IT JUST YOU KNOW A JOB FOR YOU AT THE TIME WELL IT WAS NINETEEN THIRTY SIX I WENT INTO THE DOCKYARD I WAS AN APPRENTICE FOR FIVE YEARS APPRENTICESHIP THIRTY SIX SO IN THAT TIME THE WAR BROKE OUT THIRTY NINE DIDN'T IT THAT'S RIGHT AND SO I WAS SERVING THE APPRENTICESHIP ACTUALLY WHEN THE WAR BROKE OUT YES WELL IT WAS WHEN I FINISHED I WAS THEN A QUALIFIED BOILER MAKER WHICH WAS A HARD JOB HAD WORK SO I DETERMINED AT THAT TIME BUT I WOULDN'T STAY AS A BOILER MAKER SO I MADE PROGRESS IN THE TRADE AND I EVENTUALLY BECAME AN INSPECTOR OF TRADES IN IN THE DOCKYARD THAT THAT'S WHAT I RETIRED AS AN INSPECTOR OF TRADES ERM IT'S THE APPRENTICESHIP OF THE BOILER MAKER WAS A HARD JOB IT WAS A HEAVY HEAVY MATERIAL JOB AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE BOILERS THEY WEREN'T MODERN THEY WERE WHAT WE USED TO CALL YARROW BOILERS AND CYLINDRICAL BOILERS MADE OF METAL ABOUT AN INCH THICK AND WE USED TO ROLL IT INTO SHAPE AND MIND YOU THEY WERE BIG THEY WERE UP TO THIRTY TON BECAUSE THE CRANES USED TO HAVE TO LIFT THAT YES IT WAS IT WAS HEAVY HARD WORK BOILER MAKING WAS YES I KNOW OF A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE KILLED WHEN ONE HE HAD A PLATE DROPPED FROM A CRANE SLIPPED OUT OF THE OF THE GRIP AND FELL ON HIM AND KILLED HIM YES TERRIBLE AND AND I REMEMBER A MAN BEING KILLED ON THE THE CRANES THEY USED TO GO UP AND DOWN ON RAILS LIFTING LIFTING THIRTY ODD TONE AND ONE MAN WAS CRUSHED UP ON THE LINE AND IT WAS IT WAS A NAVAL OFFICER WHO ACTUALLY WENT UP THERE UP THE STEPS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE STEPS WERE LOCKED SO THAT NO OTHER PEOPLE COULDN'T GET BUT HE WENT UP THERE TO RETRIEVE THE BODY OR TO SEE IF HE COULD DO ANYTHING FOR THE BODY A VERY BRAVE A NAVAL OFFICER LIEUTENANT HE WAS A PLANE AS IF IT WAS YESTERDAY DAY YES YES HE WAS AND IT WAS HARD SOMETHING I'M QUITE INTERESTED IN RODNEY IS OBVIOUSLY CHATHAM BECAME A VERY VERY BUSY DOCKYARD DURING THE WAR YES DID YOU NOTICE YOU KNOW DID YOU NOTICE TO TALK A BIT ABOUT THIS ESCALATION IN THE AMOUNT OF WORK IN TERMS OF PROVIDING FOR THE WAR EFFORT ERM WELL THERE WAS A NUMBER OF VESSELS USED TO COME IN FOR DAMAGE BECAUSE OF WAR AND THEY WOULD BE REPAIRED IN IN CHATHAM DOCKYARD AND ERM AND THEY WE USED TO DO MAKE GUN SHIELDS AND TORPEDO PLATFORMS REVOLVED FOR THE TORPEDOES ON AND WE USED TO DO THOSE MAKE THOSE PLATFORMS FOR TORPEDO TO BE FIRED FROM AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND GUN SHIELDS WE USED TO MAKE MADE OF ERM BULLETPROOF METAL WHICH WAS VERY HARD TO WORK WITH YOU KNOW BEING HARD ON ANY OF THEM BECAME YEAH THE ARITHUISER WAS A CRUISE I WORKED ON AND THE LANDING WAS ANOTHER CRUISER AND AND A NUMBER OF FRIGATES AND A MINE SWEEPERS AND THEN WHEN WE USED TO DO THE REFITS AND THAT WOULD MEAN STRIPPING OUT THE BOILER AND ENGINE ROOMS AND RENEWING A LOT OF THE STUFF THE AIR SUPPLY THROUGH THE VENTILATION AND TO THE ENGINE AND BOILER ROOMS THROUGH TURBO GENERATORS THAT COLLECTED THE AIR AND DISTRIBUTED IT AROUND THE SHIP YES THAT WAS ALL ALUMINIUM TRUNK WITH GRILLS ON THE END OF THE TRUNK YOU COULD ALTER DIFFERENT POSITIONS IN THE ENGINE AND BOILER ROOMS YES AND USED TO MAKE THOSE GRILLS AND FIT THEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT I REMEMBER THE GERMANS COMING OVER WITH QUITE A NUMBER OF THEM I REMEMBER THE AIR AND THE ARITHUSA A CRUISER OPENED OPENED FIRE ON THEM AND I THINK I THINK A LOT OF THE CRAFT WERE ITALIANS I THINK THAT CAME OVER BECAUSE IT WAS NOTICEABLE THAT THE GERMANS WOULD HAVE GONE ON BUT WHEN THE ARITHUSAR OPENED FIRE ON THEM A LOT OF THESE PLANES CHANGED AND TURNED AROUND AND WENT BACK FROM WHERE THEY COME FROM YOU NEVER BELIEVE IT WOULD BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED YES THE GERMANS WOULD HAVE KEPT ON AND WOULD HAVE ATTACKED THEIR TARGET I THINK SOME OF THE OTHERS WERE ITALIANS YES BECAUSE WHERE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN IN A SHORTER I STOOD UP AGAINST ONE OF THE WORKSHOP WALLS AND THAT WAS MY SHELTER AND WATCHED THE ARITHUSA OPEN UP AND SHE WAS IN DOCK AND SHE OPENED UP AND I STOOD THERE WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL OF THE WORKSHOP AND SAW THESE MEN ON THE ARTHOUSE STRIPPED TO THE FIRING THE SHIPS AND GETTING THE SHOW EMPTY SHOTS AND THROWING THEM ASIDE AND UNLOADING AGAIN AND FIRING THAT WAS ONLY ARTHUS YES THEY WERE THEY REALLY GOOD THEY WERE THEY REALLY REALLY TURNED THE PLANE AROUND AND EXPERIENCE YOU BECAUSE I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN DOWN IN A SHELTER AND I DIDN'T GO DOWN THERE YES I WAS GIVEN ONE TO GO TO WHICH WAS JUST A WELL DUG OUT AND YOU WENT DOWN STEPS AND THAT WAS THERE BUT I WOULDN'T GO DOWN THE THING AND I STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL OF THE WORKSHOP YES NOT THAT I WAS BRAVE AT ALL IT'S JUST THAT I WOULDN'T GO DOWN IN A SHELTER I'D RATHER TAKE MY CHANCE IN THE WAR WHEN YOU WEREN'T IN THE DOCKYARD OR WERE YOU LIVING IN THE DOCKYARD AS WELL NO I M I LIVED OUTSIDE OF THE DOCKYARD YES I LIVED IN GILLINGHAM ROAD FOR A TIME NEAR THE RAILWAY CROSSING YOU KNOW THAT PART OF GILLINGHAM I LIVED WITH MY FATHER THERE YES BECAUSE MY MOTHER DIED WHEN I WAS EIGHT BUT I WENT WITH MY DAD WE I THINK WE KNEW THAT WE WOULD PUT IT LIKE THIS WIN IN THE END YOU KNOW THAT WE WOULD BE THE VICTORS AS A NATION BECAUSE I THINK THE EFFORT EVERYBODY WAS BEHIND THE WAR EFFORT AS FAR AS I KNOW YES YES THAT I SUPPOSE YOU AS YOU YOU WEREN'T PAID A LOT OF MONEY ERM YOU YOU WERE SOME PEOPLE MADE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE OF THE WAR THAT BUT WE WERE NEVER LIKE THAT WE NEVER MADE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE OF THE WAR BEING ON AND IT

FURNACE AND PULL PULL RINGS OUT OF THE FURNACE AND ROUND THEM UP AND YOU USED TO HAVE TO HAVE AN STI SHEET TO SHIELD YOU OUT FROM THE HEAT THAT CAME OFF WHEN YOU PULLED IT OUT WITH RAKES ONTO A SLAB FROM THE FURNACE AND THE HEAT WAS SO GREAT THAT YOU USED TO HOLD THIS SHEETS UP IN FRONT OF YOU TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE HEAT AS YOU ENDEAVOURED WITH LARGE LARGE HAMMERS TO SHAPE TO TO MAKE THEM INTO THE RIGHT SHAPE SOMETIMES THEY WEREN'T QUITE ROUND AND SO YOU HAD TO PUT DOGS ON THEM AND SHAPE THEM YOU JUST HAD ASBESTOS SHEETS TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE HEAT AND THE THING WAS THAT YOU AS
