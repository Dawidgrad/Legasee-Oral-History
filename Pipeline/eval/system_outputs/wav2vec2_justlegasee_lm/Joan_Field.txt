FROM NINETEEN FORTY ONE TO NINETEEN FORTY FIVE BASICALLY WESTERN APPROACHES THAT INCLUDES PLYMOUTH RIGHT THE WAY UP THE UP TO SCOTLAND TOP OF SCOTLAND AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME JON FIELD I WAS JON ROSE ONE WHERE ARE YOU FROM AND WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO YOU WELL I ACTUALLY WAS BORN IN CAMBRIDGESHIRE IN A LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED MELDRET I THINK IT WAS FIFTEENTH CENTURY THATCHED COTTAGE WHICH WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S SMALL HOLDING WAS BORN THERE MY PARENTS WORKED ON A SMALL HOLDING IN NINETEEN THIRTY THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR WE MOVED TO THE NEW TOWN OF WELLING GARDEN CITY WHERE MY FATHER GOT EMPLOYMENT AND I LIVED THERE AND WENT TO SCHOOL THERE I WANT A SCHOLARSHIP IN A BURSARY TO SHEETS WOOD HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS IN WELLING GARDEN CITY AND I MATRICULATED AT WHICH WAS THEN I CALL THE MATRICULATION I WAS THEN SEVENTEEN I WANTED TO JOIN THE WAR HAD BROKEN OUT BY THEN OBVIOUSLY I WANTED TO JOIN THE WRENS I WENT DOWN AND THOUGHT WELL HOPEFULLY GET IN THE WRENS IF NOT I'LL HAVE TO GO INTO THE WAFT BUT THEY ACCEPTED ME INTO THE WRENS AT THE TIME THEY WERE ONLY TAKING ON COOKS AND STEWARDS WHICH OF COURSE I DID NOT WANT TO DO I HAD AN EYE TEST AND THEY DECIDED I GOT PERFECT EYESIGHT THEN AND SO I WAS TOLD I WAS GOING TO BE A SIGNAL AND I DIDN'T MEAN MUCH TO ME BUT I DIDN'T MIND WHAT IT WAS AND I WAS CALLED UP JUST A MONTH BEFORE CHRISTMAS TO HMS CABLE WHICH IS UP IN WARRINGTON WHAT YEAR WAS THAT I'M JUST TRYING TO THINK NINETEEN I THINK IT WAS NINETEEN FORTY ONE IN THE MIDDLE OF NINETEEN FORTY ONE I THOUGHT IS MARVELLOUS ALL THE OFFICERS AT CHRISTMAS WERE WAITING ON TOUGH THIS IS A LOVELY IDEA THIS IS BECAUSE I WAS SHORT LIVED IT WAS VERY TOUGH AT CABLE YOU WERE GIVEN TWO WEEKS TO WHAT THEY CALL PROBATION AND YOU WERE GIVEN ALL THE DIRTY JOBS TO DO OVAL SCRUBBING THE FLOORS CLEAN THE LOOS IT WAS MAKE ALL BREAK TIME A SQUAD DRILLING UNTIL SQUADRON HATED SQUADRON BUT I GOT TO LOVE IT ACTUALLY AFTER THAT BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY THE END OF THE FORTNIGHT WE WERE ACCEPTED SOME OF THEM WENT HOME SOME OF THEM WENT A WALL IF YOU WENT A WALL THEN YOU JUST WENT INTO MUNITIONS OR WHATEVER BUT IF YOU DIDN'T REALLY LIKE IT PERHAPS THE WA WOULD HAVE HAD YOU WE WERE FIRST CHOICE IN THOSE DAYS EVERYBODY WANTED TO GO IN THE WRENS SO I STARTED MY VISUAL SIGNALLING AND CODING DID SOME CODING AS WELL BUT BASICALLY VISUAL SIGNALLING AND THE COURSE LASTED I THINK FOR SIX MONTHS WAS IT ABOUT SIX MONTHS FOUR MONTHS FOUR MONTHS I THINK AT THAT TIME AFTER THAT TIME YOU WENT ON LEAVE YOU WERE THEN DRAFTED TO DIFFERENT PLACES WE ALL OR PUT DOWN FOR PLYMOUTH ALL WANTED TO COME SOUTH I LIVED THERE IN WHEN IN GOLDEN CITY OBVIOUSLY IT WAS SOUTH I WANT IT I ENDED UP IN OBAN I NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT I HAD TO FIND IT ON THE MAP WHEN I GOT THE DRAFT I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE IT WAS FOUND IT TOUGH THIS IS LOVELY TO BE LOVELY UP THERE CAN I GO BACK A LITTLE BIT YOU SOUND YOU WERE EMPHATIC THAT YOU WANTED TO JOIN THE WRENS OR ANY OTHER SERVICE WHY I DON'T KNOW I'VE GOT NO NAVAL MY FATHER AND MY GRANDFATHER ALL SERVED IN THE ARMY I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS I LOVED TO SEA MAY BE THE UNIFORM IT'S A BIG I DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE IN THE WRENS IT WAS JUST SOMETHING I THINK STEPHANE HAD THE SAME WHEN YOU READ HER BOOK IT'S AN ATTRACTION TO IT I SUPPOSE IN A WAY IT'S A SORT OF GLAMOUR OF THE WRENS NOW YOU MENTIONED CABAN YOU MENTION YOU KNOW I VISUALIZATION AND CODING I'D LIKE TO KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE LEARNING AND HOW YOU LEARNED VISUALIZATION AND WHAT WAS THE PROCESS WELL FIRST OF ALL GOT TO LEARN THE MORSE CODE YOU KNOW EVEN AT SEVENTEEN THAT'S A BIT TRICKY BUT STILL YOU LEARNED THE MORSE CODE AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY DRUMMED INTO THE MORSE CODE IS IT PURELY REPETITION YES REALLY AND TRULY AND YOU LEARN GIMMICKS TO LEARN IT DAD IT FACE YOU WERE DOING ALL THESE SORT OF GIMMICKY THINGS TO REMIND YOU IS TOUGH WE WERE PUT INTO CLASSES AND THE VISUAL SIGNALS CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH A V AND MY CLASS WAS VERITY AND I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT STEPS CLASS IS WHICH JUST MENTIONED IN THE BOOK THE WIRELESS TELEGRAPHERS CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH LIKE WAR SPITE AND THE CODING CLASSES ALL BEGAN WITH A C AND EACH COURSE WAS A DIFFERENT LENGTHS WE LEARNED MORSE CODE SEMAPHORE TO SIGNAL WITH FLAGS LIKE THE OLD NELSON SIGNAL WHICH KEPT CHANGING LEARNING THE PHONETIC ALPHABET WHICH HALFWAY THROUGH OUR COURSE CHANGED SO THAT THE AMERICANS COULD UNDERSTAND IT WHICH ANNOYED US WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO CHANGE AFTER ALL THESE YEARS ANYWAY THE PHONETIC ALPHABET EVERY CLASS WAS MANNED BY AN X MAN USUALLY A CHIEF WHO'D NEVER DEALT WITH WOMEN BEFORE AND SOME OF THEM WERE A BIT TOUGH A BIT TOUGH BUT IT BECAUSE WE WERE COMPLETELY RAW TO IT WE WERE TAUGHT NAVAL DISCIPLINE DIFFERENT TIME WATCHES TWENTY FOUR HOUR CLOCK WHICH OF COURSE WE HADN'T STARTED TO USE THEN THE BASICS REALLY BASICS I FOUND IT QUITE ENJOYABLE IT WAS JUST LIKE BEING AT SCHOOL REALLY WHAT ABOUT YOUR WRENNERY WHERE WERE YOU STAYING PRETTY SPARTAN BUT NOT TOO BAD IT WAS OLD NISSEN HUTS I THINK THEY'D BEEN USED BY I THINK I DEFINE MENTIONS IT IN A BOOK I THINK THEY'D BEEN USED BY THE POST OFFICE BUT THEY WERE ALL NISSEN HUTS ON THIS BIG SIGHT AT NEWTON FED JUST OUTSIDE WARRINGTON IT OBVIOUSLY NOW BEING DEVELOPED INTO A BIG HOUSING IT BUT IT WAS A VERY LARGE CAMP MOSTLY THE WRENNERY BUT THERE WERE ALSO THE MEN ON BOARD AS WELL THEY WERE LEARNING I THINK THEY WERE DOING BUT WE WERE OBVIOUSLY BEING TRAINED TO TAKE OVER SOME OF THE SIGNAL STATIONS FROM THE MEN TO RELEASE THEM WHICH WE LEARNED AFTERWARDS OBVIOUSLY I GOT MY DRAFT UP TO WHEN YOU GET A DRAFT HOW IS YOUR COMMUNICATION YOUR PARENTS AND THIS DRAFT YOU SAY OBAMA WHERE IS THAT HOW DID YOU GET THERE WHAT DID YOUR PARENTS THINK WELL A BIT STAGGERED MY MOTHER MY FATHER YES MY FATHER TOOK ME UP TO EUSTON STATION I GOT THIS DRAFT JUST A THING REPORT I SUPPOSE IT WAS A WERE PATROL POLICE UP IN EUSTON THEN I WAS SENT ON TO UM KINGS CROSS NOW I SENT WENT TO KING'S CROSS AND I HAD TO GO TO EUSTON ALL THIS MILITARY STUFF ALL IN SIVS ONLY ALLOWED TO TAKE A SUITCASE OF CLOTHES ONE ONE OUTFIT OF CIVIL CLOTHES YOU KNOW THE USUAL PAJAMAS ALWAYS PAJAMAS UM YOU KNOW THE USUAL SORT OF THING IS YOU WERE GOING INTO HOSPITAL ONLY ONE SET OF CIVILIAN CLOTHES TO REPORT TO PLACE IN ONE OF THE STATIONS I THINK IT WAS KINGS CROSS THEY TOOK ME UNDER THEIR WING AND SORTED ME OUT AND GOT ME ONTO THE TRAIN MY FATHER SAW ME OFF AND THAT WAS REALLY ALL THAT HAPPENED I ENDED UP I THOUGHT WHEREVER AM I GOING YOU YOU MILES AND MILES THERE WERE QUITE A FEW SAILORS ON GOING UP TO ME DIFFERENTLY WERE GOING BACK ON LEAVE AND THEY WERE ALL KIND TO ME THEY ALL REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING THE TRAIN WAS CROWDED AND I CAN REMEMBER WE COULDN'T SIT DOWN ANYWHERE AND ONE OF THE SAILORS PUT ME UP ONTO TOP OF THE RAT AT THE TOP SO I COULD HAVE A SLEEP I CAN ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT WE GOT TO CARLISLE AN AIR RAID WARNING AND WE HAD TO STAY IN CARLYLE SIDING FOR ABOUT AN HOUR WHICH MEANT I HAD MISSED MY TRAIN FROM CARLYLE TO STERLING WHERE I HAD TO CHANGE AGAIN SO THAT WAS ANOTHER PROBLEM JUST GOT TO STERLING AND OF COURSE THE TRAIN TO OBAN HAD GONE SO I WAS STRANDED THE S PUT ME UP IN A HOSPITAL FOR THE NIGHT AND THEN I WENT DOWN TO OBAN REPORTED TO OBAN THE OFFICER IN CHARGE AT BEN AND I WAS TOLD I WAS GOING TO THE P SIGNAL STATION IN THE MORNING GOING TO THE PR SIGNAL STATION IN THE MEANTIME OF COURSE I'D BEEN KITTED UP AT CABLE WE WERE KITTED UP BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BELL BOTTOMS THAT IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR A WREN BECAUSE IT'S SO COLD SO I WAS ISSUED WITH BELL BOTTOMS NEXT DAY I WENT ON DUTY YOU KNOW AND I THOUGHT THIS IS CRAZY ALL THIS SORT OF BUSINESS CABLE ALL THE STRICT DISCIPLINE AND NAVAL DISCIPLINE NOBODY SEEMED TO BE BOTHERED I DON'T THINK YOU THINK THEY REALIZED THERE WAS A WAR ON EXCEPT OF COURSE THE CONVOYS COMING IN I LIKED I LIKED IT I LIKED SCOTLAND STEPNEY DIDN'T LIKE IT YOU'RE READING HER BOOK IF YOU EVER READ IT DIDN'T SEEM TO MIX IN VERY WELL WITH SCOTTISH PEOPLE BUT I HAD GOT A SCOTTISH GRANDFATHER PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT I DID SORT OF ACCEPT IT MORE AND I REALIZED THAT THEY WERE A BIT INSULAR THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO BE OFF PUTTING BUT THEY WERE BECAUSE IT IS AN INSULAR LAND UP IN THE HIGHLANDS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THE HIGHLANDS VERY WELL THEY ARE A THING TO THEMSELVES WE JUST DO ME A FAVOR THEN JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BAM WHAT THE BASE WAS LIKE WHAT YOUR SURROUNDINGS LIKE WHERE YOU SLEPT IT IS OPEN AND OPEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE WORK WELL OPEN FIRST OF ALL I WAS STATIONED IN WHAT WAS CALLED THE STATION HOTEL AND THE SIGNAL STATION ON THE PIER WAS ONLY A SHORT WALK AWAY I MET UP WITH A GIRL WHO WAS GOING TO WORK WITH ME SHE'D BEEN THERE ABOUT A WEEK WE HADN'T YET STARTED REALLY GETTING THE CONVOYS IN SO WE WERE TOLD WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN BUT THE CONVOYS WOULD COME IN AND THEY'D BE IN THE BAY AND WE HAD TO MAN THE SHIP MAN THERE ALL THE TIME AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO ON ANY BOATS AND THAT'S ANOTHER THE STORY WE HAD TO MONITOR EVERYTHING COMING IN AND OUT WE ALSO HAD TO LOOK AFTER FUNNILY ENOUGH HAD THEIR SUNDERLAND AND CATALINA UP THERE AND THEY HAD A CALL SIGN WHICH CHANGED EVERY HOUR OF THEM COULD NEVER EVER READ IT SO WE USED TO HAVE TO READ THEIR SIGNAL FOR THEM TO SEND THEIR PATROL BELT OUT BUT THAT WAS UNKNOWN TO OUR BASE WHO NEVER HAD A CLUE WHAT WAS GOING ON IT WAS A CRAZY SET UP REALLY SUBMARINES ON PATROL DUTY USED TO COME IN ALONGSIDE THE PEER WE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THEM THEIR SIGNALS THEY WENT OUT ON PATROL THAT WAS MOSTLY WHAT WE WERE DOING AT THE PIER SIGNAL STATION THIS WASN'T ADEQUATE ENOUGH GANEVAN SIGNAL STATION WHICH WAS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER FROM WHERE WE WERE WAS STILL MANNED BY THE MEN AND THEY ALSO HAD A NEW ASDIC CENTER OPENING UP JUST BELOW WHICH WAS RADAR ON AS DICK THE USDA DONE BY THE MEN THE MEN WERE GOING FROM GAGNEVON AND THEY WERE GOING OVER TO LISMORE THE WRENS WEREN'T ALLOWED OUT THERE BECAUSE IT WAS COMPLETELY ALONE OUT THERE IT WAS NO HABITATION EXCEPT A FEW A FEW SHEEP FARMERS THE WRENS WEREN'T ALLOWED IN LISMORE AND THAT'S WHERE THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN HAVEN'T BEEN KNOWN TO ANYBODY GANG EVEN SIGNAL STATION WAS GOING TO OPEN UP AND WE WERE GOING TO GO THERE WHICH MEANT VERY GREAT DIFFICULTY BECAUSE FROM THE STATION HOTEL TO GAVE IT WAS ABOUT COUPLE THREE MILES TWO OR THREE MILES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT THAT WAS NO JOKE EVENTUALLY I WAS THERE FOR A SIGNAL STATION FOR ABOUT I WOULD SAY ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE GANG OF THEM WAS OPENED GAVAN SIGNAL STATION WAS THEN OPENED UP FOR THE WRENS AND WE TOOK OVER FROM THE MEN WE HAD AN INTAKE THEN OF MORE VS WRENS SO THERE WERE NOW SIX OF US INSTEAD OF FOUR WE TOOK OVER GANEVAN FROM THE MEN VERY VERY SPARTAN WHEN WE WERE AT THE PIER SIGNAL STATION WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE MEALS WITH IN THE MESS PROPER MEALS AND WHEN WE WERE ON NIGHT WATCH THEY WOULD DO US UP NICE SANDWICHES WHEN WE MOVED FROM PER SIGNAL STATION TO THE GARVAN SIGNAL STATION WE WERE STATIONED AT A PLACE CALLED RACE LODGE WHICH WAS VERY TOUGH GOING THEY DIDN'T LIKE WATCH KEEPERS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T HANDLE US NEARLY ALL NEARLY ALL THE WRENNERY WAS WRITERS OPERATORS WHO WORKED PROPER WATCH HOURS THEY WORK NINE TO FIVE NOT US WE HAD YOU KNOW WE HAD TO DO IT WATCH KEEPING HOURS SAME AS THE NAVY IF YOU WERE LUCKY YOU GET A HOT DINNER IF YOU DIDN'T YOU JUST HAD A SARDINE SANDWICH THE FOOD WAS PRETTY SPARSE IF YOU READ IN THE BOOK PEOPLE AND MY FRIENDS WHO READ THE BOOK SAY WHY DID YOU STAND IT I SAID BUT THERE WAS A WAR AND WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY DIFFERENT WE HAD TO GO TO IT IT WAS OUR JOB THE MEN IT WAS IT WAS A VERY VERY SPARSE SIGNAL STATION YOU WANT ME TO DESCRIBE IT TO A THE SIGNAL STATION ITSELF WAS RIGHT ON THE TOP OF GANEVAN JUST BY DONNELLY HOUSE WHICH IS THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND LADY DOODLE I THINK THEY WERE CALLED MAC DOODLE IT WAS ON THEIR LAND AND IT HAD BEEN BUILT AS A LOOKOUT POST I THINK ORIGINALLY FOR THE COASTGUARDS IT WAS A VERY SPARSE TOTER PLACE YOU HAD TO REACH IT BUT TO GET TO IT IT WAS TO CLIMB UP A CLIFF SHEER CLIFF THE ROAD WENT BELOW US AND THE SHEER CLIFF UP WHICH WE HAD TO CARRY THE OLDEST LAMP BATTERIES WHICH WAS VERY HEAVY AND THEN WE HAD TO HAVE A COAL FIRE BECAUSE WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO BURN ANY CONFIDENTIAL BOOKS WHICH WE HAD IF ANY IF WE HAD ANY KIND OF AN INVASION WE HAD TO PUT BOOKS GOODNESS KNOWS HOW BECAUSE THEY WERE LEAD LINE THEY WERE SAFE BUT WHILE WE HAD THE WE HAD A BUNK DOWN BELOW THE TOP AND A BALCONY ALL ROUND WE HAD A BIG TEN INCH THREE AUDIS LAMPS AN ART AT ART SET IT WAS REALLY JUST GO THAT WAS IT JUST PUSHED INTO THE DEPEND HOW FAR COULD YOU SEE FROM THERE AND WHAT WAS YOUR WE COULD SEE LITERALLY WHERE SHE GOT IT WE COULD SEE RIGHT WE COULD SEE ME RIGHT THE WAY DOWN TO MULL OVER TO LISMORE WE HAD PERFECT VISION OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS COMING AND GOING WHY WAS THAT SUCH AN IMPORTANT STRETCH OF COASTLINE IN TERMS OF THE CONVOY ON BECAUSE IT WAS VERY SAFE UM THOUGHT THEY COULD COME IN IF YOU COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE MAP THERE WAS A COMPLETE BAY AND TOBERMORREY THE ESCORT SHIPS USUALLY ABOUT TWO OR THREE DESTROYERS WOULD DROP THE CONVOY OFF AND GO UP TO TOBERMORREY THEY WOULD GO UP SOUND OF MULL IF YOU COULD VISUALIZE THAT COASTLINE MULL ALMOST PROTECTS THE BAY ANY SHIPS PASSING HAVE TO GO ROUND BEHIND THE MALL THEY DON'T REALIZE COMING IN THAT'S ANOTHER STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK UM IT WAS A VERY SAFE HAVEN THEY CAME IN THEY WERE ESCORTED OFF FROM US PROBABLY DOWN TO IRRIGATE INTO THE CLYDE FOR UNLOADING OR THEY WOULD MASS UP READY TO GO OUT THERE WAS EITHER OF ARRIVAL OR AN EXPECTED TIME OF DISPATCH THEY WERE EITHER COMING OR GOING AND WHAT WAS THE MOST SHIPS YOU THINK YOU EVER SAW THEM I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE HARBOUR WOULD BE FULL I WOULD SAY MORE THAN THAT YES THIRTY MOST LIKELY AND OF COURSE YOU'D HAVE A LIST AND UNFORTUNATELY THEY MIGHT BE A STRAGGLER BUT THEY WEREN'T THEY NEVER CAME YOU THAT WAS THE TERRIBLE THING YOU THINK I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ONE WE HAD QUITE A LOT OF LOSSES UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN THE BAY COMING AND GOING YOU'D EXPECT TO SEE THE SHIP BECAUSE WE HAVE A LIST SENT TO US WHICH WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL LIST AN EXPECTED TIME OF ARRIVAL AND YOU'D GIVE THEM ABOUT TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT CAME YOU JUST WONDER WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WERE ALL MANNED BY MOSTLY MERCHANT MERCHANT MEN SO THEIR MORSE WASN'T VERY GOOD BUT NOW AND AGAIN YOU'D GET A SHIP WHICH HAD A FEW THE UNITED STATES WHEN AMERICA CAME IN IT WAS BETTER PLANNED THE LIBERTY SHIPS CAME THEN AND THEY WERE BETTER MANNED THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OVERPOWERING REALLY BECAUSE THEY WERE SO SHALL I SAY THIS OVER CLEVER USED TO SEND MORE AT THE RATE OF KNOTS THINKING THAT WE COULDN'T ANSWER IT WE WOULD SEND BACK AT THE SAME RATE THIS IS WHY WE DIDN'T LIKE THE AMERICANS VERY MUCH I'M AFRAID THEY TRIED ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY TRIED TO COME UP TO OUR SIGNAL STATION WE COULDN'T HAVE THEM IN WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM IN WE HAD ONE OR TWO PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE COMING UP SHALL I GO ON ONE NIGHT FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE THING AND A KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND I THOUGHT THIS VOICE I DIDN'T WANT KNOW WHO IT WAS IT WAS A MAN'S VOICE WE ALREADY HAD A WREN MURDERED IN VERRE OR VS WREN MURDERED IN RARE ON NIGHT WATCH SO WE WERE ALL VERY WARM WHICH IT WE ALL WERE TAUGHT HOW TO HANDLE A PISTOL WE HAD TO GO ON THE RANGE WHICH WAS THE RF HAD A RANGE AND WE WERE TAKEN ON TO THE RANGE BY AN INSTRUCTOR AND TAUGHT TO FIRE PISTOL AND A VERY SMALL RISK AND I WAS TAUGHT TO FIRE HOLDING MY WRIST SO I COULD FIRE IN MY WRIST WE ALSO HAD A RIFLE UP IN THE SIGNAL STATION IT WASN'T LOADED THERE WAS NO AMMUNITION IN IT BUT THE PISTOLS WERE AT THIS RIFLE WASN'T LOADED IT WAS JUST THERE AS A WARNING I HEARD THESE FOOTSTEPS AND THIS IS PERFECTLY TRUE I HEARD THESE FOOTSTEPS COMING UP AND I SAID TO MY POT I DON'T LIKE THIS VERY MUCH SO THIS KEPT KNOCKING ON THE DOOR IN THE CAUGHT THIS RIFLE AND I THOUGHT NOW I CAN'T I KNEW IT WAS UNLOADED AND I THOUGHT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO SO I PUSHED IT UP THE OTHER WAY AND AS THIS VOICE CAME THROUGH THE THING I LIFTED IT UP AND I WAS GOING TO CLONE HIM ON THE HEAD WITH IT HE SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT JOAN IT'S ONLY ME AND IT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNAL MEN FROM DOWN BELOW STUPID WHO'D GOT A DATE I HAD CHANGED WATCHES WITH A GIRL I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO TELL HER THIS REALLY OBVIOUSLY USED TO COME UP FOR A CUP OF TEA AT THIS TIME AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH HER HE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON WATCH AND HE NEARLY GOT HIMSELF KILLED AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN I WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE IN MY RIGHTS NOBODY GOT A GREAT BIG PROHIBITED NUANCE UP ON THE DOOR BUT NEVER EVER CAME TO ANYTHING AND I NEVER EVER REPORTED IT BECAUSE WHEN I GOT HIM INTO TERRIBLE TROUBLE BUT WE WERE ARMED ONLY WITH A PISTOL A RIFLE WITH NO AMMUNITION BECAUSE WE HAD IN VERRE WHAT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T KNOW I'M AFRAID ALL THAT IS A NEED TO KNOW TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WE WERE JUST TOLD TO BE VERY AWARE AND TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS I THINK STEPNEY MENTIONS THIS IN HER BOOK AS WELL WE NEVER EVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED HAD WE THOUGHT WAS A SPY A MAN USED TO COME DOWN IT WAS ALL PROHIBITED LAND FOR CIVILIANS BUT THIS MAN USED TO COME DOWN SIT ON THE ROCKS WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS AND HE HAD BARNACLES AND A CAMERA WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CONVOYS WE COULD TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AROUND THE ONE THING BUT NOT A CONVOY NOT ALLOWED TO SO WE REPORTED THIS MAN TO OUR HEADQUARTERS SIGNAL BACK IN THE STATION HOTEL NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ABOUT IT HE JUST DISAPPEARED WE NEVER EVER HEARD WHETHER HE WAS JUST A LOCAL NEWSPAPER MAN OR WHETHER HE WAS A KIND OF A SPY OR WHETHER HE WAS JUST INTERESTED IN SHIPS WE NEVER HEARD I'M AFRAID IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS A NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD JUST PICKING UP ON THE AMERICANS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT STORY BECAUSE THE AMERICANS GAVE YOU SOME HAS OR YES WELL THEY WOULD TRYING TO BRIBE US THEY WANTED TO COME UP THE SIGNAL STATION LOOK OUT LOOK HONEY WE'VE GOT SOME NYLONS HONEY WE'VE GOT BANANAS ON BOARD SO STUPID AND SO CHILDISH WE TOOK A DISLIKE TO THEM WHAT WE DIDN'T LIKE WAS THE WAY THEY USED TO TREAT THEIR OFFICERS COMPLETE DISRESPECT THEY WOULD CALL THEM BY THEIR FIRST NAMES WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS TERRIBLE THE CAPTAINS AND ALL THE AND THEIR OFFICERS NEVER SEEMED TO TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THEM WE WERE IN BURN ONE DAY SHOPPING AND THE AMERICANS CAME ON BOARD CAME OBVIOUSLY SHOPPING AS WELL WE HAD TO TAKE US FOR A CUP OF COFFEE OK FINE WHICH THEY DID WE TOOK THEM TO THE MC AND WE HAD A CUP OF COFFEE GOING BACK SOME OF THEIR OFFICERS WERE COMING THE OTHER WAY WE WERE APPALLED THE WAY THEY SPOKE NO SALUTING HIGH HIGH AT THIS IS TERRIBLE I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT THEY WERE JUST ANOTHER WORLD AWAY AND THEY WERE TRYING TO BRIBE US WITH BANANAS AND NYLONS AND WE DIDN'T PUT ON TREE WE THOUGHT IT WAS SO CHILDISH WITH ALL THIS VERY FAST FLASHING MORSE YOU TOUCHED ON THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF COMMUNICATION YOU HAD THE SAME FOR YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LAMPS THERE ALL WHEN DID YOU USE DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMUNICATION IS ONE SPECIFIC TYPE IN THE STATION ALWAYS BY MORE BY LIGHT SOMETIMES BY RT NEARLY ALWAYS THE ART WE REALLY ONLY USED FOR THE ASIC STATION LAMP MOSTLY THE OLDEST ALL THE BIG TEN INCH WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT OF COURSE TO HANDLE YOU HAD TO GO OUT ON THE OF COURSE UP THERE THE WINDS WERE ALWAYS AT GALE FORCE AND WE ALWAYS HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOR FOR THE WEATHER EVERY DAY WE HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOR THE CONVOYS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER WAS WHAT WERE THE CONES THE CONES WERE THE CONE WAS A SHAPE LIKE THAT AND YOU HOISTED IT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHICH WAY NOW UP UPWARDS FOR THE NORTH WIND AND DOWN FOR THE SOUTH WIND VERY PRIMITIVE BUT IT GAVE THEM SOME IDEA OF THE WAY THE WIND ANOTHER THING YOU COULD TELL THE WAY THE WIND WAS BLOWING JUST LOOK AT THE SIN WHICH WE ALWAYS HAD TO FLY THE WHITE SIN AND WE HAD TO ABIDE BY THE COLOURS OF THE WHITE NINE PUT IT UP AT SUNRISE AND DOWN AT SUNSET THE SIN WAS ALWAYS FLYING SO YOU COULD ALWAYS TELL WHICH WAY THE WIND WAS BLOWING WITHOUT THE ONE BUT IT WAS A GALE FORCE WIND PUT THE CONE UP WHICH SOMETIMES MEANT THE COME WAS UP FOR DAYS BECAUSE THE GALES WOULD BLOW UP THERE WINDY AND SOMETIMES WE WOULD HAVE TO BE LASHED ON TO THE TEN INCH BY OUR OP BECAUSE IT WAS SO WINDY YOU KEPT BEING BLOWN AWAY IT WAS VERY VERY COLD VERY WE WERE ALWAYS WET BUT WE DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER A BATH OR A SHOWER UP THERE WHEN WE WENT BACK HOW LONG WOULD YOU BE SITUATED UP THERE WELL THE NIGHT WATCH WAS A LONG ONE WE'D GO ON SOMETHING LIKE EIGHT O'CLOCK AND COME OFF AT EIGHT O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING THAT WAS A VERY LONG ONE THE OTHER WATCHES PRETTY WELL FOUR HOURS ON A FOUR HOURS OFF BUT THE NIGHT WATCH IT WAS A TOUGH ONE AND YOU HAD TO WALK THERE AND BACK FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO WALK WE COULD BE OBJECTED BECAUSE THE MAN IN THE STICK STATION DOWN BELOW US GOT TRANSPORT THE SAME WATCHES OH WELL YES THEN THEY DECIDED THEY WOULD ISSUE US WITH BICYCLES WHICH THEY DID WE HAD A WREN OFFICER CAME UP TO SEE US AND HE SAID THIS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH AND THEN THEY SUPPLIED TRANSPORT FOR US SO WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK THE NIGHT WATCH BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS THREE OR FOUR MILES IN THE PITCH DARK ALONG ALL THE COAST ROAD BUT FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO BEFORE THEY REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING THAT'S AMAZING ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK YOU HEAR THAT THE DUKE OF YORK WE NEVER HAD THE VERY BIG SHIPS THE BIGGEST ESCORT SHIP THAT EVER REALLY CAME INTO US WERE DESTROYERS OR CORVETTES BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS USED TO GO INTO MALL TO WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS TO GO BACK OUT SO WE NEVER REALLY HAD ANYTHING WHAT I WOULD CALL VERY LARGE I WAS ON WATCH WITH STEPNEY ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION IF YOU CAN PICTURE ISLANDS AND THE SEA AND SUDDENLY YOU SEE A GREAT BIG CROSS ANCHOR CROSS MASK COMING ACTUALLY THINKING WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE WE HAD NO T FOR ANYTHING WE HAD NOTHING WHATEVER THING IT WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT WE CALLED IT UP NO REPLY COURSE THAT WAS WORRYING NO REPLY BECAUSE IT WAS A SPECIAL EVERY HOUR IT CHANGED CALL UP SIGN CHANGED ON THE CODE BOOK YOU WOULD CALL THEM UP BY THE CODE WHICH FOR THE DAY NO REPLY WE HAD A LITTLE SHIP WE HAD TWO SHIPS ACTUALLY ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN STAR ONE WAS CALLED THE SOUTHERN WAVE AND THEY WERE PATROL SHIPS WHICH USED TO PATROL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AMONG THE CONVOYS ALL THE TIME THEY WERE OLD WHAT I WOULD CALL SOMETHING LIKE A CORVETTE I THINK THEY WERE OLD TRAWLERS THEY WERE MANNED BY NAVY THEY WERE IF ANY TROUBLE WE CALLED THEM UP IMMEDIATELY AND WHEN WE CALLED UP THE SOUTHERN STAR SHE WAS WAY OUT OVER A MILE AND ASKED HER WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT SHE SAID I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING FROM HERE BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE IN A WAY WAY BUT I'LL GO AND INVESTIGATE SHE SAID IF IT'S ANYTHING TROUBLE I'LL PUT A SHOT ACROSS ITS BOWS THAT ANYWAY THIS THING GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER EVENTUALLY I MANAGED TO CALL UP OBVIOUSLY THE BUNTING TOSSER THAT'S WHAT VISUAL SIGNALS ARE CALLED BUNTING TOSSER WAS ASLEEP I SHOULD THINK HE THOUGHT WERE ONLY CARUISING AROUND THESE ISLANDS AND HE CAME BACK QUICKLY WITH WHY INSTEAD OF PEAT NUMBER BECAUSE ALL SHIPS HAVE PANIC NUMBERS EITHER THE PENNANT NUMBER OF THE SHIP OR THE COD WE CAME BACK WITH NOTHING QUICKLY AND I SAID TO STEFAN DUKE OF YORK IT'S A BATTLESHIP I SAID BASE DON'T KNOW SO WE QUICKLY PHONED OUR BASE AND THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE US BECAUSE NOBODY HAD GOT ON T ANYWAY THE CAPTAIN OF OUR CAPTAIN BASE CAME RUSHING DOWN TOOK HIM ABOUT HALF AN HOUR TO GET TO US BY WHICH TIME SHE WAS IN FULL VIEW MASSIVE IT JUST FILLED UP THE WHOLE OF THE BAY I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT AND OF COURSE IT WAS A GREAT BIG HA ABOUT THIS WHY DIDN'T WE KNOW OF COURSE SHE WAS SHE WAS ON PILGRIMAGE UP TO NORWAY AFTER THE MSHANHORST SHE WAS DOING THIS TO I SUPPOSE SHE THOUGHT OH WE'VE GOT TIME TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY DID IT THEY WERE WAY OFF COURSE NOTHING SHE MUST HAVE KNOWN THE VERY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS VERY DANGEROUS OUT THERE BUT SHE DID SHE CAME RIGHT PAST US SAILING JUST OFF MULL I MEAN I COULD SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHERE SHE WAS WELL THAN THAT SHE JUST APPEARED BEHIND THE ISLANDS AS IF IT WAS ON SOME KIND OF A FILM IT WAS INCREDIBLE AND IT WAS SORT OF THING YOU DREAM ABOUT LOVELY STORY LOVELY STORY NOBODY EVER REALLY AGAIN TO KNOW WE NEVER EVER REALLY FOUND OUT BUT WE REALIZED AFTERWARDS WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT WE WERE ON OUR WAY UP TO THE BATTLE IN NORWAY DRINK OF TEA PLEASE DAY OH YES WHEN D DAY CAME WE HAD ALL THE SHIPS WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY LOOKED SO DREADFUL THEY WERE ALL SORT OF BATTERED SHIPS WE THOUGHT WE HAD SEEN SOME AWFUL SIGHTS THERE WERE ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY OF THEM I SHOULD THINK WITH TWO DESTROYERS DURBAN AND SOMETHING ELSE HE WAS THE DURBAN MAYBE I'VE WRITTEN MAYBE SHE MENTIONED THEM IN THE BOOK ANYWAY AND WE THOUGHT GOSH DESTROYER DOESN'T IT WAS A TERRIBLE STATE SURELY THE NAVY KNOW WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THEY WERE THEY CAME IN I SUPPOSE THEY WERE IN ABOUT A WEEK OR MORE THAN THAT TEN DAYS ENOUGH TIME FOR STEPHANIE TO GET TO KNOW THIS SIGNAL MAN THEY SAID IT MUST BE TEN DAYS WE STILL COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WERE IN SUCH A AND WHY THEY DID BECAUSE THEY ONLY EVER STAYED FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS BUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A LONG TIME AND WE THOUGHT LOW SOMETHING SOMETHING'S GOING ON THEN ALL WE WERE TOLD WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO POST ANY MORE LETTERS ALL OUR LETTERS WERE TO BE CANCELED ALL OUR POSTAGE OUT WAS TO BE CANCELLED EVERYTHING GOING OUT FROM THE BASE WAS TO BE STOPPED AND WE ALL LEAVE WAS STOPPED AND WE THOUGHT SOMETHING'S IN THE AIR YOU GET THAT FEELING WE THOUGHT WHERE ARE THEY GOING WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO OF COURSE THEY WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS M NIGHT BEFORE DAY THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT OR SO THEY SAID THE NIGHT BEFORE ALL SEEMED TO BE GETTING READY AND THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG SHIP CAME ALONGSIDE SOME OF THEM AND TOOK OFF A LOT OF STUFF AND WE THOUGHT THEY DON'T USUALLY UNLOAD HERE IT GOES TO GOUROCK AND GREENOCK WHERE THEY WERE UNLOADING ALL SORTS OF STUFF AND WE WATCHED THEM THROUGH THE TELESCOPE CHAIRS AND TABLES AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS WERE COMING UP WE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS NEXT DAY WHEN WE CAME UP ON WATCH THEY WERE ALL BUSY GETTING READY TO GO OUT AND WE HAD NO EXPECTED TIME OF DEPARTURE AT ALL THEY ALL JUST SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR PATROL SHIPS HAD NO IDEA THEY SAID WHAT DO WE DO WHEN THEY'RE GOING WHAT WE HAD WE COULDN'T TELL THEM OF COURSE IT WAS SO SECRET AND THAT'S THE END OF THE DAY THAT WAS ALL THE BLOCK SHIPS GOING DOWN THEY WERE ROTTEN OLD SHIPS THAT NOBODY WANTED THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD BEEN SO BATTLE SCARRED THAT THEY WERE ALMOST UNTHINKABLE SO THEY WERE THE TWO BIG BLOCK SHIPS AND THESE WERE SENT DOWN TO HELP OUT WE NEVER EVER HEARD UNTIL THE END OF THE WAR WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT THEE OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE THE BLOCK SHIPS THING YOU TOUCHED ON EARLIER BUT I'D LIKE MORE CLARIFICATION ON THE CONVOYS ESSENTIALLY YOU DID TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTATION CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN AGAIN FOR ME YOU KNOW HOW PROCESS A DISPATCH RIDER WOULD ARRIVE FROM BASE FOR THE STATION HOTEL WHICH IS THEIR BASE STATCHBRIDER WOULD ARRIVE WITH A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH WOULD CONTAIN OF THE NEXT CONVOY COMING IN AND RIGHT SO YOU THEN GET IT OUT PUT IT IN FRONT OF YOU PUT IT UP AND WAIT FOR THE FIRST ONE LITERALLY TO COME IN AT NINE HUNDRED PERHAPS THEY WOULD START TO COME INTO NINE THREE HUNDRED THEY'D OBVIOUSLY BEEN POSE I THINK FROM IRELAND THEY WERE THEN SORT OF MARKED ACROSS THEY WOULD GET THE OF THEM COMING ACROSS THAT WAS LITERALLY HOW WE GOT THE T FROM A DISPATCH RIDER CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WOULD COME I SUPPOSE THEY ARE ABOUT THE CONVOYS WERE COMING IN QUITE REGULARLY ONCE A MONTH COMING IN BY THE TIME THEY'D GONE OUT AGAIN THE BAY WAS ALWAYS REALLY KNOW ALWAYS CHOCKABLOCK OF COURSE YOU GOT THE BOATS GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WITH SUNDERLAND AND CATALINA IT WAS QUITE A BUSY LITTLE HARBOUR AND EVERY SINGLE THING HAD TO BE LOGGED AND LOGGED OUT IDENTIFIED AND PUT DOWN YOU HAD TO BE ON WATCH PRETTY WELL AWARE WHAT WAS GOING ON ALL AROUND YOU LITERALLY IN THE AIR WITH THE CATALINA THIS IS WHY WE HAD TO HAVE SOUTHERN WAVE AND SOUTHERN STAR WHO USED TO BE OUT THEY WERE ALSO SIGNALLING AND TRYING TO GET THEM IT WAS REALLY LIKE A GREAT BIG HERD OF SHEEP AND TWO SHEPHERDS TRYING TO CREPT THEM IN IT COULD HAVE BEEN ORGANISED CHAOS BUT IT WASN'T IT WAS VERY GOOD ALWAYS WORKED IT WAS JUST REALLY SHEPHERDING THESE SHIPS THESE BIG LIBERTY SHIPS THEY WERE QUITE BIG DID EACH LIBERTY SHIP HAVE ITS OWN SORT OF COOL SIGN THAT YOU WOULD YES WE KNEW WE KNEW EACH ONE WE HAD AN IDENTIFICATION FOR EACH ONE SO WE COULD MARK THEM OFF IF NOT WE GOT THERE EVERYONE'S NAME SOME WERE VERY LONG BUT YES WE HAD AN IDENTIFICATION ALL OF THEM YOU HAD TO CONCENTRATE QUITE HARD WHEN THEY WERE COMING IN YOU COULDN'T LET TENSION AND BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO BE SO QUICK ABOUT SOME OF THEM NOT COMING IN HOW DID HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU'VE DONE FIVE CONVOYS AND MISSING TWENTY BOATS WHAT WAS THE FEELING WELL FIRST OF ALL WELL IT FIRST HAPPENED YOU WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE I HOPE THEY'RE ALL RIGHT BUT BY THE TIME YOU'VE DONE IT FOR ABOUT A YEAR OR SO YOU JUST ACCEPT THAT WHAT DO YOU DO YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED YOU NEED TO KNOW WE USED TO TRY AND FIND OUT WE WERE NEVER EVER TOLD THREE OF THE PROBABLY BEEN SUNK OFF SOMEWHERE I WONDER HOW FAR THEY GOT AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MEN AND WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THAT LOVELY STUFF THAT WAS COMING IN OR GOING OUT I DON'T YOU JUST DIDN'T KNOW YOU JUST NEVER KNEW YOU JUST HAD TO ACCEPT WHATEVER WAS HAPPENING AND LEAVE IT PUT ALL YOUR SORT OF PERSONAL FEELINGS ASIDE BECAUSE IT WAS NO GOOD WORRYING ABOUT IT BECAUSE WHAT COULD YOU DO WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF D DAY DAY AT THE END OF THE WAR STILL ON WATCH DAY DON'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE'RE UP IN SCOTLAND WE WERE INVITED TO A BIG PARADE IN EDINBURGH WHICH WE DID TAKE PART IN LATER ON BUT A BIG PARADE WE THOUGHT WITH THE TIME WE GET THERE IS A JOURNEY FROM OBAN TO EDINBURGH YOU JUST DON'T GET ON YOUR BIKE AND GO YOU I DON'T REMEMBER OR WE JUST HAD A PARTY WE HAD A PARTY I THINK WE WERE ALL WERE NEVER ALLOWED OBVIOUSLY TO HAVE THE RUM THE RUM RATION SOMETIMES WE USED TO GO THE SHIPS WOULD COME IN AND WE USED TO GET A LITTLE TOT OF RUM BUT I HATE IT IT I DIDN'T LIKE IT VERY MUCH BECAUSE AFTER THE WAR I WAS IN THE ROYAL NAVAL ASSOCIATION FOR A FACT UP HERE AND I WAS VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE BRANCH OF THE ROYAL NAVAL ASSOCIATION AND WITH TOTS UP THERE ALWAYS OFFERED ME I DON'T LIKE IT IT WAS TOO HOT AND TOO FIERY FOR ME SO V DAY REALLY JUST WITH A TOSS OF RUM AND A KNEES UP IN THE BASE AND V J DAY THE END OF THE WATER THE END OF THE WAR WHERE WAS I AT THE END OF THE WAR I WAS AT TOWARD POINT IN NON BECAUSE I WAS AS THE CONVOYS WERE NO LONGER NEEDED WE WERE NO LONGER NEEDED STEPNEY WENT TO IRELAND I WENT TO TOWARD POINT NON TO HMS BRONTOSAS AND THAT WAS A SHIPS COMING BACK AND FORWARD DOWN THE CLYDE AND THAT WAS WHERE I SPENT A DAY THERE AGAIN AND JUST ANOTHER KNEES UP REALLY YOU CAN'T DO MUCH MORE ABOUT IT FROM THERE I WAS I COULD EITHER STAY IN THE WRENS OR I COULD BE A BIT MOB FROM THERE WHICH I WAS BECAUSE I WANTED TO GO ON A SOCIAL SERVICES COURSE SO I'D ALREADY CLIMBED UP WHAT I WANTED TO DO IN A WAY I REGRET NOW NOT STAYING IN I THINK IN A WAY BUT AS IT HAPPENED IT DIDN'T WORK OUT LIKE THAT REFLECT ON IT ALL ON THE FORTY YEARS I ENJOYED IT I QUITE LIKED IT I'M GLAD I DID IT IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE OF COURSE I NEVER HAVE AGAIN NOBODY WILL EVER HAVE AGAIN BECAUSE IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN LIKE THAT AGAIN I ENJOYED MY TIME UP THERE I LOVED THE HIGHLANDS
