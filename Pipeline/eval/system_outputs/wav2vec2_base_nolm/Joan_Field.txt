DIDN'T MEAN TO BE OFF PUTTING BUT THEY WERE WIN COTE IT IS AN INSOLENT LAND UP IN THE HIGHLANDS I DON'T KNOW WHITHERYU KNOW THE HIGHNASS VERY WELL HEM THERE ARE A THING AND TO THEMSELVES EWELL SUGGEST ME IF EVERTHEN JUST DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ABOUT WAT WAT THE FACE WAS THI WA WELL YOU SURROUND AS TY WAYS THAT I IT IS IT THIS OPENNESS OPENY AND WEL WILL TALK ABOUT THE WORK YES WELL I OPEN FIRST OF ALL AN IR STATION YOU KNEW WHAT WAS CALLED THE STATION HOTEL AND THE SIGNAL STATION ON THE PIER WAS ONLY A SHORT WALK AWAY AND I MET UP WITH THE GIRL WHO WAS GOING TO WORK WITH ME SHE'D BEEN THERE ABOUT A WEEK WE HADN'T YET STARTED REALLY GETTING THE CONVOYS IN SO WE WERE TOLD WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN THAT TOM THE CONVOYS WOULD COME IN IN THEIR BEING ABAY AND WE'VE HAD TO MANLY MANTHE MAN ALL THE TIME AND WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO GO ON ANY BOATS ANTHAT'S ANOTHER ATTHE STORY AN WE AM HAD TO MONTMONATOR EVERYTHING COMING IN AND OUT WE ALSO HAD TO LOOK AFTER FUNNY ENOUGH HE A MARY F HAD THEIR THRUNDERLANDS AND CATALINAS UP THERE AND AM THEY HAD A CALL SIGN WHICH CHANGED EVERY HOUR AND HALF OF THEM COULD NEVER EVER READ IT SO WE USED TO HAVE THO READ THEIR COA SIGNAL FOR THEM TO SEND THEIR PATROL BELL TO HELPBUT THAT WAS BUT UNBEKNOWN TO O BASE WHO NEVER I HAD CLUW WHAT WAS GOING ON IT WAS A CRAZY SET UP REALLY AND TO THE SUBMARINES ON PATROL DUTY USED TO COME IN ALONGSIDE THE PEER WE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THEM THEIR SIGNALS AND THEY WERE THN WENT OUT ON PATROL THAT WAS MOSTLY WHAT WE WERE DOING IN THE PEER SIGNAL STATION AND BUT THIS WASN'T ADEQUATE ENOUGH AND GANAVAN SIGNAL STATION WHICH WAS RIGHT ROUND THE CORNER FROM WHERE WE WERE WAS STILL MANNED BY THE MEN ND THEY ALSO HAD A NEW ASDIC SENTOF OPENING UP JUST BELOW IWISH WE RADAR ANALSTIC AND THEY LET WER STILL DONE BY THE MEN AND THE MEN WERE GOING FROM GANOVAN AND THEY WERE GOING OVER TO LISMAR THE RENS WENT ALOUD OUT THERE BECAUSE IT WAS NOIT WAS COMPLETELY ALONE AT THEU NO NO IRE WAS NO INHABITATION OR SAY TO FEWFOR FEW SHEEP FARMERS SO WILLIAM RENS WENT ALOUD OUT IN ISMAL AND THAT'S WHERE THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN AN BE KNOWN TO ANYBODY AND SO THE GANAVAN SIGNAL STATION WAS GOING TO OPEN NOW AND WE WERE GOING TO GO THERE WHICH MADE VERY GREAT DIFFICULTY BECAUSE FROM THE STATION HOTEL TO GANABON IT WAS ABOUT COUPLE OF THREE MILES TWO OR THREE MILES IN THE MIDDLE OF A NIGHT THAT'S NO OAK AND SO VENTUALLY WE WAS THERE FOR ABOUT PEER SIGNAL STATION FOR ABOUT I WOULD SAY ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE GANABAN WAS OPEN GANABON SIGNAL STATION WAS THEN OPENED UP FOR THE RENS AND WE TOOK OVER FROM THE MEN IME KNOW WE HAD AN INTAKE THEN OF MORE VIERS REND SO HE NOW SIX OF US INSTEAD OF FOUR AND WE TOOK OVER GANOVAN FROM THE MEN VERY VERY SPARTAN WHEN WE WERE AT THE PEER SIGNAL STATION WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE MEALS WITH INA MESS PROPER MEALS AND N WEN ONE NIGHT WATCH IF WOED DO US UP NIGHE SANDWICHES WHEN WE MOVED FROM PEER SIGNAL STATION TO THE GANOVAN SIGNAL STATION WE WERE STATIONED AT A PLACE CALLED RASSY LODGE WHICH WAS VERY TOUGH GOING AND THEY DON'T LIKE WATCH KEEPERS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T HANDLE US THEY NEARLY ALL NEARLY WHOLE OF THE AND RENORY WAS WRITERS OR W TEA OPERATORS WHO WORKED PROPER WATCH OUT THEY WERAT NINE TILL FIVE NOT AS WE HAD OUKNOW WE HAD TO DO AT WATCH KEEPING HOURS THE SAME AS THE NAVY SO WWE IF YOU WERE LUCKY YOU GET A HOT DINNER IF YOU DIDN'T YOU JUST HAD A SARDY IN SANDWICH SO TOU FOOD WAS PRETTY SPARTH IF YOU READ IN THE BOOK PEOPLE MY FRIENDS WHO READ THE BOOK SAY WHY DID YOU STAND IT BUT I SAID BUT THAT THE WARROM WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY DIFFERENT WE HAD TO GO DO IT WITH OUR JOB THE MEN IT WAS IT WAS A VERY VERY SPAR SIGNAL STATION AND AND WI SHALL WE WANT ME TO DESCRIBE IT TO ISI THE SIGNAL STATION ITSELF WAS RIGHT ON THE TOP OF EGANAVAN ON JUST BY DONNOLE DONOLI HOUSE WHICH IS THE HOUSE OF THE AMLORD LADY OF MO DODLE I THINK THEY WERE CORD YES MY DOL AND IT WAS ON THEIR LAND AND IT HAD BEEN BUILT AS A LOOK OUT POST I THINK ORIGINALLY FOR THE COAST GUARDS IT WAS A VERY SPARS THERE WAS TO A TUTER PLACE YOU HAD TO REACH IT BUT TO CET TO IT IT WAS A CLIMB UP A CLIFF ALMOST A SHEER CLIFF THE ROAD WENT BELOW US AND THE SHEER CLIFF UP WHICH WE HAD TO CARRY THE OLDEST LAMP BATCHERIES WHICH WER VERY HEAVY AND THEN AN WE HAD TO HAVE A FA COAL FIRE AY BECAUSE WE HAD TO BE ABLE TO BURN ANY CONFIDENTIAL BOOKS WHICH WE HAD IF ANYTHING IF WE HAD ANY KIND OF AN INVASION AND WE HAD TO PUT BOOKS AT GOODNESKNOWS HOW BECAUSE THEY WERE LED IN IN THEY WERE SAFEFR BUT WE THAT'S WHILE WE HAD THE FAR AND WE HAD A BANK DOWN BELOW AND THE SIGNAL UP THE TOP AND IT WOULD BE BULCONY ALL ROUND WE HAD A BIG TEN INCH AS THREE OLDEST LAMPS AND EAN ARTY SA ARTY SET AND E WAS REALLY JUST GO YOU KNOW THAT PASTHEIT WE WE JUST PUSHED INTO THE DEPEN AN HOW FAR COULD YOU SEE FROM THER WHAT WAS YOUR TE ONT COULD SEE WITHAT LITTERY WHERE SHES GOT IT WE COULD SEE RI WE COULD SEE MAL RIGHT THE WAY DOWN TO MOL OVER TO LISMALL BUT WE HAD PERFECT VISION EM OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS COMING AND GOING WHY WAS THAT SUCH IMPORTANCE STRETCH A COASTINE IN SERVS OF THE CONVOYS YOULL BE BECAUSE AND IT WAS VERY SAFE AND THEY THOUGHT AN THEY COULD COME IN IT WAS IF YOU COULD HAVE A LOOK AT A MAP AND IS A COMPLETE BAY AND TOBER MORRY THE ESCORT SHIPS URMURED TO USUALLY PAPTUOUSLY DISTROYERS WOULD DROT TE CONVOY OFF AND GO UP TO TOBER MORRY AND THEY WOULD GO UP TO UP THE SOUND OF MUL AND IF YOU COAL VISUALIZE THAT COAST LINE MUL ALMOST PROTECTS THE BAY SO THERE ANY SHIPS PASSING HAVE TO GO ROUND BEHIND THE MULL THEY DON'T REALIZE YOU KNOW THE'SE COMING IN LES ANOW THE STORY ABOUT THE DUKE OF YORK AND I THINK IT WAS A VERY SAFE HAVEN AND THE THEY CAME IN AND THEY WERE ESCORTED OFF FROM US PROBABLY DOWN TO AMGORIX IG INTO THE CRIDE FOR A LOADING OR THEY WOULD MASS UP READY TO GO OUT WITH EITHER AN EXPECT A EIT A OF ARRIVAL OR AN EXPECTED TIME OF DESPATCH THEY WERE EITHER COMING OR GOING AN AS THE MOST OTHING EVER SAW THEM I DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE HARBOUR WOULD BE FULL I WOULD SAY THIRTY ALL THAT YIS THIRTY MOST LIKELY AND OF COURSE YOU'D HAD HAVE A LIST AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW YOU THINK OR THEY MIGHT BE A STRAGGLER BUT THEY WEREN'T NEVER CATE MEREDO THAT WAS THE TERRIBLE THING YOU THINK WHEN ONDER HAPPENED TO THAT ONE AND WE HAD QUITE A LOT OF LOSSES UNFORTUNATELY NOT IN E NOT IN THE BAY BUT YOU KNOW COMING IN GOING YOEXPECT TO SEIS CAUSE WE HAVE IT WE'D HAVE A LIST CENT TO US WHICH WAS THE CONFIDENTIAL LIST AN EXPECTED TIME OF ARRIVAL AND YOU'D GIVE THEM ABOUT TWO OR THREE HOURS BUT I NEVER CAME OU KNOWIN YOU JUST WONDER WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY WERE ALL MANNED BY A MOSTY MERCHANT MERCHANTMEN SO THEIR MORSEL ASN'T VERY GOOD BUT NOW AND AGAIN YOU'D GET A A SHIP WHICH HAD A FEW NA EXA THE UNITED STATES WHEN WHEN AMERICA CAME IN IT WAS BETTER PLANNED YOU KNOW THE LIBERTYSHIPS CAME THEN AND THEY THEY WERE BETTER BETTE A BETTER MANNED F THEY WERE EM A LITTLE BE OVERPOWERING RERELY BECAUSE IT WAS SO SHALL I SAY THIS OVER CLEVER THEY USED TO SEND MORSE AT THE RATE OF NOT THINKING THAT WE COULDN'T ANSWER IT WE WOULD SEND BACK AT THE SAME RATE AND MISSUS ROBBI DIDN'T LIKE THE AMERICANS VERY ICH I'M AFRAID AND THEY TRIED ALL SORTS OF THINGS THEY TRIED TO COME UP UUP UP TO OUR SIGNAL STATION D E WE COULDN'T HAVE THEM IN WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE THEM IN WE HAD ONE OR TWO PROBLEMS WITH PEOPLE COMING UP AND ONE SHALL I GO ON ONE NIGHT AND I COULD HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING OUT THE THING IN A KNOCK ON A DOOR AND I THOUGHT IN THIS VOICE I DIDN'T UNDER WHO IT WAS OF THE MAN'S VOICE WE ALREADY HAD A MET A REN MURDERED AT INVERARI A VIS REN MURDERED AT INVERARI ON NIGHT WATCH SO WE WERE ALL VERY WAR BY WHICH INT ON INTERSPECT WE ALL WERE TAUHT HOW TO HANDLE A PISTOL WE HAD TO GO ON THE RANGE WHICH WAS A THE R F HAD A RANGE AND WE WERE TAKEN ON TO THE RANGE BY INSTRUCTOR AND TAUGHT TO FIRE A PISTOL AND I HAN VERY SMALL WRISTS AND I WAS TORCH O FIRE HOLDING MY WRIST SO I COULD FIRE ITH MY WRIST WE ALSO HAD A RIFLE OF UPANNY SIGNAL STATION IT WASN'T LOWTED NO AMMUNITION IN IT BUT THE PISTOLS WERE'T BUT THIS RIFLE WASN'T LOADED IT WAS JUST THERE AS AS A WARNING I HEARD HIS FOOTS AND THIS IS PERFECTLY TRUE WEI HEARD HIS FOOTSTEPS COMING UP AND I SAID TO MY OPPO I DON'T LIKE THIS VERY MUCH SO THIS BLOY KEPT KNACKING ON THE DOOR IN THE END I I CUT THIS RIFLE I THOUGHT NY CONC I KNEW AS UNLOODED AND I THOUGHT NO ONE OT GOING TO DO SO PUNDIT UP THE OTHER WAY AND AS THIS BOICE CAME THROUGH THE THING AND LIFTED UP AND SCOT A CLONK HIM ON THE HEAD WITH IT HE SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT SOWN IT'S ONLY ME AND IT WAS ONE OF THE SIGNALMEN FROM DOWN BELOW STUPID WHO'D GOT A DATE I HAD CHANGED WATCHES WITH THE GIRL SI SHOULDN'T TELL TELL OF THIS REALLY HE OVASY USED TO COME UP FOR A CUP OF TEA AT THIS TIME AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH HER HE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON WATCH AND HE NEARLY GOT HIMSELF KILLED AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE BEEN QUIRE IN MY RIGHTS BECAUSE WHEN NOBODY GOT A GREAT BIG PROHIBITED NOTIONSE UT OF THE MODORVA I KNOWING NEVER EVER CAME TO ANYTHING AND I NEVER EVER REPORTED IT BECAUSE WHEN I GOT HIM INTO TERRIBLE TROUBLE BUT WE WERE ARMED BUT ONLY WITH A PISTOL AND AT A RIFLE WITH NO AMMUNITION BECAUSE WE' HAD A AREN IN INVERARI WAAS A CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T KNOW I'M AFRAID ALL THAT IS A NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD WHAT HAPPENED WE WERE JUST TOLD TO BE VERY AWARE AND O'LL TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS AND I THINK MENTSTEPHNE MENTIONS THIS IN OUR BOOK AS WELL WE NEVER EVER KNEW WHAT HAPPENED AND WHEN WE HAD WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A SPY OR A MAN USED TO COME DOWN IT WAS ALL PROHIBITED LAND PERCIVILIANS BUT THIS MAN USED TO COME DOWN SIT ON THE ROCKS AD WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS AND HE HAD BENOTKAMS AN A CAMERA WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CONVOYS WE COULD TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS AROUND THE OUR CABIN AROUND THE THING BUT NOT A CONVOIY NOT ALLOWED TO AND SO WE REPORTED THIS MAN TO OUR HEADQUARTERS BACK IN THE SIGNAL BACK IN THE STATION HOTEL NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ABOUT IT SO E HE JUST DISAPPEARED NO WE NEVER EVER HEARD WHETHER HE WAS JUST A LOCAL NEWSPAPER MAN OR WHETHER HE WAS A COM KIND OF A SPY OR WHETHER HE WAS JUST INTERESTED IN SHIP WE NEVER HEARD SEE IAM AFRAID IN THOSE DAYS HE WAS ALL NEED TO KNOW YOU NEVER EVER TOLD AND JUST YE LE JUST THANKING UPON THE AMERICANS WHAT YOU ILL USE TO TO AS REAT AS THE AMERICANS GETIS AN HASSO AND YES WHERE THEY WOULD TRY TO BRIBE US THEY WANTED TO COME UP THE SIGNAL STATION AND LOOK OUN LOOK HONEY WE'VE GOT SOME NILONS OR HONEY WE'VE GOT THE NANS ON BOARD YOU KNOW THIS AND WE SO STUPID AND SO CHILDISH WE TOOK A DISLIKE

USE FOR THE ASDIC STATION AND LAMP MOSTLY THE OLDEST AND ALL THE BIG TEN INCH WHICH WAS VERY DIFFICULT OF COURSE TO HANDLE YOU HAD TO GO OUT ON THE BEL AND OF COURTE IF UP THERE THE WINDS WERE ALWAYS AT GALEFORCE AND WE ALWAYS HAD TO HOISTETHE CONES FOR THE WET FOR THE WEATHER EVERY DAY WE HAD TO HOIST THE CONES FOR THE CONVOYS TO KNOW WHAT THE WEATHER WAS WETE THE CONES THE CONES WERE YOU O COMB WITH A SHAPE LIKE THAT AND YOU HOISTED IT NOW COMI WHICH WAY NOW UPWARDS FOR UPWARDS FOR HE NORTH WIND AND DOWNFORS FOR SOUTHWIN VERY PRIMITIVE BUT IT GAVE THEM SOME IDEA OF THE WAY THE WIND I MEN OT

BIGGEST SHIP THOUGH EM ESCORTSHIP EVER REALLY CAME INTO US WHERE WERE DESTROYERS OR OR COVET COFETS AND BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS USED TO GO INTO MALD TO WAIT FOR THE CONVOYS TO GO BACK OUT SO WE NEVER REALLY HAD ANYTHING WHAT I WOULD CALL VERY LARGE I WAS ON WATCH WITH STEPHANE AND ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION AND NOW IF YOU CAN A PICTURE OU KNOW THE ISLANDS AND THE SEA AND SUDDENLY YOU SEE IT A GREAT BIG CROSS ANCHOR ACROSS MOUSE COMING ACTUATELY WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT YOU HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT IT COULD POSSIBLY BE AND WE HAD NO EATY A FOR ANYTHING WE HAD NOTHING WHAT EVERYTHING WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY NER IT GOT BIGGER AND BIGGER WE COULDNT BELIEVE IT OF COURSE T WE CALLED IT UP NO REPLY OF COURSE THAT WAS WORRYING NO REPLY BECAUSE ITS A SPECIAL EVERY EVERY HOUR IT CHANGED THE CALL UP SINK

WEN WERE NOT ALLOWED TO POST ANY MORE LETTERS ALL OUR LETTERS WERE TO BE COUNCED ALL THEIR POSTAGE OUT WAS TO BE COUNSELLED EVERYTHING GOING OUT FROM THE BASE WAS TO BE STOPPED AND WE ALL LEAVE WA STOPPIN WITHA SOMETHING'S IN THE AIR KNOW YOU GET THAT PEAN WE THOUGHT BET WHERE ARE THEY GOING WHAT THEYE GOING TO DO OF COURSE THEY WERE THE BLOCKSHIPS U UN NIGHT BEFORE D DAY TEY SAY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT OR SO THEY SAID UN THE NIGHT BEFORE A THEYALL SEEMED TO BE GETTING READY THE NIGHT BEFORE A BIG SHIP CAME ALONGSIDE SOME OF THEM AND TOOK OFF A LOV OF STAFF WE THOUGHT THEY DON'T USUALLY UNLOAD HERE IT GOES TO GORIC AND GRANOC BUT THEY WERE UNLOADING ALL SORTS OF STUFF WEN WATCHED THEM THROUGH THE TELESCOPE NO CHAIRS AND TABLES AND ALL

THEY ALL JUST SEEMED TO DISAPPEAR AND OUR TWO PATROLSHIPS HAD NO IDEA THEY SAID WHAT DO WE DO WHERE THEY'RE GOING WHERE WERE WAT WE WE HADN'T WE COULDN'T TELL THEM CAUSE IT WAS SO SECRET AND THAT'S THE END OF THE DEDAY THAT WAS ALL THE BLOCKSHIPS GOING DOWN THEY WALL THE ROTTEN OLD SHIPS THAT NOBODY WANTED THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD BEEN SO BATTLESCARRED THAT THEY WERE ALMOST UNTHINKABLE THINKABLE SO THEY WERE THE TWO BIG BLOCKSHIPS AND THESE WERE TO TENT DOWN TO HELP OUT AND WE NEVER EVER HEARD UNTIL THE UND OF THE WAR WER IT WAS ALL ABOUT AND THESE OF THE OVERCY THEN WERE THE BLOCKSHIPS THING THAT YOU TOUCHED ON EARLYE BAT I LIKE MORE CLARIFICATION ON IT IS IS THAT THAT THE CONVOYS ISENSE YOU DID TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENTATION OH CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN AGAIN FOR ME A YOU KNOW HOW THE ROSES A DESPATCH RIDER WOULD ARRIVE FROM BASE IFR THIS STATION HOTEL WICH IS THEIR BASE STACH BRIDER WOULD ARRIVE WITH A CONFIDENTIAL LETTER WHICH WOULD CONTAIN EIGT A OF THE NEXT CONVOY COMING IN AND RIGHT
