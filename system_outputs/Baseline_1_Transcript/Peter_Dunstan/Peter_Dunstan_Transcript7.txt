okay so finally you're on land anyway am as a raw marine in singapore what what do you remember now at this point things were getting a little bit rough the army were fighting a retreat down malacia and the retreat was such that they got over the causeway there's a big big causeway that joins malaya to singapore and the argiles and southern highlanders were the last british troops across the causeway before it was blown blown they dynamited it within within twenty four hours the japs were crossing the the gap which was blown it was more or less just like a little swimming pool but it was decided that the raw marines would join the argyle and southern highlanders who had been cut up very badly in malaya and we were ordered to join the argiles and we fought in the final stages of singapore island with the argiles it became known which is one of the honors in the romarines day of the plymouth argos all the remains came from plymouth the argiles and southern the holes so they couldn't rename them anything else and there was about equal number of the raw marines and the argos so we were called to plymouth argos and it's down in history the a a battalion of the plymouth argos fighting in singapore and you i mean you you've fired huge guns on on a ship and probably you trained with some machine guns but what was it like when you started actually fighting all i can remember about that it was pouring down with body rain we were moved up with the argiles up into the a more or less jungle and a rubber plantation sorry not jungle rubber plantation in the northeast corner of singapore island and i can sort of roughly recall standing under a palm tree pouring down with muddy rain and the next thing we knew was being shot at by the japs and retreating back and retreating back and getting back finally into the argiles barracks in singapore ah and told we had to surrender that was about it what was that like can you remember i can't really i can't really remember just the fact that what i sit with prisoners of war and what was it like when you came face to face with the japanese and and they started moving you about we didn't funny enough the japs ordered all prisoners of war or before that in when we got back to tase park which was the argos headquarters and in the fighting i got a a motor bomb splinter in my left hand the vectors scars still there and i was sent down to singapore general hospital because in the tropics if you ever go in the tropics and you cut yourself that 'll term poison within within hours and of course with that on my knuckle it blew up and i was sent down to singapore general hospital and a ah that was more or less where i was well taken prisoner the japanese i didn't see many japanese any japanese at all they came in and ordered everybody out of singapore a general hospital because they wanted it for their own troops and i was moved with a number of other and allied servicemen who were also there to a small school which was a first aid post and from there up into a change village which is where the japanese they cordoned off the whole of the north northeast corner i think it is of singapore island he's standing and now occupied by the by the singapore am airport and we we were moved up there and i joined the argiles and the marines that were there and that part of it the regimental doctor of course wanted some help and my pal who was a corporal on the repulse and myself had a an argyle volunteered to act as orderlies for the doctor and so we had a special lit place in one of the shops in singapore in change change village which was the medical room and we had we lived in the navy quarters in the back of three of us so we we were separated a little bit but we did all right when did you when did you move out a singer for when when you heard it and am i can't give you exact dates but the a nineteen thirty six fact he's something i'm doing upstairs at the moment and there was a scheme to connect the tire railway to the burmese railway and the japanese had got a they got the plans for this in fact i've found two of the plans that are in existence in the ro geographical society in london i've been up there and trace them and in nineteen thirty six a there were two british one american and one other attempt a or idea to join the railway of tile de burma and the japs got hold of these and this is why you got the the river co railway today because they they got one they used one of the plans but they were shipping us prisons up to build the a tiling railway and six hundred of us crowded into cattle trucks for about three day journey from singapore up to bampong in tiland which was the village where really the whole thing started can you remember much about what that journey was like and and what were your feelings at this point it well you got you you you had no feelings you just just accepted what was carrying on and the journey itself was pretty horrendous because with twenty thirty i can't remember now exactly men crowded into an ordinary a good truck not the big long ones short ones and used to take turns to a to sit by the door he organized it to sit by the door and on the way i can't remember how many stops there were and the japanese gave you a rice and a vegetable soup the rice it was what you see is rice is polished rice but you get a lot of broken rice pieces of rice which are broken during the process and course that is virtually fed to cattle leading a blacier and tieland and that and of course that being virtually free the japanese fed that to us fortunately unpolished rice has a certain amount of vitebit vitamin in it and it did help us quite a bit but we were pretty well starving by the time we got wooded i got hiccups a towards bam pong
