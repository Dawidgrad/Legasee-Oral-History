NOVHER DRAUGHT AND THIS WAS FOR ACHA MISS CARON AND A WWE'RE NOT TOLD WE JUST I'M TOLD WE GOING ON A DRAUT AND WE HAVE A NUMBER O OF DRAFT SO WHEN THE TIME CAME THERE WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED A FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED OF US AN FROM CHATAM WE WRE PUT ON A NAVY TRUCK SOBAK TRAVWELL OVERBACK E OPEN BACK BAT CUPBOARD TRUCK TAKEN DOWN TO THE LONDON STATION I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IT WAS NOW BUT ALL OF US PUT ON ONE TRAIN I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY OTHER CUS ANY OTHER PEOPLE ON THAT TRAIN EVERY ONE UNDER THE DOORS WERE LOCKED WE WERE LOCKED IN AND YOUNG LADBORD AS HALD OM HE SAID KNOW WHAT THAT'S FOR SID YE STOP US GETTING OUT NOVERISH NOIT STOP THE GIR WA GETIN TO US WHEN WE GET TO A STATION I AT STARTED THE CHAT WE GOT FRIENDLY NONE OF US EVER KNEW EACH OTHER WE WECOME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE OR ANYWAY THAT WAS A LONG TRIP UP TO GLASGO GLASGO WE STOPPED QUITE A FEW TIMES AM I THINK FOR A AIR RAGE AND FOR NO REASON I BELIEVE WE STOPPED AT CARLYLE AND AN THE WINDOWS WERE OPENED OF THE CARRIAGES LOVELY CUPS OF TEA AND SANDWAGES PASSED ACROSS FROM THE DEW V S OR WHOEVER NOW ANYWAY AFTER A LITTLE REST ON STARTED THE TRAIN AGAIN AS WE DREW OUT THE STATION I REMEMBERED THERE WAS BIG FACTORY BY THE SIDE OF THE STATION RIGHT ON THE TRACK O AN OLD MILL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND OUT OF THESE WINDOWS THERE WAS BALLOONS AND H GIRLS WAVING THE BLOONS WERE NOT SOME OF THE BLLOONS I CAN REMEMBER I THINK THEY WERE A LITTLE BIS OF ANOTHER TYPE WHICH I WON'T MENTION AM BAT ANY RATE THAT WAS NICE WE LOVED AT THE FACT OF A BEING EUNOW CHEERED ON OUR WAY WE EVENTUALLY ARRIVED INGLASGO A'D E TRAIN CHANGE STRAIGHTWAY OVER TO WHAT MUST HAVE BEEN A LOCAL TRAIN THAT TRAIN TOOK US TO GRENOK OR GRINOS WAS OUR DESTINATION AND WE WERE THEN PUT INTO AM IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE WYM C A A BIG BUILDING AND WE WERE THEN TOLD THAT WE WERE DUE TO AM HAVE BEE TE SHIPP'S COMPANY OF A BRAND NEW SHIP HATS BEIN BUILT IN THE SHIPYARD WHICH WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO TWY I BESAVERI WYAMP SEA REALLY NOW IT WASN'T READY AND WE COULD GO AND LOOK OVER THE SHIP AT ANY TIME WE LIKED A MASS OF WIRES AND AN PEOPLE WELLED IN AND AND I CAN'T REALLY REMEMBER WHAT WE DID WE MUST HAVE WALKED ABOUT GRENOCK A ANYWAY IN A FEW WEEKS THE SHIP WAS READY ORDY OLD WIRES AND BITS AND PIECES HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND WE WERE GIVEN OUR PLACES OS ON THE A FORRID MESDECK WE WER POINTED OUT WHERE WE A HAD OUR LOCKER WHERE WE POT ANEU CLOTHES WE WERE IN UNIFORM NOW OF COURSE ALL OUR CEVILIAN CLOTHES HAD GONE SO WE JUST HAD OUR OL NAVAL CLOTHES THE FIRST OF THINGS WE HAD TO DO GO THROUGH TRIALS THE TRIALS WERE TAKEN UP THE CLIDE TYOU HAD TO DO THE SPEED WHATEVER DETERMINED AND A A AFEW GUNNERY TIRK ITRIALD ANYWAY WHEN WHEN WE FINISHED THE TRIALS AND THE SHIP WAS COMMISSIONED THEN INTO THE WORLD NAVY AND THAT WAS THE TIME WE WAS GOING TO BE OFF NONE OF US WOUD EVE WAS TOLD THAT WE WERE GOING TO GO ON A CERTAIN DAY SO IF WE HAPPENED TO BE HAVING SURE LEAVE WE COULDN'T TELL ANYBODY BUT THEN ONE DARK NIGHT SHORTLY AFTER WE'D FINISHED OUR TRIALS WE SLIPPED FROM THE DOCK DOCKSIDE THE AM OF THE THE YARD THE OTHER YARD AND M EDGED OUR WAY UP THROUGH THE CLIDE NO LIGHTS OF COURSE TE CLOSED ALL THE WATER TIGHT DOORS ALL THE SCUTTLES OR THE DEAD LIGHTS AND A WE WERE GIVEN OUR POSITIONS THAT WE WE'RE ON WATCH THEN WE WERE REAL SAILORS THEN SO M IWAS STARBOARD WATCH SO THEREFOR I WUR BE UP ON THE A HALF AN HOUR UPON THE STARBOARD WAT LOOK OUT WE WE NEVER HAD ANY ACTUAL TRAININ FOR THIS IF WE JUST WERE TOLD TO DO WHAT WE WE WERE TOLD SO ANYWAY WE EGED OUT OF THE CLIDE YOU HAVE TO GO PAST THE BOOM WHICH LETS YOU OUT THE TIDE CLIDE AND I REMEMBER I CAME OFF WATCH O HADN'T GONE ON WACH I CAN'T REMEMBER T THES SDAGE BUT I'D HAD REASON TO GO TO THE HEDGE WHICH ARE THE TOILETS I'D SIT DOWN JUST SITTING DOWN AND THERE'S A ENORMOUS EXPLOSION BANG THE DOORS RATTLED PULLED ME TROWDED UP QUICKLY RUSHED OUT OF TH THE DOOR INTO THE UM WHAT THEY CALLED THE AMCANTEEN FLAT THAT'S JUST A AM PASSAGE WAY AND BUMPED INTO A ONE OF THE OTHER SAILORS WHOSE OFFICE LITLE BIT MORE EXPERIENCE OF ME AS IV WE'D BEEN TORPEDE O THOUR FIRST NOGT OUT NOW IT'S ONLY THE TORPEDOAN TRYING TO DEPCHARG IT OUT BUT SHAMEFACED I DIDN'T GO BACK HE SAID WILL YOU WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE THER ANYWA SO WE HAD A GOOD LAUGH ABOUT THAT ANYWAY FROM THERE AN ETIL SAY IT WAS A DARK NIGHT WHY WAS IT ALL M SO CLAN THIS TIME WHEN YEU LEFTT BUT THI THIS IS ONE OTHE PROBLEMS THAT THE ENEMY A KNEW THAT THER WAS SHIPS BEING BUILT NEARLY ALL THE TIME AND THEY WOULD COME OUT OF ATHE CLIDE OR COME OUT OF THE TINE OR C PERHAPS COME OUT OF AE IRELAND AND IF IF YUF OU CAN VISUALIZE IRELAND AND SCOTLAND AND THERE'S I NARROWS IS REALLY WIDE NO'S A LONG DISTANCE BUT E NARROWS AS AS A CONTINENT AND THEREFORE SHIPS HAVE TO COME IN AND OUT OF THAT AREA WIL THIS WAS ALWAYS THE PLACES WHERE YOU'D HAVE TWO OR THREE YEUBOATS JUST LURKING HOPING FOR A GOOD KILL AND WHETHER THEY EVER FOUND OUT THAT A SHIP FROM ANY SPYYS OR ANYTHING WAS COMING OUT AT THAT TIME I'VE NO IDEA BUT THAT WAS THE MOST DANGEROUS PART BERIS NONE OF US HAD WORKED TOGETHER WE'D ALL COME OUT OF TRAINING WEHAD HAD GOOD TRAINING IN OUR OWN JOBS BUT OF COURSE NOT TO TAIN BECAUSE WE WERE NOT WITH THE SAME PEOPLE WER TRAINYI WITH SO FROM THERE ONWARDS AS YOU RITFRD HEBERDES IT WAS REALLY AM THE PUT THE FEW SAILORS THAT ADEXPERIENCED AND THE OFFICERS OF COURSE WO WERE EXPERIENCE THA OUSA THA HAD TO HAVE ALL THEIR KNOWLEDGE TO DO WHAT YEU WERE DOING ECAUSE YOU'D GET NO ESCORT YOUR SHIP COMPLETELY ON YOUR OWN WITH SEVENTY FIVE PER CENT OF THE CREW THAT HAD NEVER BEEN TO SEA BEFORE NEVER EVEN SEEN A SHIP BEFORE VERY OFTEN SO IF IF WE'D BEEN ATTACKED AT THAT TIME WE WOULD BEEN A SERTIN DUCK WHEN WE ARRIVE AT SCAPAFLO WHICH IS RELATIVELY SAFE WE UM GO THROUGH THE BOOM AGAIN TO GET INTO THE FLOW AND FROM THEN ONWARD TO DO OUR TRAINING WHAT A TRAININ TA SCAPPAFLO REALLY IS TO GET YOU WORKING IT AS A TEAM THE WHOLE SHIP HAS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING A GUN CREW FOUR O FIVE HAS AN OUR TO WORK TOGETHER IF YOUERE IN THE M A TRANSMITTING STATION WHICH IS THE MONE O THE NURSE CENTERS LIKE WE WERE AS GUNNERY CONTROL YOU'D HAVE AABOUT TEN PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM WECHE ONLY IN CHARGE OF AN ORDINARY AND SITTING ROOM AND M EACH ONE OF THOSE HAD A JOB TO DO BECAUSE A ON A DESTROYER WHICH WE WERE ASMISHCAM WAS A DESTROYER A A BRAN NEW RUN AS WELL SO NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND SO WE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE FIRE CONTROL TABLE AS IT WAS WHERE YOU GOT EIGHT PEOPLE ON IT AND ALL THOSE EIGHT PEOPLE ALTHOUGH THEY'RE TRAINED ON SOMETHING SIMILER IN THE TRAININ THEY STILL HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO FIGHT IF THE SHIP'S ATTACKED OR IF WE SHOULD ATTACK ANOTHER SHIP SO THAT WAS WHAT WAS EXPECTED OF US IN THE FLOW UT THAT TIME WE WERE SO SHORT OF DESTROYERS IN PARTICULAR AND OTHER ESCORT SHRIPS SO NOT ONLY WERE WE STAYING IN AN ICE SAFE AREA TO DO OUR TRAINING WE WERE SENT OUT OR IN HARNESS AS IT WAS CALLED WITH ANOTHER SHIP THAT MIGHT BE MORE EXPERIENCE BUT THEN THE CAE OF COURSE THERE'S ONLY ONE OF YOU THAT IS EXPERIENCE AND ONE WHICH IS TROIN AN RICHES US SO HEM WE RELEARNT IT A HARDWAY O ALL OUR REAL FIGHTING AND WAS AROUND THAT TIME AND AT THE END OF NINETEEN FORTY FOUR WHICH WAS IN A OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER A WAS AROUND THAT AREA SO THEY'D SEND US OUT WITH ANOTHER SHIP AND THIS IS IN ONE CASE WE WERE THE ONLY SHIPS THAT ERE IN THE FLOW DESTROYERS AND WE WERE OF COURSE DUE TO DESTROY AN ATIIS BULLON WHICH WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AT THAT TIME A WAS A SHIP THAT GOT SUNK SO WE WERE SENT OUT A WE KNOW NOT NO BASIC TRAININ ON THIS WE HAD A CALL TO GO TO A SHIP OFF CAPE ROTH THAT HAD BEEN SUNK E DIDN'T KNOW O HAD BEEN TORPEDOWED A DIDN'T ACTUALLY OUR MESSAGE WAS NOT THAT I HAD BEEN SUNK THAT THE SHIP HAD BEEN TORPEDOWED AND TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO GO OUT TO TRY AND HELP TO CATCH THE NEW BOAT THAT HAD SUNK IT AND TO PICK UP SURVIVORS IF THERE WERE ANY THERE SO THERE WAS TWO OF US AND IT SEEMED AM FROM E RECORDS I LOOKED UP THE OTHER SHIP THAT WENT OUT WITH US WAS ANOTHER SHIP TA AS ALSO WORKING OUT SO THESE TWO DESTROYERS WID ABSOLUTELY NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL AND HAD TO GO OUT TO THE SHIP I FOUND OUT LATER IN LIFE IT WAS ATE MISS BULLON WHICH WAS A ESCORT VESSEL AND THEY'D BEEN LOOKING FOR A YEW BOAT THE VERY EW BOAT THEY'DE BEEN LOOKING FOR HIT ONE OF OUR SHIPS FIRST SO ATMISS BULLANDAN AD BEEN SUNK AND A THE OTHER SHIPS THAT WERE WITH ER WERE STILL LOOKING FOR THE THE EW BOAT WELL AM THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS A OUR SKIPPER WAS VERY KNOWLIGIBLE VERY EXPERIENCED AND HE WENT TO THE POSITION WHETHE YOU BUT WHERE THE EUBOAT HAD SUNK ACAMISS AM AS YE WAS BULLIN NOBODY WAS TOLD ANYTHING HE KNEW ITS AGE MISS BULLAN NONE OF US WERE TOLD SO THE FIRST THING YOU DO YOU GO ROUND DEPT YOR DEP CHARGE IN THE WHOLE OF THE AREA IN CASE THE EUBOAT IS STILL THERE WHERE WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH TOLD OUR ASICAL OPERATOR THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING DOWN THERE WHICH COULD BE THE YEUBOAT SO WE DETHCHARGED THAT AREA AND APPARENTLY THE AM ECHO WE GOT DIDN'T MOVE ICH STAYED THERE SO WE ASSUMED THAT THAT WAS A EWBOAT AND A NEVER NEVER CAME UP NEVER GOT ANY OIL NEVER GOT ANYTHING SO AM AT THAT TIME OF THE WAR THE AN SNARKER HAD ONLY JUST STARTED SO WHICH HELPED THEM OT ON IN THE WAR NOW TIS YEU BO IF IT DIDN'T COME UP WITHIN TWELVE HOURS THEN IT WAS A DEAD DUCK SO WE WAITED AROUND THERE ALL NIGHT WITH A BOARDING PARTY READY TO GO ON TO THE EWBOA CAUSE IT WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME UP FR WER IF IT HADN' BEEN AND THEN IT SEEMED WE HAD TO GO ON ANOTHER JOB I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE RECEIVED THE MESSAGE OR BUT WE HAD TO GO ON AN ESCORT JOB SO WE STOOD DOWN THE WHOLE TEAM I WAS LOOKING THIS OF THE NEXT MORNING WE STOOD TOWN THE A TEAM OF THE BOARDING PARTY AN OD LOOKING OVER THE SIDE O THE SHIP I HAD NO WORK TO DO WAS OFF WATCH AND I COULD SEE IN THE NEAR DISTANCE A MAGNETIC MIND FLOAT PAST BUT NOBODY SHOT AT IT WHICH TEY MIGHT D UNUSUALLY JUST IN CASE THERE WAS A NEW BOAT DOWN AND WOULD KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL THERE WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE ALL NIGHT YOU NEVER STARTED YOUR ENGINES CAUSE YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT YEW BOAT IF IT WAS STILL ALIVE THERE DOWN THERE TO KNOW THAT WE WERE STILL UP THERE WAITING TO WIN THE END WE M WENT BACK TO SCAPAFLO AND CARRIED ON WITH OUR AN LEARNING TO FIGHT WAR TELL ME ABOUT CHRISTMAS SAY SCAPR WELL AND THIS WAS THIS THAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT WAS THE SIXTH OF DECEMBER OR THESMALL JOBS WE MIGHT HAVE DONE THERE I'M NOT SURE BUT THE NEXT IMPORTANT THING THAT I CAN REMEMBER IS THAT WE WERE AN NOT REQUIRED FOR WORK AROUND THE CHRISTMAS PERIOD SO WE WERE BACK IN SCAPARFLO AND IT WAS QUIET AND WE WERE SAFE BUT NONE OF US HAD HAD US CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME BEFORE THIS AND THERE WE ALL WERE IN A DEAD PLACE SCAPELO SCAPEFLO'S A TERRIBLE PLACE DEAD AS ANYTHING AND WHAT SURPRISED ME WAS EI'S TWO HUNDRED ON THI SHIP ROUGHLY TO UNDE SHIP'S COMPLIMENT AND LUCKILY WE HAVE A FEW AMONGST US THAT WERE EXPERIENCED AND THERE WE WERE THE COOKS AN THE MESS WERE MAKIN CHRISTMAS CAKES WIR WHATEVER STUFF WE COULD GET HOLD OF YOU ALSO MANAGE TO GET I'M NOT SURE WHEREFROM A CHRISTMAS TREE FOR SOMEWHERE AND THAT IS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE MAST ON THE TOP OF EVERY SHIP AT CHRISTMAS TIME OF THER OWN HARBOUR THE HAVE A CHRISTMAS TREE WHICH IS RUN UP ON THE TOP OF THE SHIP AND AN WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED I THINK BY THE OFFICERS BEIN CHRISTMAS BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER WHETHER WE WERE OR NOT AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE DRINK ON BOARD IT'S A DRY SHIP AT SOME OF THE OLD STAGES HAD SAVED SOME OF THEIR RUM RASION WHICH YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO BECAUSE ES VERY BARE VERY HIGH CHARGE AS YEU ERE CAUT BUT THE OFFICERS NORMALLY ON US ON A SMALL SHRIP LIKE A DESTROYER CLOSE HEUR EYES TO LOTS O THE THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO IF THEY WERE ON A BIG SHIP THAT WE CALL A PASSER SHIP SO MANY OF THE LADS THAT WERE ALLOWED RUM I WASN'T BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO RUMN TILL YOU'RE TWENTY AND I WAS ONLY EIGHTEEN AM BUT OUT CAME THE RUM RUSHIIN ORRIBLE I HATE IT AM AND ON PEOPLE MADE UP THINGS OUT OF PAPER AM I THINK SOME A PACKEG IN PAPER RED GREEN AND BLUE CAME FROM DIFFERENT PLACES OUT OF HOIDY HOLES AND MADE INTO DECORATIONS AND A WE WERE MORED AT A BOY THERE AF THE TIME AND WSINGING CHRISTMAS SONGS AND PIT SOME OF THE PEOPLE AD INSTRUMENTS IR WE HAD A SMALL BAND ON BOARD AND O SOME O THE PEOPLE I S'PPOSE THAT CAME AT SOME OF OUR LADS WHO COME FROM HOMES THA NEVER HAD IT BAD I THINK I AS VERY TEARFUL FOR HIM A I CAME FROM E A HOME THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MONEY SO CHRISTMAS WASN'T MUCH DIFFERENT FOR ME SO ANYWAY WE ALL ENJOYED OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS AWAY FROM HOME AND IN A PLACE LIKE SKAPPERFLOW SO THAT WAS QUITE GOOD AM COMMANDER WILKINSON A WAS OUR OUR CAPTAIN AND EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE GIVEN A LIF FOR HIM REALLY AFTER WE'VE BEEN RIVING FOR A TIME CUS ALDHOUGH HE WAS VERY STRICT AM HE WAS QUITE HAPPY TO TURN IS LI E WAS HE WAS A LAD THE SAME OF US AM LATE ON AIN THE STORY WHEN WE GOT UT FA EAST AM I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT BUT HE WE HAD AM MULTIPOLO TEAMS AND HE WAS ON THE TEAM WITH THE LEDGE AGAINST THE OFFICERS AND HE THAT WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON HE WOULD BE AND A HE WAS I THINK BOXING CHAMPION OF E OF THE FLEET OR PART OF THE FLEET AND YET HE WAS SUCH A NICE PERSON YOU KNOW AND THERE IS ANOTHER CASE I'LL TALK IT TO N LOOK OLE WHEN IL GO ASHORE SO AM BUT THE NEXT THING WE WE WENT ON REALLY AFTER CHRISTMAS AFTER CHRISTMAS WAS WHEN WE REALLY STARTED AM LEARNIN THAT THERE WAS A WAR ON WE WOULD STILL GO OUT AND WOULD STILL GO OUT AS A SHIP WORKIN UP TOGETHER BUT THE FIRST ONE A WE WEMET WE WENT OUT WITH I BELIEVE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS AND THIS WAS TO BE A STRIKE AGAINST NORWAY WE DIDN'T KNOW TILL WE WERE AT SEA THAT WE WERE DOING THIS BUT THERE WAS THESE TWO AIRCRAFT CARRIERS SOME MORE DESTROYERS I THINK AND OM SOME OTHER SHIPS NOW OUR AIR JOB WAS NOT ONLY TO PROTECT THE AM ONE OF THE CARRIERS BUT IT WAS ALSO TO ACT AS AM A LIFE BOAT REALLY WET WHEN THE AM AIRCRAFT TOOK OFF AND I THINK A COUPLE OF THESE WERE ER OLD TYP AIRCRAFT AM I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF E BUT THEY WERE BYPLANES NOW THIS WAS A REALLY ROUGH DAY AND THEY TOOK OFF O I WATCHED THEM OTIN OM MUCH ALL THE TIME AND I WATCHED EM FROM THE DECK AND THE CARRIER WAS BOUNCING UP AND DOWN BUT THEY TOOK OFF AND I THINK THEY CARRIED OUT OR TRIED TO CARRY OUT THEIR TASK BUT THE TWO I SHAW COME BACK DIDN'T MAKE IT CAUSE THEY THE SHIP WAS DANCING UP AND DOWN THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER DANCING UP AND DOWN AND I BELIEVE ONE OF THEM HIT THE DECK AND WAS PUSHED OVERBOARD THAT'S WITH THE PEOPLE IN IT THEY CAN'T TAKE HIM OUT PUSHED HEM OVER TO MAKE WAY FOR ANOTHER ONE LANDING AND THE OTHER ONE DISAPPEARED I THINK HE WAS GIVEN ORDERS TO TRY AND FLY BACK TO HIS BASE OR A BASE BECAUSE IT W'AS TOO ROUGH TO LAND ON THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER WE A I THINK IT BEING CRASHBOAT I WAS CALLED WE UM WENT TO TRY AND FIND THE AIRCRAFT THAT WA DITCHED SADLY NO AIRCRAFT SO ANYWAY I THINK THEY HAD TO CALL OFF TE STRIKE COULD BE JUST TOO TOO DANGEROUS TO DO ANY MORE THAN FLYIN OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO THAT WAS REALLY A BAD BEGINNIN TO MY WAR AH WE WENT BACK TO SCARPA YOU TOLK ABOUY BEING ROUGH HOW WERE YOUR FEELINGS TERRIBLE I WAS SEASICK MOST TIMES I WENT TO SEE BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOURE ON WHEN YOU'RE ON THE LOOKOUT OR WHEN YOU'RE IN THE T S WHICH IS INCAM THE T S IS DOWN BELOW AM AND THAT IS THE TRANSMITTING STATION THAT TAKES THE THAT'S LIKE A RELAY FROM THE DIRECTOR TOWER WHICH IS RIGHT UP THE TOP OF THE SHIP THROUGH YOU IN A T S TO THE MAIN ARMAMENT WHICH IS FOUR FOUR INCH GUNS SO AM I WAS HE COMMUNICATION NUMBER SO THE DIRECTOR WOULD SPEAK TO ME THE OFFICER TWO OFFICERS INEDIRECTOR WOULD BE SPEAKING TO ME AND I WOULD BE SPEAKING TO THE GUNS BUT PART FROM THAT M THE DIRECTOR WOULD HAD INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD AM SEND SIGNAL DOWN TO OUR BIG COMPUTER THE ORIGINAL AM MECHANICAL COMPUTER AND TE MECHANICAL COMPUTER WED SEND THAT INFORMATION MECHANICALLY TO THE GUNS AM BUT ONCE I GOT INTO A POSITION WHERE THERE IS EXCITEMENT I FORGOT ALL ABOUT SEA SICKNESS I WAS OCAY SO THAT'S A GOOD THING BUT NORMALLY IF I WASN'T AM ON ON WOCH OR SENDING ID BE STANDING ON THE UPPER DECK WATCHING THE SEA HEAVING UP AND DOWN AND PROBARLY BEING SICK THE ONLY TIME YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS IS WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTIN ACTION YOU KNOW AM LATER ON WEN I I TALK ABOUT THE MINELAN WE WERE AT ACTION STATIONS ALL THE TIME BUT IF YOU'RE DOING A JOB JUST ESCORTIN THEN YOUR AT CRUSIN STATIONS AND UNTIL SOME TROUBLE POPS UP M DEPTH CHARG IN EU BOATS IS NOT A CASE OF GOING TO ACTION STATIONS IT'S ONLY IF THE A EUBOAT FIGHTS BACK THEN YOU GO TO ACTION STATIONS SO ANYWAY AMN WE WENT FROM THERE BACK TO SCAPPARFLO AM I THINK WE DID ONE OR TWO JOURNEYS LIKE THIS AM OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY AND THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF NINETEEN FORTY FIVE AND EVENTUALLY AM WE SUPPOSEDLY FINISHED OUR TRAINING OF WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM MIND YOU ALL THIS TIME I'M A TERRE TALKING TO ABOUT NOW WE WERE STILL LEARNING BECAUSE WE WERE SSIL TEAMING UP WITH PEOPLE THAT WE NEVER WORKED WITH BEFORE SO IF WE'D RUN INTO ANY REAL TROUBLE AT THAT TIME WE WOULDN'T HAVE STOOD A LOT OF CHANCE IT WASN'T TO LATEO ON WHEN WE HAD LEARNT THESE THINGS SO A THE NEXT ONE I THINK M IS AN IMPORTANT ONE THIS IS IN ABOUT FEBRUARY I BELIEVE WE WERE JUST TOLD WE WERE GOING OUT I THINK THAT NIGHT AND WE WERE NOT GIVING ANY REAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE WE WERE GOING OR WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO BUT IT WAS A VERY BIG DO THERE WAS A VERY LARGE FORCE AND IT WAS WE LEFT ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT I BELIEVE I IS A FERSCA THIS IS OUT A SCAPPER AND THIS IS THIS IS WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE THE MINE LONE AND OPERATION AM IT IT WAS A VERY IT WAS VE ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO MOON IT WAS ALL STARLIGHT SO IT WAS VERY GOOD VISIBILITY AND IT WAS A VERY CALM NIGHT STRANGE ENOUGH HARDLY ANY ROUGH SEA OR ANYTHING AND WE SHET OUT AND OFCOURSE YOU SELDOM KNOW WHO'S WITH YOU YOU IT'S TE SILENT SERVICE YOU'RE NOT TOLD ANYTHING AND WE'D BEEN ABOUT OUT ABOUT AN HOUR I BELIEVE ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AND THE SKIPPER THEN SED OVER TO TENOY WHAT WE WAS GOING TO DO HE'D OPENED HIS ORDERS AND HE TOLD US THAT WE A WE WERE A BIG FORCE ONE OF THE LARGE FORCE WERE GOING A DOWN THE SOUTH SOUTHERN PART OF NORWAY TO EGESAND AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY WE WERE JUST ONE OF TWO SHIPS AM THE OTHER ONE WAS AZELIUS SAME SIDE THE SAME DESTROYER AS WE WERE AND OUR MAIN AM TASK WE WE HAD TO ESCORT THIS AM MINELAER ATIPIS APOLLO AND FIRST OF ALL BOTH FORCES WORKING TOGETHER HAD TO PASS THROUGH A BIG MINE FIELD AA THERE'S A BIG MINE FIELD THAT' LAYD OTHING BY US AM AND AM WE HAD TO GO THROUGH ONE PATH FOR IT WICH SWOUS THE ONLY PASS THROUGH IT BUT WE KNEW WHERE THE OPENING WAS SO IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE ENOUGH BUT YOU DO GET LOOSE MINES SO OUR ASTEC OPERATOR HAD TO AM PICK OUT THE MINES THE BOAT AND I WAS ON WATCH AT ONE TIME AND I COULD HEAR HEAR HIM SAYING AM THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ON THE PORT SIDE AND THE CAPTAIN WOULD MOVE THE SHIP OVER A BIT SO ANYWAY WE GOT THROUGM THE MIND FILLE O ALL OF US WITH NO REAL PROBLEM AND AM THEN WE SPLIT UP A WE WERE TO WAIT TILL TWELVE O'CLOCK AND AT THAT TIME AT TWELVE O'CLOCK THE OTHER BIG FORCE WEN WE WERE BY THE WAY UP NER SDAVAYA AT THAT POINT AND THE OTHER BIG FORCE WAS TWO CRUISERS I THINK AAN NO AIRCRAFT CARRIES AT THAT POINT AND THEY WERE GOING TO ATTACK A CONVOY A GERMAN CONVOY THAT WAS GOING TO LEAVE EGESAND AND WAS GONG TO HUG THE COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO AM STISTEVANGA WHERE WE WERE WUT WETHE OTHER FORCES TO STOP IM GETTIN THERE SO DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK THE AM THE OTHER FORCE WERE GOING TO ATTACK THE CONVOY AND THEY WERE HOPIN IN THAT CAE WHEN THAT STARTED THERE'D BE LOTS OF FIREWORKS DOWN FURTHER ALONG THE COAST IS QUITE A FEW HUNDRED MILES BUT THAT WOULD TAKE THE HEAT OFF WHAT WE WERE DOING WE WERE A CLANDESTINE OPERATION THE A WE WERE TO ESCORT THE APOLLO TO THE POINT WHERE SHE WAS GOING TO START LAYING MINS DEAD ON TWELVE O'CLOCK AND WE WERE TO BE BETWEEN HER IN AND THE NORWEGIAN COAST AND IF AF SHE WAS SIGHTED ON BY THE GERMANS A OR PICKED UP BY RADOG BY THE GERMANS AND THEY WERE TO START FIRING WE WERE TO MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS WE COULD AND TEAR UP AND DOWN THE BIT OF SEA BETWEEN US AND BETWEEN THE APOLLO AND THE A NORWEGIAN COAST AND USE ALL THE GUNS AND FLARES AND EVERYTHING WE COULD TO TAKE THE HEAT OFF HER SO THEY'D ATTACK US AND SO THE APOLLO AND WOULD HAVE EITHER FLUSHED US OR INDICATED TO US OR NOT ON THE SHORE BECAUSE YOU CAN GIVE EVERYBODY HAD TO KEEP RADIO SILENCE AND A WE WERE ON SILENT ROUTINE NOBODY WAS ALLOWED TO SMOKE SHOW ANYTHING WE WERE NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO THE BANG BECAUSE THE NOISE AN WE WERE NOT FAR AWAY FROM THE COAST ER TO AND ABUT THE SHIPS BOTH US AND THE OTHER ESCORT DESTROYED ASELIUS HAD TO KEEP UP AS MUCH STEAM AS WE COULD BECAUSE IF THE FIREWORKS STARTED WE WERE TO HAVE TO AT FULL SPEED RUSH UP AND DOWN THIS BIT OF COAST FIRING WHATEVER WE COULD PREVENT THEM TO THE APOLLO WELL I COULD HEAR FROM THE GUNS CAUSE I WAS IN THE UM A T S AND FROM THE DIRECTOR AN BEFORE WE STARTED DOING ANYTHING AND I COULD HEAR THE PEOPLE OF TA GAN SAYING WELL I CAN SEE THE HEAD LIGHTS THERE THEY'RE JUST JUST OVER THERE A LITTLE BIT E CAR COMING DOWN GOING FROM THE RIGHT TO THE LEFT AN I COULD HEAR ALL THIS TES AY HOPE THEY CAN'T SEE US FROM WHEE THEY ARE AND THEN HE SAID RIGHT THEY'VE STARTED DOWN THE OTHER END AND THEY STARTED FIRIN DOWN AT THE OTHER END THEY ATTACKED HIS CONVOY AND M THEY WERE BEN OUCANSE WE COULDN'T I COULDN'T SHEN YE ANYWAY CAUSE I'S DAWND IN THE T S BUT I'S GETTING ALL THE MESSAGES FROM A NOT THE TWO OFFICERS UP IN THE A A DIRECT TE TOWER BUT FROM MY MATES ON AGUN BEGN EX GAN AND WYGUN THEY ARE FUNDNIN IN ALL THE INFORMATION IN THE MA SHAYD LOK I THINK THAT BLEWS SMOKING OVER THE YOU KNOW ON THAT O I REALLY CAN'T SEE US ANYWAY APPARENTLY THEY DIDN'T WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO MUCH BUT SO WE WERE SLOWLY CRUIZING UP AND DOWN AND THE UM APOLLO STARTED LEAIN OUR MINDS DEAD ON TIME DED ON TWELVE O'CLOCK TOW THE THE MINELAR ITS A BIG MINE LAER THEY'VE CARRIED A LOT OF MINDS A BIG CRUISER THEY ARE AND ONCE EY START LAYING THE MINE AND THAT'S I WHERE WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO COME IN THEY CAN'T STOP THEY'VE GOT TO DO THE WHOLE OF THEIR MINE LAYIN BECAUSE THE MINE FO AS BEIN LAID SO THEY CAN'T TURN BACK THEY CAN ONLY GO ON AND CARRY ON LAYING THEIR MINDS SO ANYWAY WE'RE JUST GOING SLOWLY UP AND DOWN AND AND BECAUSE OUR SHIP WAS KEEPING STEAM UP READY FOR A QUICK DASH UP AND DOWN THE VELVE BLEW SO YOU GOT A NORMAL WHAT IS A WELL KNOWN DESTROYER HOOT WHOOP WHOOP WHOOP WHICH WE DO EVERY TIME WE COME IN AND OUT OF HARBOUR JUST TO SIGNAL AND APPARENTLY EVERYBODY WENT MAD THE CRUISES WEN'T MAD LIVED IN SILENT ROUTINE YOU KNOW AND EN THE FACT THAT WE WERE NEVER SO STOUT NOT TO THE VERY END AND I THINK IT MIGHT EVEN BE IF ANYBODY HAD HEARD THAT WHOOP WHICH IS A A WELL KNOWN BRITISH DESTROYER SIGNALLED TO SAY YONO'M COMING INTO HARBOUR OR SOMEWHERE OF THE'D THOUGHT NO CAN'T BE A BRITISH DESTROYER NOT BEIN IS DAFT ENOUGH TO DO A THING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW SO ANYWAY AMN THEY LAID THEY LAID THE MINES AND THEN WE KNEW I DON'T NOW BOT SIGNOR OR WHAT SHE SAID ALL DONE NOW WE CARRIED OUR AURMISSION SEE YOU BACK IN PORT AND I WAS AT THAT TIME LISTENING TO SOME OF THE E MUDER AND THEY WERE SAYING LOOK AT ER MOVE AND SHE WAS DOING FORTY KNOTS SHE RUN THE FASTER SHIPS THER WERE AND THEY COULD SEE THE BO WAVE ANDI IIS IS NIGHT BUT AM IT WAS STARLIGHT AND YOU COULD SEE YOU COULD SEE THE SHORE YOU COULD SEE THE PLACE WHERE THE GUNS WERE WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A CRACK AT US HAD THEY'D KNOWN AND OM AWAY WENT THE AM OPOLLO AND AM AT SPEED AND AM WE TURNED ROUND BUT WE WE WENT AS FAR AS WE COULD BUT WE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO GO AT A GOOD SPEED BECAUSE WE GOT A SIGNAL THAT THE GERMANS AD SUST OUT THAT THEY WERE BEING TTACKED ESPECIALLY FROM EAGERSAND WITH THE BATT WE AD ON DOWN NOW AND SOME FRIENDS OF MINE AFTERWARDS ON THE APOLLO WHEN I TOOK TUCH OF HEM THEY SAID THEY UNDERSTOOD AND THEY WERE IN THE UMTAMOLISTER TELEGRAPHY OFFICE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT WE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED O THE FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED COUD HAD PICKED US UP ON RADAR THE FORCE HAD BEEN CHALLENGED AND HE THINKS THAT THE AM APOLLO WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF COURSE HAD GIVEN THE RIGHT CHALLENGE A ANSWER BUT THEN THEY CHALLENGED AGAIN LATER ON AND DIDN'T CAS THE APOLLO HAD STARTED DISAPPEARING SO THEY SENT TORPEDO BOMBERS AFTER US AND AM THEY NEVER FOUND US SO WE GOT BACK OCAY SO THE MANED IS SUCCESSFUL OUR FORCE DOWN THEM FURTHER INKINKASAND A EGASAND AD STOPPED THE CONVOY GOIN UP TO GERM AD THE GERMAN CONVOY THEYHAD UN SUNK ONE OR TWO OF THE SHIPS AND ONE OR TWO OF OUR SHIPS HAD ADDINJURED PEOPLE BUT UM THIS WHOLE MISSION WAS SUCCESSFUL IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU ERE EXPENDIBLE WHEN YOU ARE OUT THERE HUNG HERE WITH THE APOLO YOU AR WHY IS IT O LLITO A DESTROYER WITH A VALUBLE BIT OF KIT TALK A BIT ABOUT THE ROLL OF DESTROYER AND AND IT'S COMFORTABLES YE BECAUSE WHAT WAT I WHY SHOUD WAT I SHALL BRING IN IS BECAUSE LATER ON A'M WHERE WHEN TOWARD THE END OF THE WAR WHICH WON'T BE IN TAT ONE IS WHEN WE WERE A BIG FORCE ESCORTIN A SOME OF THE CRUISERS OUT TO THE FAR EAST WE ONLY TOOK IM AS FOR GIBRALTAR YOU SEE AND THEN ANOTHER FORCE TAKES OVER BUT WE WERE ESCORTIN A BATTLESHIP THE RENOWN AND WE WERE THE CLOSE ESCORT ONE DESTROYER EACH SIDE FAIRLY CLOSE WHEREAS OTHERS WERE FURTHER OUT AND IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY LIKE THIS AND I WASN'T ON MY JU UST LEANING OVER THE SIDE BUT WE WERE QUITE CLOSE BECAUSE THE CLOSE ESCOR YOU SEE AND I'M JUST LEANING OVER THE SIDE AND OVER THE TANNOI COMES THE VOICE FROM THE CAPTAIN WERE NOW REACHING A DANGEROUS AREA AND THERE MIGHT BE YEUBOATS ROUND IF A YEU BOAT AS FAR AS A TORPEDO AND THAT IS APICNOR WAE WE WE SEE THAT TO TRACK OF THAT TORPEDO HEADING TOWARDS BIG SISTER WHICH THEY CALLD TA RENOWN THEN WE STOP IT YOU KNOW WHAT WE MEAN Y STOP IT AND THERE'S ME LOOKING OVER THE SIDE LOOKING AT THE TORPEDO BOLGE ON THE RENOWN AND THINKING YEURSELF YES YOU CAN LOSE TWO HUNDRED MEN JUST A TOP O A TORPEDO BENDING LITL TORPEDO BOLGE YOU KNOW TE A SEL MY A BIT ABOUT THE ROLL OF A DESTROYER WELL ROROLOR THA MOST DESTROYERS IS THEYRE FAST AND THEIRE MANEUVERABLE AND THEY'RE LIKE A SMALL ERVERSION OF A CRUISER THEY HAVE AL DE GUNNERY BUT SMALLER GUNS SO THY'VE GOT FOUR BIG GUNS FOUR POINT FIVE BIG GUNS AND OTHER SMALLER GUNS SO THEY GOT ALL THOSE THE ONE THING THEY'VE GOT EXTRA AM APART FROM THE SMALLER SIDE SCALED DOWN A THE BIG SHIPS HAVE NOT GOT ANTI SUBMARINE EQUIPMENT THEY'VE GOT TORPEDORS AND THINGS BUT UNLESS THEY'RE SUBMARINES ON THE SURFACE THEY'E GOT NO DEATH CHARGES SO AM A DESTROYER HAS STEP CHARGES SO WE WE'RE THERE TOO BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE DIFFERENCE THE REASON WHY YOU GOT THE DESTROYER AS WELL IS JUST AS I SAID IF THE AMCAPITAL SHIP OR WHATEVER IS YOUR GARDEN IS TORPEDO'D THE LAST RESULT IS YOU GETTING IHE WAY OF THE TORPEDO THEY'D RATHER LOSE A SHIP THAT'S ONLY GOT TWO HUND TWO HUNDRED MEN ON BOARD THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MEN ON THE BATTLE SHIP REMOTE AS IT MIGHT BE IF IT'S GOT A TORPEDO BULGE AND THIS IS WHY WE SHAW A TO OF SHOR OF DESTROYERS BECAUSE SO MANY OF THEM GGET LOST BECAUSE THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN A TORPEDO IS SIGHTED IS TO GO TO ATTACK THE SUBMARINE THAT FIRED IT BUT YOU SHOULD BE NEAR ENOUGH TO GETIN A WAY OF TE TORPEDO IF IT HAPPENS TO BE HEADIN YOUR WAY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALKED A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WORDS ID SEEME YOU WERE VERY YOUNG CRUG WIS THERE A MOMENT WHEN YOU WERE ON BOARD WHERE YOU THOUGHT WE'RE WORKING BRILLIANT YOU KNOW I'M WELL NOT REALLY YOU JUST SARL FIT IN AND PART OF LIFE IS YOU YOU MANAGE TO FIT INTO EVERY SITUATION IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH AND AN YOU ALTHOUGH I' NEVER WORRIED AND YOU THINK BECAUSE YOURE A GOOD SWIMMER YOU MUST BE ALWAY EVEN IF THE SHIP SINKS BUT THEN WHEN YOU WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT AND YOU SPEAK TO OTHER PEOPLE A YOU'VE GOT SEA BOOTS ON AT THE TIME A YOU HAVE A A BELT WHICH UM SHOULD SHAVE YOU WHICH YOU WEAR ALL THE TIME AT SEA BUT YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT BELT BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT GETS IN THE WAY OF YOUR ARMS AND EVERYTHING SO WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU HAVE TO JUMP INTO THE HOGGIN AS THEY CALL IT THE SEA THAT BELT MUSTN'T BE BLOWN UP BECAUSE IT MIGHT BREAK YOUR ARMS SO YOU'RE EXPECTED TO BLOW THAT UP WHEN YOU HIT THE SEA AND AI CAN'T SEE AYOU GET LUCKLY I NEVER HAD TO BUT I HAVE E SURVIVORS THAT HAVE TOLD ME YES I HAD TO BLOW IT UP AS SOON AS I HIT THE WATER AND I HAD NO BREATH AT ALL LEFT A COULDN'T BLOW IT UP BUT THE SEA BOATS DRAG YOU DOWN BECAUSE THE DHISH IS WHAT YOU'RE WEARIN A IS IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHATS THE NEXT BIG EVENT THAT YOU RECALL HIM AM WETHE IT WAS REALLY MONDAN MOST O THE THINS EVE EVEN AM AS ESCORT TO THE MONSTERS THAT WE DID TYOUR ENEMY IN MOST CASES WAS A SA WE GOT BATTERED LEFT RIGHT AND CENTER TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE A QUEEN MARY AND QUEEN ELIZABETH BECAUSE AS WE TOOK THEM OUT AT THE CLIDE WE ZIGJAGGED ALL THAWAY WITH EM AND WE KEPT UP WITH EM TILL THEY REACHED THEIR TOP SPEED WHICH AWAS DE DISTANT ABOUT FURTHER THE WAY ACROSS AND THEN WE LEFT THEM AND WE EITHER WAITED AROUND FOR THE NEXT ONE COMING IN OR INSTANCE WE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN E QUEEN MARY OUT AND WE MIGHT HAVE HAD TO WAIT JUST A FEW HOURS FOR THE QUEEN ELIZABETH TO COME IN AN AN ALL THE TIME ONE OF YOU MIGHT PICK UP ONE OF THE THREE OF YOU AT SER QUEEN MARY WOULD HAVE ITS OWN ASDICK BESIDES ITS OWN RADIL AND WE OF COURSE WERE AT THE ASDIK AND TH RADAR AND OUR COHORT PERHAPS A CAVALIER WOULD BE THE SAME WELL WHEN WE'D STEAM OUT WE WOULD PROBABLY BE A PART AT AT THE EXTREMES OF YEU ACASTIC CIRCLE AND YOU RADOR CIRCLE SO A YOU DIDN'T INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHER'S RECEIT OF THE WAVE AND IF WE PICKED UP AN ECHO WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE SUBMARINE MIGH HAE BEEN A WRECK WULL IMMEDIATELY I WE'D RUN UP A BLACK FLAG ON OUR FLAG DECK SO THE QUEEN MARY WOULD KNOW AND THE'LL SHO THE CAVALIER WOULD KNOW THAT WE'VE PICKED UP AN ECHO IMMEDIATELY WE'D HIVE OFF TO ATTACK THAT ECHO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE IN TROUBLE IF IT IS IF THAT'S A YEUBOAT YE MIGHT HAVE ALREADY FIRED ITS TORPEDO AND THIS IS WHERE YOU TURN OFF SWIFTLY AT FULL SPEED IF YOU CAN IF YOU GOT A BEAM SE AS YOU CA TURN OFF LEFT OL RIGHT YOU HIT WITH A BEAM SEA THE DESTROY GOT HARDLY ANY DRAUGHT YOU'LL TURN OVER STRAIGHT WAY SO YOU HAVE TO BE VERY WIKET WE NEVER DID WHETHEVER IT'S LUCK ORDERS BY JUDGMENT I DON'T KNOW BUT ANY RATE THEN IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HIT BY A TORPEDO THEN YOU'D FIND YOUR WAY TO WHEREVER THE AMECHO WAS AND YOU WOULD ATTACK THE ECHO SO YOU'D LOOSE OFF ABOUT TWO DEP CHARGES FROM ONE SIDE TO FROM THE OTHER AND ROLL OFF OFF THE TWUE RECKS FROM THE REAR SO AS T PATEN ABOUT TEN CHARGES WELL IF THE UBO IS A VERY EXPERIENCED ONE AND HE WAS WATCHING YOU ON THE PERESCOPE HE WOULDN'T BE THERE WHEN YOU ARRIVED HE WOULD ITHER HAVE GONE DOWN LOW OR HE WOULD HAVE DISAPPEARED IN ANOTHER DIRECTION BUT AT LEAST YOU KEPT HIM DOWN THERE'S NO CHANCE OF HIM HITTING YOUR CHARGE AND A THEN WE'D HAVE TO TRY TO CATCH IT UP TAKES ABOUT HALF A DAY BECAUSE THE THEY'RE KEEPING THE SAME SPEED EVEN IF THE TWO DESTROYERS HAD TO LEAVE THO QUEEN MARY OR TO QUEEN ELIZABETH THE QUEEN MARY WOULD CARRY ON IT WOULDN'T STOP AND ONE OF THE WORST SHINGS THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY'D ACTUALLY TORPEDOD TO QUEEN MARY THEN TE WOULD HAVE LOST A LOT OF LIVES BECAUSE WHILE YOURE THE QUEEN MARY W IF IT'S COMING BACK IN TO'LL HAVE A A FULL COMPLIMENT OF AMERICAN JUAS AND THAT WOULD BE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND IT WOULD BE CARRYING NOW THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TIGHTEN UP THEIR WATERTIHT DOORS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING FROM THE DIFFERENT DECKS ALL THE TIME IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IF WE GO INTO ACTING STATIONS THEN WE CLOSE OUR WATERTIGHT DOORS WHICH MEANS IF YOUR TORPEDO OR MIND IT WILL ONLY DAMAGE THE COMPARTMENT WHERE YOURE WITHIN SO THE SHIP MOST LIKELY WON'T SINK BUT IF IT'S ON TO QUEEN MARY DIDN'T HAVE GOT NO CHANCE OF ANY OF THEIR WATER TIGHT DOORS BEING CLOSED BECAUSE THEYARE TRAVELLING BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT DIVEN DECKS THEYARE PERHAPS SLEEPIN ON MONE DECK TRAVELLING UP THE NEXT DECK TO EAT FOOD ANOVHER DECK FOR EXERCISE IND THE TOP DECK IS ALWAYS EXERCISE CHUDDE COULDN'T HAVE CLOSED HER CREW WORDFIGHT DOOS SO ANY OF THOSE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONEO THE BIGGEST DISASTERS WYO WOULD FIND WHAT WAS IT LIKE SEEING THE SHIP WAS TO QUEEN MARY THE QUEEN ELIZABETH THE SALING ON DID YOU HAVE ANY FRIDY WITH ANY BITI SHIPS THAT YOU KNEW OF AND WERE PROUD OF ANYWHERE WELL UAN ALL ALL WE REALLY KNEW WAS THAT WE WAS GOING TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS OR BRING ONE O THE MONSTERS IN ORT OT IF IT WAS THE QUEEN MARY AND WE WERE IN GREENOCK THEN WE WOULD KNOW IS THE GREEN THE COMIN WHERE WE WERE TAKEN OUT AND THAT'S ALWAYS GOT THREE FUNNELS ANYWAY IF WE PICKED UP IF HE'S GOT THREE FUNNELS ITS T QUEEN MARY AE'S GOT TWO FUNNELS IT'S QUEEN ELIZABETH AND SO ON YOUOT FORM A FOUR FUNNELS WITH TE ACQUITANIA AND SO IT WENT ON BUT YOU WERE NEVER TOLD YOU WERE JUST SAIL OUT AND AN GO TO A RENDEVOUS WHERE YOUUD WAIT AROUND OR YOU'VE ALREADY CONTACTED THAT SHIP TO SAY YOU'RE THERE AND YOU'D BRING IT IN VERY OFTEN EVEN WE TWO RESCORTS ONE WOULD BE AT GREENOK AT THE CLIDE AND THE OTHER BE DOWN AT LIVERPOOL AND WE WOULD REACH A POINT OF RENDEZVOUS GOING OUT O THE CLIDE AND THE OTHER ONE THE CAVALIER PERHAPS COME OUT A LIVERPOOL AND THEN WE'D STEAM UP TOGETHER TO THE M A RENDEVOOU POINT FOR THE MTHE MONSTER TID THIS HAPPEND ALMOST ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK FOR A MON OR OTOEUS WE NEVER HAD THE SAME COHART AN BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T ALWAYS BE IN THE SAME AREA THEY'D BE DOING SOMETHING ELSE AND BETWEEN THAT IF YOU'R DUTY SHIP IF AM THERE AS AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER WHICH HAPPENED IN ONE CASE AM HAD BEEN TORPEDOD WE HAD JUST COME DOWN FROM SCAPPER TO A TO GREENOCK AND WE AD JUST ARRIVED AT THE HARBOUR ENTRANCE WE WENT STRAIGHT TO AN OILER BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO FILL UP WITH OIL BECAUSE YE MIGHT HAVE TO GO OUT AND JUST AS WE WAS AT THE OILER WE GOT AN EMERGENCY CALL TO SAY THAT OME AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER HAD BEEN TORPEDOD JUST OUT IN THE AM A CLIDE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CLIDE SO WE A JUST LET GO FROM THE OILER AND WE WENT STRAIGHT OUT TO A TO THETHE THING IT WAS AT ER AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND STRANGELY ENOUGH SHE WAS ON HER OWN SHE HAD COME FROM LONDERRY SHEAD HAD NO ESCORT AND LUCKILY SHE DIDN'T HAVE A FULL COMPLIMENT OF A OF SEAMAN AND SO FORTH AND SHE WAS COME INTO AM TO THE CLIDE I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THEY TORPEDED THAT THE TORPEDOD AM A MERCHANT SHIP AT THE SAME TIME AND THE NEW BOAT GOT AWAY ALTHOUGH WE WENT TO ATTACK IT IT WAS DARK AND E WE LEFT THE OTHERS I THINK LOOKING FOR THE YEW BOAT AFTEARDS WHERE WE CAME CAME BACK INTO HARBOUR O HOW LONG ARE YOU AT SEA WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN THE ATLANTIC HOHOW OFTEN YOU GOING BACK TO BAS AND GETTING IT LANDLEV IN A DESTROY NOT VERY LONG BECAUSE YOU O HAVEN'T GOT THAT MUCH FUL AND TE YOWAYS USING YOUR STOP SPEED ALWAYS MANOEUVERING YOUR ONLY WAY OF GETTING FUEL IF YOU'RE OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS FOR FROM ONE OF THE BIGGER SHIPS EITHER FROM AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER OR SOMETHING AS BIG AS A BELFAST AR CRUISER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND ALSO FOOD YOUR FOOD RUNS OUT AFTER A SHORT WHILE SO THE ONLY TIME WERE REALLY OUT FOR A LONG TIME IS AM WHEN WE'S UP AT SCAPPER WHEN WE AM WORKING UP WHEN WE'S GOING OUT ON HEM FORAYS TO A TO HELP TO SINK IN THE TIP TURPETS OR DOIN OTHER JOBS A MOST OF THE OTHERS IT WAS A CASE OF GOING OUT JUST FOR A DAY OR TWO TO PICK UP ONE OF THE MONSTERS AND THEN COME BACK WITH THE MONSTER OR TAKE ONE OUT AND LEAVE IT IN WHICH CASE WE'D HAVE TO GO TO LONDON DERRY PERHAPS AND THEN WE COME OUT O LONDON DERRY AGAIN AND NO GO OUT ON THAT SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT RESPECT THAT A NO WE WERE NOT OUT FOR VERY LONG THERE 'S ONLY ON ONE OCCASION WHEN WE WAS OUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME IT MUST AVE BEEN OVER TO FIVE DAYS I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT THE OCCASION WAS BUT WE HAD UN OUT O FOOD AND WE WAS FURTHER UP IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC AND OUR CAPTAIN WAS A EX FISHERY FLEET MAN HE HAD HIS OWN FISHERY FLEET TEN SO WHAT HE DECIDED TO DO AS WE RUN OUT O FOOD HE SAID I KNOW WHERE THE FISH UM ARE SO HE GUIDED THE SHIP UP TO WHERE HE KNEW THEY WERE PICKED UP A SHOVL ON THE RAEDAR ON THE ASDEK DROPPED AT TESEPSIDE LOWERED THE BOAT PICKED UP ALL HO THE FISH THAT CAME UP THE STUNED HE STOOD ON THE FOLKSHOL WE SAW HIM SETTLE IN THE FOLKSAL AND SAID UP MY MIND PICKED THE PIGERS ONE WE LIVED ON FISH FOR A FEW MORE DAYS AFTER THAT SO ONE VERY GOOD BUT OUR RUNS WERE MOSTLY AND JUST ABOUT FIVE DAYS AT A TIME BUT THAT MEANT THAT EVERY TIME WE CAME IN TO THE E E EITHER SCAPPER OR IF WE WERE IN LIVERPOOL OR TO THEDECLIDE WE HAD TO ALWAYS HAD PLENTY OF FUEL ON BOARD BECAUSE IF YOURE DEAFOE AA DUTY DESTROYER AND THEN IF SOMETHING COMES UP WHERE SHIP'S BEEN SUNK WO HAVE TO GO OUT STRAIGHT AWAY AND YOU MIGHT BE OUT FOR A LONG TIME LOOKING FOR A SUBMARINE OR MORTAN ON SUBMARINE SO WE WERE LUCKY IN THE FACT THAT A WE NEVER WENT OUT FOR A LONG TIME OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AL IN AT SEA WHICH IS A DANGEROUS PRACTICE ANYWAY AND A PICKIN UP FOOD AND EVERYTHING PRO FROM IT CAN YOU DESCRIBE RAGA YES AND ISI TE JOBE WID E RAD IT YES VERY YO YO DO BUT FIRST OF ALL WHEN I WAS ON THE RAD O SET IT'S ONLY A SMALL SHET AND A IT THEY'RE DIFFERENT TYPES AT THE TWO NINE THREE THAT IS HIGH UP ON THE MAS AND AT SPECIALLY FOR PICKING UP AN AIRCRAFT OR SURFACE SHIPS REALLY ANY ANY DISTANCT I CAN CAN'T THINK OF THE RA RANGE RANGE OF IT BUT IT SENDS OUT A SIGNAL FROM THERE WHICH OF COURSE IF IT DOESN'T HIT ANYTHING YOU DON'T GET IT BACK BUT IF IT HITS ANYTHING EVEN CLIFFS OR AN AIRCRAFT OR SURFICE SHIP THEN IT BAANCES BACK AND ON THE SCREEN IEW AM WHICH IS A A ROUND SCREEN UNDER THE A THE CURSER IS GOING ROUND ALL THE TIME THAT WILL SHOW A BLIP AND THAT BLIP YOUL HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S OM A CLOUD WHICH IT MIGHT BE BECAUSE DEPEND ON YOUR RADAR WHAT IT'S DOING A VERTICAL OR ANGULAR AND YOU WILL THEN READ OFF THE DISTANCE AND E ANGLE OF EVERYTHING IF THIS IS MOSTLY ON ON A LEVEL BUT YOU HAVE ANOTHER SCREAM WHICH GIVES YOU THE HEIGHT OF AN AIRCRAFT SO YOU USE ONE WITH THE OTHER THAT THAAN WHEN AT ASIGNAL ELECTRONIC SIGNAL HITS ANYTHING THEN IT RETURNS AND THEN YOU YOU READ OFF THE DISTANCE OF IT BUT IEAS IT'S I NOT IT'S EASYER TO USE AND WHER WE FIND A DIFFICULTY IS BY EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW VERY OFTEN WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT EITHER LAND BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF IT ON THERE OR IF IT'S A SMALL BLIP THEN ITS IS AN AIRCRAFT A SHIP OR WHATEVER IF IF YOU KNOW YOU'R USING ONE TYPE OF RODAR IT'S ONLY AM ONLY HORIZONTAL IF YOU USEN ANOTHER ONE IT CAN BE HORIZONTAL OR AN AIRCRAFT AND IT WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD DISTANCE THE TIME IT TAKES OF COURSE IT'S BASED ON IF IT TAKES TEN SECONDS GET FROM THERE TO THERE THEN THI'S AAND YOU READ IT OFF FROM THE SQUEEN LUCKILY AT OUR POINT IN THE WAR WE NEVER HAD ANY TROUBLE WITH AIRCRAFT THE ONLY TIME WE WOULD HAVE HAD PROBLAMS WITH THAT IS IF THE TORPEDO BOMMERS HAD BEEN SENT AFTER US OFF NORWAY THEN WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO USE THAT AND THEN WE WOULD KNOW THETHE AM WE'D HAVE TO USE THE TWO RADORSETS THEN THE ONE THACH GIVES YOU A SIGNAL IT THE HEIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT ND THE OTHER ONE WHICH GIVES YOU DISTANCE OF IT AND THEN YOU'RE TRAINED TO KNOW WHICH A I THE DIFFERENCE AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT AS FAR AS I REMEMBER IF IT WAS ONE OF OUR OWN AIRCRAFT IT WOULD HAVE AN IDENTIFICATION SIGNAL WHICH YOU WOULD KNOW ON YOUR RADOR SET BEFORE IT I GOT TOYOU SO YOU YOU'LD HAVE TO HAV PRETTY WELL EXPERIENCED BUT MY TIME WUS NOT ALWAYS ON A RAD I SAT YOU WEARE SOMETIMES ON LOOKOUT AS A SEAMAN WHERE YOU'RE SITTING UP IN A LOOKOUT BOX ON THE STARBARD SIDE WAT MINE AND YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR AIRCRAFT WHICH WAS NOT VERY OFTEN BESORE AM SURFACE SHIPS OR MORE THAN LIKELY YOU'RE LOOKING OUT FOR A LITTLE TINY PEROSCOPE WHICH IS VERY HARD TO SEE IN A ROUGHER ATLANTIC OR YOU MIGHT BE UNLUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE THE TRACK OF A TORPEDO COMING TOWARD YOU IN WHICH CASE YOU GET INTO A PANIC AND A CALL OUT QUICKLY TO THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE AN THE PEOPLE ON THE BRIDGE AND THE CAPTAIN OR AN OFFICER OR THE OF THE WATCH AT THE TIME IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN OPEN BRIDGE NOWADAYS IT'S ENCLOSED BUTE I'S AN OPEN BRIDGE SO THE BRIDGE IS HERE YOU GOT A LOOKOUT POSITON JUST ERE SO YOU JUST CALL OUT TO THAT PERSON ON THE BRIDGE OFFICER SHIP BEARING RED FIVE O GREEN FIVA WHEVER YOUR POSITION IS ANGLE OF SIGHT IF IT'S AN AIRCRAFT AND OU'D IMMEDIATELY A LOOK AT IT AND DECIDE WHAT ACTION TO TAKE BUT IF YOU'RE ON THAT LOOKOUT POSITION WHICH I WAS ON QUITE A LOT AS A SEAMAN IT'S ROUGH CAUSE AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN ALL THE TIME BEEIN A DESTROYER YOU ALMOST A SUBMARINE AT TIMES THE WHOLE OF THE SEA COMPS UP OVER YOU AND YOU GET KNOCKED BACK AGAINST THE SEARCH LIGHT AND IT IS VERY DAMP THAT IS VERY ROUGH UNCOMFORTABLE BUT AND THIS IS WHAT YOU GET USED TO YOU USED TO WEAR AN ESPECIAL SUIT WHICH COVERD YOU COMPLETELY WATERFUR SUIT WITH CAPE UP BARNING AND BUT EVEN EVEN THAT THE WATER GOT ALL THE WAY DOWN AN YOU GOT SOAKIN WET I REMEMBER COMING OFF WATCH ON MON OCCASION LIKE THIS CAUSE NORMALLY YOU HAVE TO CLIMB BACK DOWN ON THE OUTSIDE LADDERS OF THE SHIP BECAUSE THE THE DOORS THAT YOU WOULD GO IN AND OUT IN PORT WERE OPEN WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA THOSE DOORS WILL BE CLOSED BECAUSE THE WATER COMES IN THOSE SO YOU HAVE TO CLIMB DOWN LADDERS DOWN THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHIP NOT NOT OUTSIDE IN THE SEA BUT CLIMB DOWN FROM THE TOP DECK TO THE VARDEC AND IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL THE WAVE IN IT HITS YOU YOU CAN GET WASHED AWAY SOYO HOLD ON VERY TIGHT WELL THIS WAS THE MIDDLE WATCH THAT I CAN RECALL WHICH IS FROM TWELVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MON FOR TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BUT YOU'RE NOT ON WATCH ELOOK OUT ALL THAT TIME OF THE FOR OUR WATCH YOU DO DIFFERENT JOBS HALF OUN ON LOOKOUT HALF HOUR PERHAPS ON THE ROD AR SET ALF OUR ONE HALF HOUR BEHIND A GUN WHERE THERE'S A GOT YOU BECOME PART OF THE GUN CREW SO IF YOU DID HAVE TO GO INTO ACTION YOU WOULD DO THE SHOOTIN WHILE THE REAL GONG CREW IS CALLED UP TO TAKE OVER FROM YOU WELL ON THIS OCCASION IT HAD BEEN VERY WET OUTSIDE I'D GOT SO KIN AND TIRED O SAY MIDDLE WATCH PROBABLY ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK I'D COME DOWN SO WENT DOWN TO MY MESS DECK WHICH AS IN THE FOLKSAL ITS A ROUGH PART OF THE SHIP I HADN'T SLUG MY HAMMOCK I'D SLEPT ON TE AH CUSHIONS N THIS TIME ID I DIDN'T FANCY SIT SLEEPING ON THE CUSHIONS CAUSE THE SHIP WAS GOING SO MUCH THIS WAY AND I KNEW ID COME OFF THE CUSHIONS SO I GOT DOWN UNDER THE MESS TABLE THERE'S ABOUT THAT MUCH WATER ON THE FLOOR THE DECK SORRY NOT THE FLOOR ON THE DECK ABOUT THAT MUCH SO I GOT ME COAT O MIDE THIS SUIT SUIT AS YOUR CALLD IT AND EVERYTHING AND I'M LAYING DOWN NOW OFF TO SLEEP STRAIGHTAWAY A NEXT THING I KNOW A FOOT AD TOUCH ME AND I OPENED MY BLEARY EYES AND THERE WAS THE OFFICER OF THE WATCH AND THE LEADIN SHEAMAN OF THE MESS AND HE WAS SAYING TO ME I'M TOLD THIS IN THE MORNING BY THE LEADING HAND OF THE MESS EHE SAID THE OFFICER SAID TO YOU COME ON SEMAN YOU CAN'T SLEEP UNDER THERE I'S TOO WET AND I SAID AND HE LOOKED AT THE LEADIN HAND AND SAID WHAT DID HE SAY AND THE NAMES ME DO KNO I DON'T READ THAT LANGUAGE AND SO OH WELL WE'D BETTER LEV T LET HIM SLEEP THERE AND HE LEFT MEU THERE NOTHING WAS SAID ABOUT IT THOUGH WELL YOUAT YOU'RE LYING IN THAT MUCH WATER THE THE DECKS OF THE SHIPS WERE INSIDE NOW INSIDE YOUR MESS DECK THE WATER JUST IT'S A ONE TEMPERATURE OUTSIDE AND A LITTLE BIT WARMER INSIDE SO YOU GET ALL HUMIDITY ALL THE WATER RUNS DOWN THE INSIDE OF THE DECKS ANY TIME YOU'RE ON THE CAVALIER YOU T YOU' HAVE A LOOK ANDTHE INSIDE OF BECAUSE YOUR METAL WORK AT THE SHIP'S SIDE IS ONLY ABOUT EIGHTH OF AN INCH NO THICKER THAN THAT AND AM SO THERE THEY AWAS YOU GOT WATER MOST THE TIME WEN YO'RE ON TE ON THE MASDECKS WHEN YOU'RE AT SEA AND YEU'RE IN HARBER YOU'RE NOT TOO BAD SO IT GETS A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE THERE WAS ANOTHER TIME WHEN WE WORKED WITH TE QUEEN MARY AND WE HAD TO PICK HER UP TO BRING HER IMN WE WENT OUT AN ITS INMONONE OF THE ROUGHEST STORMS TO AT WE HAD ABOUT THREE REALLY ROUGH STORMS IN THE PERIOD THAT WE WEREROKING IN THE ATLANTIC AND WHAT WE HAD TO AT THIS TIME HAD BE ABOUT MARCH NINTY FORTY FIVE ERWE HAD TO GO AND PICK UP THE QUEEN MARY NOW THAT THE STORM HAD BEEN RAGING ALL THE WAY FROM AMERICA AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE THATHE BIGSTOB TA HAD COME ACROSS OUR WAY AND THE QUEEN MARY BROUGHT IT WITH AR SORT OF THING AND WE PICKED HER UP AND A I THINK WEERE A DAY OR MORE WAITING TO PICK HER UP BECAUSE EVEN SHE HAD BEEN HELD UP BY THE BAD STORMS WELL WE AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAS THE SISTERSHIP AT THAT TIME BUT WE GOT REALLY BENT UP WE LOST ON A MOATER BOAT WE LOST AM ONE OF THE M WHAILERS A AND WE GOT REALLY KNOCKED ABOUT AND WHEN WE GOT MTOWARDS THE CLIDE THE QUEEN TO QUEEN MARY KNOWING THAT IT WAS IN THE AREA THAT THERE WOULD BE YO BOATS WE HAD TO RELY ON HER SPEECH THAT COULD BEBIT SO AS AS WE A GOT WITHIN HAILING DISTANCE I SUPOSE YO O SA OF THE OTHE CLIDE AND THE QUEEN MARY DECIDED SHE COULDN'T SLOW DOWN TO KEEP UP WITH US CAUSE IT WAS TOO ROUGH FOR US WE WOULD HAVE BEEN TURNED OVER AND SO SHE JUST FLASHED THE MESSAGE SHE YOU IN TE CLID TETAR AND SHE KEPT UP HER SPEED AND GOT INTO THE GLIDE NOW SHE HAD THE WHOLE OF THE FRONT OF HER BRIDGE STOVED IN AND TS A BIG SHIP WELL UP IN THE AIR THEY HAD A LOT OF CASUALTIES BECAUSE THEYRE CARRIIEND ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND O TROOPS AND UM THIS WAS NOW LATE AT NIGHT I THINK ABOUT AN ELAVE ELEVENT O'CLOCK AT TWELVE O'CLOCK AT NIGHT BUT ANYWAY SHE GOT INTO THE CLIDE WITH WITHOUT ANYTHING BUT DAMAGE FROM FROM THE SEA WE LIMPT IN LATER ON NOW IN THE CLIDE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO UM ANCHOR AND WE COULDN'T GO FURTHER IN TO GRENOCK TO GREENOK BECAUSE AFTER THAT YOU GO THROUGH THE BOOM AND THE BOOM IS CLOSED AT NIGHT UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESCESSARY TO OPEN THE BOOM WHICH PREVENTS OR ELPSE TO PREVENT AN YE BOATS GETTIN AT THAT POINT SO AT THE OTHER SIDE WHERE WE HAD TO UM TIE UP TO A BOY WE HAVE TWO BOY JUMPERS TO TY UP TO A BOY YOU HAVE TO STOP AND YOU HAVE TO LOWER YOUR WALER WITH THE BOY JUMPER AND THE RUBBERS IN IT TO TAKE YOU TO THE BOY WITH THE CHAIN TO CLIP IT TO THE BOY WELL IF I'VE GIVEN YOU A PICTURE OF HOW ROUGH THE STORM WAS IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THAT FIRST WALER WE WE AM AND LET DOWN ON TO THE WATER MANAGED TO GET DOWN SAFELY BUT GOT WASHED AWAY WITH A CREW IN IT FURTHER DOWN THE CLIDE THAT WAS A WAY FOR ABOUT THREE OR FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO LOWER ANOTHER WHALER ALL OF US WAS UP ON THE FOLKSHOR E KNOW A ALL THE SEAMEN THAT COULD HELP WAS UP ON THE FOLKSHORE AND A CAUSE YOU CAN'T USE YOUR ANCHOR YOU JUST YUSE AN ANCHOR CHAIN WHICH GOES WITH A A WRE ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE ANCHOR CHAIN AND THE WHALER HAS TO TAKE THIS WIRE TO THE BOY TO CLAMP IT ON TO THE BOY AND THEN THE BOY IS PULLED BY THE ANCHOR CHAIN NEARER THE SHIP SO THAT THEY CLIP IT ON SO ANYWAY THEY LOWERED THE SECOND WHALER THE BOY CUMPER MANAGED TO GET ON TO THE BOY AND INDOINSO BROKE HIS WRIST AND E IN THE END AFTER I THINK IT WAS ABOUT FOUR HOURS WE MANAGED TO CLIP UP TO THE BOY AND AN THE E CAPTAIN SAID TOPS ALL ROUND A I HATED A SMELL OF RUM ANYWAY AND NEVER WOULD HAVE HAD LETOT CAUSE IT'S HORRIBLE BUTA WE I HAD IT THAT NIGHT BECAUSE WE WERE FROZEN FROZEN STIFF AND A WE LANDES TO GET AWAY WITH IT BUT NOTHING WAS EVER SAID ABOUT THIS TYP O THING BECAUSE ALTHOUGH OUR PEOPLE AT THE PORKS KNEW THESE BIG SHIPS COME COME IN AND IT WAS NOT E A THING THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT BECAUSE THE GERMANS ALSO KNEW THAT THEY WERE BRINGING THE ODES LARGE NUMBERS BETWEEN A TEN AND FIFTEEN THOUSAND TROOPS THIT COULD CARRY AND AN ANY OF THE EWBOAT CAPTAINS I UNDERSTAND AN THISUS NORMAL KNOWLEDGE WERE OFFERED A LARGE SUM OF MONEY THOUSANDS OF WHAT THEY SSALUBO JOSEMARK DOSMARK THOUSAND DOLLARS BACK AND THE HIGHEST OF THE BAT OF HONOURS TO HAVE KNOCKED DOWN ANY ONE OF THESE MONSTERS BUT A WE NEVER LOST ONE FORTUNATELY I A BE TO SAY BUT THE QUEEN MARY AND WAS REALLY BATTERED VERY BADLY BATTERED HOW WE DIDN'T GET TURNED OVER I GOT NO IDEA WEN YOU TALKING ABOUT BIG SEASE WAT SULICIDE YOU TOK WELL IS IF YOUR A THE DESEISE ITSELF YOU'RE TALDI THAT WELL AND THERE IS IS GENERALLY KNOWN THAT SOME OF THE WAVES WERE SIXTY FOOT HIGH NOW IF YOU THINK OF SIXTY FOOT GOING UP THAT WAY WHEN YOU GO UP TO THE WAVE AND YOU COME DOWN TO THE TROUGH YOUE GOT A HUNDRED AN TWENTY FOOT AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN CUT THROUGH THOSE WAVES AND THE BIG SHIPS OR THE SMALL SHIPS YOU ACTALLY GO UP ON THAT WAVE AND THEN YOU FEEL IT DID YOU COME DOWN WITH A CRUNCH LIKE THAT AND THEN YOUGO UP TO E NEXT ONE AND ALL THE TINE YOU'R COLK SCREWIN YOU KNOW YOYOU'RE NOT STILL AND YOU GET USED TO THIS AFTER THAT FIRST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE YOU'E GOT ROED ALL OVER THE PLACE BECAUSE YOU YOU GO THROUGH A NORMAL AM CORRIK FLATS THEY'RE CALLED ON THE DESTROYER THE NORMAL CORRIDOR ON THE FLOOR ON A FLITAN DESTROYER BRIGIT ABOUT THAT WIDE WELL WHEN YOU FIRST GO ABOARD ONE LIKE THAT AND IT WAS FAIRLY CALM WHEN WYEU SET OUT FOR SCAPPER FROM GREEOCK BUT AS YOU WALK ALONG THE DECK COMES UP TO MEET YOU AS IT GOS UP AND YOU HIT YOUR FEET AS YOU GO DOWN ON THE DECK BUT BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THAT DECK HAS GONE AWAY AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN AND THIS HITS YOU FROM THE TOP AND THEN WILE THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU'RE DOIN THIS THIS BULKET HITS YOU NEX YOU KNOW THAT BALKET HITS YOU SO IN TIME YOU LEARNED TO WALK LIKE A SAILOR AN AS THE SHIP GOES DOWN YOU GO DOWN WITH IT AND COME UP WITH IT AND THAT'S WH YOU'LL FIND SAILORS ADWHEN YE GET ASHORE THEY WORK WITH A ROLL WALK WITH A ROLL THAT IS JUST THAT HEYRE STILL WALKING ON THE SHIP SO AFTER THE END OF THE WAR NI EDAY NIYOUL AR FINISHED YE ON VIDA ITSELF WE WERE AN AS THAS THE NINTH OF MAY WE WERE BRINGING IN THE OLDER FRANCS AND WWE GOT NOTICE THAT THE PEACE AND HAD BEEN DECLARED FOR TE NEXT DAY AND WEE GOMING INTO GRO INTO GREENOCK SO WE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN THE LAST OF THE WONSHIP CONVOYS BEFORE THE WAR ENDED SO WE ARRIVED IN GREENOCK I BELIEVE IT S HORDOR WEDNSDAY OR SUNDAY AND HALF THE SHIP'S COMPANY WAS ALLOWED LEAVE WHICH WASN'T ME IM AFRAD I WASN'T ONE OF THE SHIP'S COMPANY BUT THEY WENT ASHORE TO TO GREENOCK AND HAD A GOOD TURN NO TIME SO THEN WE STILL CARRIED ON WITH SOME OF THESE CONVOYS AFTER THERE BECAUSE SOM THERE WAS QUITE A FEW OF THE YEW BOATS THAT APPARENTLY MISSING AND LOT THEM AND ONE OR TWO WENT TO A BRAZIL OR WHATEVER SO THERE WAS A SU STILL A CHANCE THAT IF THERE WAS A ROPE ROBE YEUBOAT AROUND AY COULD HAVE KNOCKED DOWN SOME OF THE AM MONSTERS WE WERE SURET BRING HIM BACK IN BUT WE HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL BUT TO CUT A LONG STORY SHORT ANYWAY AND WE WERE THEN DESTINED TO GO ACROSS TO AM THE END TRY TO END THE JAPANESE WAR SO TWO BY TWO OUR FLOTILLA WENT IN FOR REFITS WE WE WENT IN FOR A REFIT LATE IN MAY AND JUNE AND BECAUSE WE WERE GOING OUT THERE ANYWAY BUT FORTUNATELY WHILE I I WAS ON AND LEAVE TO GO OUT THERE THE SHIP WAS DOWN AT AN DEVONPORT BEING REFITTED THE WAR ENDED SO I TOOK UP A TELEGRAM TO SAY DAY LEAVE EXTRA THAY LEAVE EXTAR WHEN WE CAME BACK TO THE SHRIP WE STILL HAD TO GO OUT THERE BECAUSE WE WERE HAVING TO CLEAR UP AFTER THE WAR WELL AND THE WHOLE OF OUR FLOTILLA WE'RE OUT THERE THEN WE WERE THE LAST TWO SO AS WE READ OUT GIBRALTAR MATA ADEN AND PLACER LIKE THAT WE VER THOUGHT WE WAS INVER A LOVELY SUMMAG CRUISE BUT THEN WHEN WE GOT TO SINGPOR NO WHEN WE GOT TO TRINCAMALE THAT WAS OUR NAVAL BASE WE BASED AT TRINCOMALE AND WEALSO BASED AT SINGAPOR OR WHEN WE GOT TO SINGAPOR AND THIS WAS JUST ABOUT A WEEK OR TWO AFTER THES WAR AND A WE WERE CARRING OUT AN EXERCISE WITH A ATIMIS SUSSEX AN ANOTHER SHIP AND A THE CAPTAIN THE FLIDA THE FLUTILLA LEADER WHO WAS ON ATIMUS CESA AND A OURSELVES IN CAVALIER WERE ORDERED TO GO WITH THE SUSSEX TO AN A PROBLEM SO WE IMMEDIATELY WENT AT FULL SPEED WE WERE SENT TO A TO JARVA WE STOPPED ON A A COUPLE OF TROOP SHIPS ON THE WAY I CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH ABOUT THAT LITTLE BIT BUT WE TOOK ON BOARD OUR FO OUR FULL DECK WAS COVERED WITH INDIAN TROOPS ARMED INDIAN TROOPS AND THE CAVALIER WIS THE SAME AND THE CAESAR WAS ALSO AND THE SUSSAXS ANCHORED OUTSIDE SIRABAACAUSE IT COULDN'T GET IN WE COULD HARDLY GET IN CAUSE THERE WAS A A SUNKEN A JAPANESE CRUISER IN THERE IN THE WAY SO CESAR WENT IN FIRST CAUSE SHE WAS FLED TO LHE LEADER FULL OF TROOPS WE WENT IN SECONDS AS WE WERE SECOND AND THEN THE CAVALIER AFTER US AS WE WENT IN IT WAS DAYLIGHT WE HAD ALL ER TROOPS ON BOARD SO IF WED HAD ANY TROUBLE WE COULDN'T AVE USED OUR GUNS BECAUSE OF
