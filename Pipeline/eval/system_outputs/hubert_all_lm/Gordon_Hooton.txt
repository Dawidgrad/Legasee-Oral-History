ANOTHER CHAP SAT WITH ME WE BOTH PASSED OUT AND AND WENT INTO JOBS IN THE DOCKYARD BASICALLY UNTIL WE GOT A SHIP IS THIS THAT CHATHAM NO THIS IS ER YEAH CHATHAM SORRY I'M GETTING MIXED UP AND AS SOON AS THAT HAPPENED WE WE ER MESSED ABOUT A LITTLE BIT IN THE DOCKYARD DOING WORK AND THAT AND THEN THE SAVAGE SHE WAS DOWN ON THE ER ALL THE TROUBLE WERE DOWN SOUTH SHE CAME FLYING BACK BECAUSE SHE WAS DESPERATELY NEEDED GOING UP TO THE MURMANSK RUN AND ME AND THE CHAP WERE IN THERE WE WENT ABOARD AND GOT PICKED UP AND UP TO SCAPA FLOW AND THAT WAS IT AND OF COURSE WE DOING IT ON THE RUNS ONE AFTER THE OTHER UP THERE WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF THE CHATHAM DOCKYARD WHAT WAS IT LIKE AS A PLACE FOR A YOUNG BOY WELL I MEAN I WAS A YOUNG BOY AND I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS WONDERFUL I HAD TO SERVE I MEAN I ACTUALLY THE FIRST THING I DID BECAUSE THE SAVAGE HADN'T COME UP THEN SHE WAS JUST FINISHING DOWN AT WHERE THE BATTLE WAS GOING ON AND I WAS PUT THEY SENT ME IN THE DOCKYARD TO DO A JOB UNTIL THE SHIP COME UP YOU SEE AND I WAS IN THAT SUBMARINE HAD TO GO IN THAT SUBMARINE WHICH WAS IN DRY DOCK THAT HAD FOOLED THE GERMANS AND THE SPANIARDS WHEN THEY PUT THAT DEAD BODY OVER IN THE CHANNEL BETWEEN THEM DO YOU REMEMBER IT WELL THEY FOOLED THE GERMANS THAT IT WAS A GERMAN THAT WAS THEY ACTUALLY PUT A BODY THEY GOT A DEAD MAN'S BODY A GENUINE DEAD MAN'S BODY FROM NORTH AND THEY PUT IT INTO THIS SUBMARINE AND THEY ACTUALLY DRESSED IT ALL UP HE WAS A MAN TRYING TO TAKE INFORMATION TO THE SPANIARDS YOU KNOW THE COASTLINE AND THEY SUNK IT THEY TOOK THIS DEAD BODY AND A ONE AND DONE IT ALL MADE IT ALL LOOK SMART IN A UNIFORM NIGHT SERVICE UNIFORM IN CLOTHING AND A AND THEY PUT A THING ON HIS ARM WITH GREAT BIG ATTACHE CASE WITH A DUMMY INFORMATION WHAT WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A GERMAN SPY YOU SEE BUT YOU SHOULD IF I COME IT'S A FILM IT'S FANTASTIC ANYWAY THAT LITTLE SUBMARINE THAT I HAD TO GO AND WORK ON HAD JUST COME BACK FROM TAKING THE BODY AND FLOATING IT IN BETWEEN THE SPANISH COAST LIKE ASHORE AND DRESSED HIM ALL UP AS ONE OF THEIR SORT IT WAS YOU KNOW AND IT ALL WORKED WHAT WAS IT LIKE GOING TO THE SAVAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN YOU WERE YOU KNOW YOUR FIRST PROPER DRAFT DO YOU REMEMBER WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS SHE WAS DOWN ON THE BATTLEFRONT AND SHE WAS CALLED AWAY BECAUSE SHE WAS NEEDED FOR THIS AND WE WERE DONE OR TORPEDO COURSE AND WE WERE HAVING TO WORK IN THE DOCKYARD IN THE DAYTIME AND THEN IT IN THE IN THE CANTEENS AT NIGHT AND ANYWAY WE GOT PIPE FOR AND WE BOTH GOT TOLD TO GET A IT ALREADY AND TAKE HER IN THE DOCKYARD AND THE SAVAGE CAME IN FROM BEING DOWN ON THE BANK WHERE THEY WERE FIGHTING AND SHE'D BEEN PULLED RIGHT UP AND THEY WAS LOADING HER UP WITH STUFF AND THAT ALONGSIDE AND WE GOT CALLED AND PUT ABOARD HER AND WE WERE THAT'S AS QUICK AS THAT BUT I'LL TELL YOU THE BLOKE THAT WAS WITH ME HE DIED NOT ABOVE THREE WEEKS AGO AND WE BOTH TOGETHER YOU SEE WE BOTH TOOK THE COURSE TOGETHER AND EVERYTHING AND WE STICK TOGETHER AND WE BOTH GOT PUT ONTO THE SAVAGE SHE CAME IN IN THE AFTERNOON AND PULLED ALONGSIDE AND GOD IT WAS MURDER THEY WERE HAVING TO DO ALL SORTS OF THINGS BECAUSE WE GOT A RACE UP WITH THIS BIG CONVOY THAT WAS COMING FROM CANADA ALREADY THERE WAS LOADS UP IN NORTH SCOTLAND WAITING FOR THE CONVOY TO MOVE ON AND THIS IS HOW WE KNEW IT ANYWAY THEY PIPE FOR US TO AND WE WENT ON TO THE ER WINDOW WHERE THEY TELL YOU WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND THEY SENT US STRAIGHT TO THE SAVAGE IN THE DOCKYARD AND WHAT THE SAVAGE WAS HAVING TO DO WAS TAKE ON AMMUNITION AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND IT WAS POURING OF BLOODY RAIN THAT NIGHT IT BUCKETED DOWN AND WE HAD TO GO DOWN FURTHER DOWN THE COAST BECAUSE WE JOINED IT ONCE WE WENT ON WE WERE THERE FOREVER YOU SEE WE'D BEEN DRAFTED TO HER WHICH WAS ALL RIGHT BUT WE WENT DOWN TO ERM WHEN IT GOT DARK WE WENT DOWN TO THE AMMUNITION PLACE WHICH WAS A LONG WAY DOWN WATER FROM US ONLY IT WAS BOCKETING DOWN AND GUIDE BLIND WE HAD AMMUNITION SHIP IN IN THE DARK AND IT AS YOU WENT ALONG THE DIRTY PIPE NOT PIPES BOARDS AND THEY WERE SPRINGING UP AND DOWN CARRYING STUFF OUT AND POURING RAIN AND PITCH BLACK AND THE SHIP WAS SHIPPING WATER IT WAS RAINING SO HARD WE WERE ALL CARRYING STUFF UP ALONG THE LANDING IT YOU KNOW TO FILL HER UP WITH AMMUNITION AND THAT AND WE SAILED FROM THERE AT MIDNIGHT THROUGH BETWEEN IRELAND AND THAT TO JOIN THIS BIG CONVOY YOU NEVER SEE IT RAIN LIKE IT GOD ALMIGHTY AND I WAS A LOOKOUT AND MY MATE WAS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE IN A LOOKOUT IT WAS BLOODY SOAKED TO THE SKIN PITCH BLACK OF COURSE WE HAD TO PUT ALL NEW AMMUNITION ON AND BEFORE WE COULD SAIL FROM THERE BECAUSE THAT WERE THE AMMUNITION BUNKERS DOWN THERE ANYWAY WE GOT UP IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING WE REACHED LIVERPOOL AND THAT AREA AND THEN IT SOUNDED LIGHTING UP A BIT BUT NEVER LEFT OFF DRIVING RAIN AND WE WENT RIGHT THE WAY UP TO THE NORTH WHERE WE GOT TO PICK THIS CONVOY UP AND THEY WERE ALL MORE OR LESS READY TO SAIL IT WAS THE BIGGEST CONVOY OF THE WAR AND EVERY TYPE OF SHIP WAS THERE AND OF COURSE WE JOINED HER I MEAN I'D NEVER BEEN THE BLOODY SEA YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE BECAUSE WE HADN'T BEEN TRAINED FOR IT IT WAS TOO QUICK BUT ANYWAY WE MANAGED MY MATE FIRST THING YOU WERE ALL MIXED UP BECAUSE THE SHIP WAS SHIP IN WATER ALL THE WAY UP AND I WENT DOWN INTO THE FRONT OF THE SHIP AND IT WAS HALF FULL OF BLOODY WATER AND IT KEPT SWINGING FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER IT WAS SHIPPING IT OVER THE TOP YOU SEE IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST STORMS OF THE WAR RUNNING UP THAT COAST AND BUT ANYWAY I I DON'T MIND ADMITTING IT I FELT SO BLOODY SICK GOING UP TO RUSSIA IT WASN'T TOO BAD GOING UP THROUGH THE CHANNEL AS I SAID BUT WHEN WE ACTUALLY GOT GOING I THOUGHT I BLAME I GOT BILLETED THEY HADN'T GOT ROOM FOR US DOWN IN THE MAIN PLACE AND I THOUGHT WELL I FELT SICK AS A DOG SO I CLEARED MYSELF AND WENT UP AND THEY GOT THE AFTER GUN TURRET TURNED FOREHEAD LOOKING FOREHEAD SO THAT IT WAS OPEN TO THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING ON THE BACK OF THE SHIELD AND IT HAD CURTAINS IN HEAVY CURTAINS TO GO OVER BECAUSE THERE WAS NO DOORS AND BEHIND THEM AND I SLEPT THERE ALL NIGHT I DID THE REST OF THE NIGHT COURSE I DID FALL ILL AND MY MATE HE WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WENT BUT I WAS NEVER SICK AGAIN I WASN'T SICK THEN I FELT SICK BUT I WAS NEVER LIKE IT AGAIN BUT I'D ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD SWIMMER AS YOU KNOW A DIVER I WAS GOOD AT DIVING BUT WHY THAT SHOULD UPSET ME LIKE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW BUT I STOPPED UP THERE UNTIL WE GOT TWO DAYS AWAY FROM LIKE AS YOU MIGHT SAY AND I NEVER LOOKED BACK THE SAVAGE WAS A ONE OFF SHIP SHE GOT A DEPTH UNDERWATER LIKE THE OLD UP AND DOWN ENGINE ONES SHE HAD ELECTRIC TURBINES STEAM TURBINES MADE ALL THE ELECTRIC BUT SHE DIDN'T DRAW HALF AS MUCH UNDER THE WATER AS AN ORDINARY DESTROYER OR AN ORDINARY SLOOP WHICH WAS PROVED ON THE LAST DAY OF THE WAR OR THE CONVOY AND WE WERE ALL WAITING AROUND OUTSIDE TO GO THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN GAP INTO THE RUSSIAN END AND THAT A U BOAT WAS WAITING FOR US AND WE WERE ALL THERE AND THE CONVOY WAS COMING IN IT'S ON THE TELLY SOMETIMES CONVOY WAS COMING IN AND SPREADING ABOUT BUT THE GERMANS WERE WAITING UNDERNEATH THE CLIFF BOTTOMS AND YOU COULD ONLY GO INTO THE DOCKYARD THROUGH AN ENTRANCE NOT MUCH WIDER THAN THAT WITH TWO GREAT PILLARS OF COASTLINE SO YOU HAD A GOOD ONE AT A TIME AND THE BIG LIBERTY SHIPS USED TO SQUEEZE THROUGH IT ANYWAY THIS WAS THE LAST CONVOY OF THE WAR AND WE WERE HANGING ABOUT THERE AS THE SHIPS WERE COMING IN WITH STUFF TO TAKE IN AND THE STEWARD BOAT WAS LAYING ON THE ROCKS AND OPPOSITE US IT WAS SNOWING IN THE MORNING WHEN WE TOOK UP OUR POSITION TO COVER THEM AS THEY COME IN BECAUSE THEY GOT LIBERTY SHIPS WITH THEM YOU KNOW WITH RAILWAY ENGINES ON THEM AND THAT FROM AMERICA AND THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENED ONE OF THEM GOT A TORPEDO IT WENT TO GO THROUGH THE OPENING INTO THE HARBOUR WHERE YOU GO FURTHER TO IT NOBODY COULD GET THROUGH IT BECAUSE THE SHIP BROKEN AFT AND SUNK IN THE GATEWAY WE CALLED IT A GATEWAY COURSE THAT WAS CHAOS THEN BECAUSE THE REST OF THE FLOTILLA OF AIR FLOTILLA AND THE PEOPLE COPIED TO BRING UP WERE COMING IN TO THIS BIG OPENING WHERE WE WERE ALL WAITING FOR TO GO IN AND WE WERE ALL READY FOR EVERYTHING IN ME AND MY MATE WERE PUT DOWN BELOW TO PUSH WHAT'S THE NAME DEPTH CHARGES ALL COME ON AND THEN THEY WERE PULLING THEM UP READY TO GO HEAD WE HEARD A TORPEDO COMING SO I DIDN'T BUT THE OTHERS ON DECK DID THEY COULD HEAR IT COMING BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WERE AND IT WENT UNDER THE SAVAGE AND IT HIT THE BRAND NEW SHIP JUST AS FAR AWAY AS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD AND EVERYBODY WAS PRACTICALLY KILLED ON IT IT SUNK LIKE THAT BRAND NEW BUT WHY DIDN'T IT HIT THE SAVAGE SHALLOW DRAFT SHALLOW DRAFT YEAH SHE HAD FLAT ENGINES THAT WERE DRIVEN BY SHAFTS THAT WAY NOT OUT THE BOTTOM AND THEY DROVE THESE TWO GENERATORS USED TO HAVE A GOOD DAY ONE OF MY JOBS I USED TO GO DOWN EVERY MORNING AND CHECK ALL THE THINGS THAT COULD HAVE STOPPED IT AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS RIGHT THAT WAS ONE OF MY JOBS YOU SEE AND I USED TO STAND THERE AND WATCH IT BECAUSE WHAT THEY WERE THERE WAS NO PROPELLERS AS THEY WERE ON THE BIGGER SHIPS WHICH WERE RIGHT LOW DOWN WEREN'T THEY WERE HOT AND IT WAS ONLY DRAWING HALF AS MUCH WATER AS ONE OF THEM AND THAT TORPEDO WENT UNDER US AND IT HIT THE OTHER SHIP THE OTHER SIDE AND WE PICKED SOME OF THE MEN UP SIX WE WE BURIED ONE BEFORE WE WENT IN A DARK WE WERE FIGHTING UNTIL DARK OUT THERE ALL THE REST OF THE SHIP AND YOU SEE WE COULDN'T THIS LIBERTY SHIP HIT IT WITH A TORPEDO AND IT BLOCKED THE ENTRANCE YOU SEE THEN IT WENT DOWN IN THE ENTRANCE AND HOW DID YOU GET RID OF THAT DO YOU REMEMBER WELL I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT WAS UP TO THE RUSSIANS TO DO THEIR OWN WORK AND THAT SO WE WERE FIGHTING UNTIL DARK THAT NIGHT AND IT WAS SNOWING AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING WHEN WE STARTED UNTIL IT GOT DARK AND IN FACT WE BURIED ONE CHAP IT WAS QUITE DUSK GETTING DARK AND WE BURIED HIM AND THEN WE HAD TO GO RIGHT UP NORTH FURTHER TO COME IN ANOTHER WAY FROM THE NORTH AND DOWN INSIDE THE WATER BECAUSE WE COULDN'T GET IN YOU SEE IT IT WAS TERRIBLE IT WAS THE LAST CONVOY THE WAR AND WHEN WE CAME OUT THEY'D OPENED UP THE RUSSIANS PARDON ME IT WAS CHRISTMAS AS WE HAD CHRISTMAS DAY THERE AND WE WERE THERE FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AND WHEN WE COME OUT WE COULD COME OUT THAT WAY AND WE CAME OUT AT MIDNIGHT TWO OF US AND WE HAD TO GO NORTH RUN UP THE COAST LINE AND THE OTHER ONE WENT WE WENT SOUTH AND THE OTHER ONE WENT NORTH LISTENING FOR U BOATS AND WHILE WE WERE THERE WE WERE DROPPING THE CONVOY WAS READY TO COME OUT THAT WAS COMING OUT EMPTIES ALL READY TO COME OUT AND WE WERE SENT EACH WAY US AND THE OTHER ONE TO KEEP ANYTHING DO YOU SEE AND TRY AND FIND IF ANYTHING WAS THERE WHAT WE WERE DOING THE CONVOY CAME OUT IN THE PITCH BLACK AND BY THE TIME IT GOT LIGHT IN THE MORNING THEY WERE WELL AWAY FROM WHERE WE WERE SO WE HAD TO SCRATCH UP AND CATCH UP YOU WHICH WE DID AND WE CAME HOME ALL RIGHT WE NEVER HAD NO PROBLEMS AFTER THE CONVOYS OF THE ARCTIC THEN I MEAN YOU DIDN'T STAY ON THE SAVAGE VERY LONG DID YOU WELL I STAYED ON ON THE SAVAGE UNTIL THE GERMAN SURRENDER AND WE CAME BACK DOWN TO CHATHAM CHATHAM BARRACKS AND THE DOCKYARD AND I WAS SENT FOR BECAUSE YOU SEE I WAS A VOLUNTEER I JOINED UNDER AGE HENCE IT MADE ME A VOLUNTEER NOT A CONSCRIPTED MAN WE CAME DOWN TO THE CHATHAM DOCKYARD I GOT SENT TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY HEADED IN AND OUT AND I HAD TO PACK MY KIT AND THE NEXT MORNING I WAS PUT ON A TRAIN WITH HUNDREDS MORE IN THE DOCKYARD LOCKED IN WITH KEYS AND THEY TAKE THEM OUT SO YOU CAN'T GET OUT AND THIS TRAIN WENT STRAIGHT OFF FLYING DOWN TO SOUTHAMPTON WE GOT OUT RUDDY GREAT LINE THERE WAITING FOR US ALL FULL OF PEOPLE GOING TO THE FAR EAST AND SHE WAS GOING TO SAIL AT HALF PAST EIGHT AND IT WAS HALF PAST SIX THEN AND YOU COULDN'T GET ON ANYWHERE FOR PEOPLE IT WAS A RUDDY GREAT AMERICAN LINE I CAN'T THINK OF THE NAME THEY WERE TWO OF THEM MADE BUT ANYWAY WE SAILED THAT NIGHT WITHIN TWO HOURS WE WERE ON THE WATER GOING OUT AND THAT TOOK US RIGHT OUT TO CEYLON AND THAT'S WHERE WE TOOK OFF THERE I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE WENT FROM THERE BECAUSE SHE WAS LOADED TO THE TOP WE HAD TO STOP FOR WE COULD GO THROUGH THE CANAL TO GET TO GET OUT TO THE BOTTOM END YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE TIME WE GOT THERE IT WAS PITCH BLACK AND WHEN WE WENT ON FROM THERE DOWN THE NEXT MORNING THROUGH THE CANAL BUT SHE WAS SUCH A BIG SHIP AND THE NEXT THING WE WENT RIGHT OUT TO CEYLON AND THAT'S WHERE THEY BUMPED US WAS THERE ANY DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING OF THAT TROOP SHIP NO THERE WASN'T NO BLOODY ROOM FOR US WE HAD TO BE ON THE TOP DECK AND IT WAS BLOWING A GALE WERE BLOODY GALE AND ALL OUR KIT HAD BEEN LEFT DOWN BELOW WHERE WE DUMPED ONLY GOT LOADS OF WOMEN ON THERE IN UNIFORMS AND THAT AND WE HAD TO SLEEP ON THE OPEN TOP DECK IT WAS BLOODY FREEZING IT WAS BUT WE WENT THROUGH THE CANAL AND WENT RIGHT OUT THEN STRAIGHT OUT TO CEYLON AND THEY DUMPED US SEEMED PRETTY INCREDIBLE REALLY WHEN YOU THINK YOU KNOW ONE MINUTE YOU'RE IN THE EARLY ARE IN A BATTLE AND ITS LATER THAT'S RIGHT A QUICK IT WAS THEY WERE WAITING FOR TROOPS YOU SEE AND SHE WAS FULL THAT SHIP THERE'S TWO OF THEM THEY HAD TWO OF THEM DID YOU HAVE ANY FEAR OF GOING TO THE FAR EAST NO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE DID I DIDN'T MEAN I HAD ANY SLIDING FEELING WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE BUT I DIDN'T I NEVER I WANTED IT YOU SEE THAT'S WHY I RUN AWAY AND JOIN THE NAVY YOUNG I WANTED THE NAVY AND WHEN THAT ALL CAME WELL I MEAN I WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD SHE WAS A NICE SHIP BUT I'D NEVER DONE ANY MINESWEEPING AND AND SHE WAS NOT IN THE CHATHAM SHIP YOU SEE BUT EVERYBODY ELSE WE GOT ON LIKE HOUSE AFIRE BUT THIS ONE BLOKE AND HE WAS IN THE SAME MESS AS ME HE USED TO SIT OPPOSITE ME AT THE TABLE AND ER I DON'T KNOW WHY HE TOOK A TO ME BUT ANYWAY HE FOUND OUT THAT I WAS A CHATHAM MAN AND THAT WAS WHAT I THINK STAR DID IT I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE REALLY BUT EVERYBODY ELSE WE WERE LIKE BRICKS TOGETHER BUT HE WHERE WE USED TO GO DOWN TO SLEEP BELOW IF WE IF WE GOT ANY DANGER WE USED TO OPEN THE LOW DOWN AND DOWN THERE YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER MESS DECK YOU HANG YOUR HAMMOCKS DOWN THERE IF YOU CAN AND HE WAS IN THE SAME MESS AS ME SITTING OPPOSITE ME AND HE JUST USED TO SNEER AT ME AND I NEVER HAD A BLOODY ENEMY ON THAT SHIP THEY MADE ME CHIEF QUARTERMASTER HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT YOU SEE AND OF COURSE THAT GIVE ME QUITE A RUN OF THE SHIP AND THEN THE CAPTAIN HE HAD ME UP HIS CABIN AND HE HAD A CHAP WITH ME AND TOLD ME WHAT HE'D LIKE ME TO DO AND IT WAS NICE I MEAN I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE STEERAGE WHICH MEANS THE OTHER CHAPS WERE UNDER ME STRAIGHT AWAY WELL I'D NEVER STEER THE BLOODY SHIP BUT I HAD TO I MEAN IT AIN'T GOT A COMPASS LIKE WHERE YOU SEE THE ISLE HANDS GOING YOU'VE GOT NUMBERS FLICKING BACKWARD AND FORWARD AND YOU HAD TO READ THEM AND BUT WE DID HAVE ONE OF THE OLD ONE WHAT ABOUT THIS SHIP THE JAPANESE SHIP YOU WERE ESCORTING TELL ME ABOUT THAT YEAH WELL THAT WAS THE BIGGEST OF THEIR CRUISE KENT SINKING DON'T ASK ME THE NAME I CAN'T TELL YOU BUT IT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE THEY HAD THAT HAD HAD AND SHE'D BEEN BOMBED AND SHE LAY IN THE HARBOUR WE USED TO GO BY HER EVERY TIME WE WENT IN AND OUT BUT WE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON THE BOTTOM BUT SHE WASN'T BUT ANYWAY IT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE OF THE JAPANESE SHIPS AND IT HAD BEEN BOMBED AND IT HAD BEEN IN SINGAPORE HARBOUR FOR QUITE SOME TIME SINCE IT WAS IT AND BUT ANYWAY WE KNOW THEY WERE MAKING IT READY TO TOW IT AND SINK IT YOU SEE AND WE GOT CHOSE TO DO IT AND WE WERE COMING ON OUR WAY HOME AS IT HAPPENED AND WE LEFT SINGAPORE WITH HER WITH A TUG WITH HER TO TALK WITH HER ACTUALLY AND SHE WAS A MASSIVE SHIP AND SHE'D BEEN EMPTIED AND EVERYTHING AND IT GOT DARK AND WE'RE COMING UP THE MALACCA STRAITS AND WE GOT TO THIS POINT WHERE SHE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN SUNK THE DEEPEST WATER BECAUSE SHE WAS THE BIGGEST ONE HAD AT THE TIME AND CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS PITCH BLACK AND WE WERE ON OUR WAY COMING TO COME HOME YOU SEE IT COME TO MIDNIGHT AND TWO JAPANESE TUGS WERE TOWING HER THEY HAD BEEN TOWING HER RED OUT ON AIR WELL IT WAS FAR AWAY FROM US FURTHER THAN THAT THE BIG HOUSE THERE THEY WERE FROM US BUT THEY WERE COMING UP AGAIN THE COAST LINING AND WE WERE FURTHER OUT WHERE WE COULD KEEP OUR EYE ON EVERYTHING AND AS I SAY IT GOT PITCH BLACK AND BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE POINT WHICH WE HAD A COMPASS READING WE GOT A SINKER ON THEY STARTED THE SHIP COMING UP AND LEFT HER THEY BOLTED AND LEFT THE SHIP WITH NO HEADWAY AND SHE'D COME HALFWAY UP NEARLY TO WHERE HE'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN SUNK AND I EXPECT I DON'T KNOW WHAT EVER AIR CAPTAIN GOT PERMISSION TO SINK HER BUT IT WAS MIDNIGHT PITCH BLACK AND WE HAD OUR SEARCH LIGHT ON HER AND THEY VANISHED INTO THE BLACK AND GONE OF COURSE SHE'S WELL SHE WOULDN'T DRIFT FURTHER BECAUSE I MEAN SHE'S A MASSIVE SHIP BUT SHE WAS ONLY JUST OFF THE COAST LINE WE THOUGHT PITCH BLACK AND I'M STILL ON THE BLOODY WHEEL I AM OF COURSE LOOKING OUT THE WHEELHOUSE WELL BECAUSE WE WEREN'T GOING WE WERE JUST BORING AND I SUPPOSE THE CAPTAIN GOT IN TOUCH WITH AIR PEOPLE AND THEY SAID WHAT TO DO SO WE HAD TO SEND MEN OVER WITH DEPTH CHARGES BECAUSE WE CARRIED DEPTH CHARGES AND THEY GOT TO PUT THE DEPTH CHARGES AS LOW AS POSSIBLE IN THE SHIP BECAUSE THE WAS NOBODY ON THERE AND I MEAN IT WERE MASSIVE AND THEY'D GOT TO WIRE EVERYTHING UP AND ALL WE COULD DO WAS USE THEIR DEPTH CHARGES AND AND TRY THEM THAT WAS ALL WE COULD DO WELL WE DID WE DID IT IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN WE STARTED AND WE WERE DRIFTING AS FAR AWAY PERHAPS THIS FIRST HOUSE FROM HER AND COURSE YOU COULDN'T DO MUCH REALLY BECAUSE THE AIR MOTORBOAT WENT OVER AND THEY TOOK I THINK THEY PUT FOUR DEPTH CHARGES IN HER IN THE MOTORBOAT AND THAT'S ALL SHE HOLD YOU SEE CARRY AND SO THEY TOOK THEM OVER FROM OFF OF US THEY WERE OUR CREW YOU SEE DOING IT AND WHATEVER THEY DONE THEY WENT ABOARD THE SHIP AND THEY TOOK THESE DEPTH CHARGES AS THE CAPTAIN HAD SAID IT'S GOT TO BE DONE AND PUT THEM RIGHT DOWN IN THE LOWER END AS THEY COULD GET OF THE SHIP CAUSE I MEAN SHE WAS A BLOODY MASSIVE THING AND THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD AND FUSED EVERYTHING WOULD EXPLODE AND CAME BACK TO US AND BANG SHE DID SHE WENT DOWN AND BLEW THE BOTTOM OUT AND SHE WENT DOWN OF COURSE WE NEVER SEE HER NO MORE BECAUSE WE LEFT HER THERE WHETHER SHE WASN'T TOO FAR OFF THE COAST AND SHE WASN'T TOO FAR FROM PENANG THE SHIP WAS WE WERE GOING UP TOWARDS PENANG AND DID YOU SEE HER GOING DOWN THEN OH YEAH WE WATCHED HER WITH THEIR SEARCH LIGHTS YEAH A SPECIAL THING TO SEE YEAH WELL WE ONLY UNTIL WE SEE A MORE OR LESS THE MAST WAS STICKING OUT I THINK THAT'S ALL BUT SHE'S STILL GOING SHE'S STILL GOING DOWN SHE PITCHED MEN PUT DEPTH CHARGES ALL THE WAY ALONG SO WHEN SHE GOT TO A CERTAIN DEPTH THEY OPENED THE DEPTHS YOU KNOW THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP TO LET THE WATER IN AS YOU DO AND WE HAD TO SIT THERE UNTIL IT FILLED UP AND FILED THESE CHARGES BLOODY YOU NEVER SHOT LIKE IT IT WAS FABULOUS BUT OF COURSE WE WEREN'T ALLOWED HAD CAMERAS SO A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD MIND SWEEP YOU KNOW A STORY ABOUT WHAT YOU DO HOW YOU DO IT WELL THERE'S VARIOUS WAYS YOU CAN DO IT YOU CAN DO IT WITH WIRES OUT WITH FLOATS ON WATER THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN PUT DEPTHS DOWN PUT THEM DOWN TO CERTAIN DEPTHS AND LEAVE THEM DOWN THERE WAITING THEM DOWN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT'S GOING TO BE OVER THEM AND THAT WHEN YOU COME BACK BUT BASICALLY YOU ONLY DO IT TO CLEAR THE OCEAN IN THE AREA YOU'RE IN AND IF THERE'S BEEN SHIPS COLLIDING WITH THEM WE GET SUNK WE'D GET SENT OUT THERE TO SWEEP IT YOU HAVE ANY NEAR MISSES WITH THE MINES WELL WE'VE HAD THEM COME UP BESIDE US YEAH HAD TIME TO BUT WHEN YOU'RE ALL JOINED TOGETHER WITH GREAT STRONG BOILERS YOU'RE IN A FORMATION LIKE THAT AND EACH SIDE GOES OUT TO ANOTHER SHIP AND THEN THEY GO OUT TO ANOTHER ONE AND THEN OUT TO THE OTHER THEN YOU'VE GOT SEVEN BUT YOU'RE THE ONE IN THE FRONT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GOT PROBABLY MORE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU CAN SOUND THAN THE OTHERS THEY DO THAT SORT OF THING THEY KEEP IMPROVING ON CERTAIN THINGS AND WE MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S HOW YOU SWEEP THAT SWEEP YOU'RE ALL OVER LATCH EACH OTHER AND YOU ACTUALLY TIE YOU ACTUALLY GOT WIRES HOLDING YOU TOGETHER IN A POSITION NO NO NO IT'S ALL DONE FREE THEY IN THEY HAVE TO SET THERE ONE EACH SIDE OF YOU AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE AND THEN VICE VERSA FOR THE NEXT TWO AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT THAT'S WHEN YOU DO THAT TYPE OF SWEEP BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS YOU CAN SWEEP AND ER SO WE USED TO DO SWEEPS WITH LONG WIRES WE HAD A GREAT BIG THING ON OUR QUARTER DECK AND IT WAS FULL OF HEAVY WIRE AND WE USED TO LET THAT OUT WITH THINGS ON THAT YOU KNOW AND CAPTAIN ON THE BRIDGE HE'D SAY LET GO AND THEN YOU STOP IT WHEN I TELL YOU IT WAS A MASSIVE STACK OF WIRE ON A DRUM AND IT'S NOT HEAVY WIRE BUT YOU PUT ANYTHING ON THE END OF IT YOU SEE AND YOU COULD LET IT OUT AND IT WILL EXPLODE MINES OR YOU'LL FIND IT IF THERE'S ANY THERE YOU'LL KNOW WHERE YOU STAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER IF IT'S ALL ON UNLOCK REALLY YOU CAN'T LOOK DOWN IN THE SEA BUT WE USED TO SNAG UP ON WE SNAGGED UP ON AN AEROPLANE DOWN THERE THAT HAD CRASHED AND SO WE WERE TOLD IT I DON'T KNOW I NEVER SEEN IT BUT I KNOW WHEN IT SNAGGED IT AND I GOT AROUND THE SHIP BUT IT WAS A PLANE BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY KNEW BECAUSE WE DIDN'T STOP BUT YOU ALWAYS GOT SOMEBODY THAT MADE SOMETHING UP DIDN'T YOU YOU MENTIONED THIS ABOUT THIS CHAT YOU KNOW THIS CHATHAM AND THE POMP RATING WHEN YOU SAY YOU MADE LIFE DIFFICULT WHAT DO YOU MEAN HOW DID YOU DO THAT WAS WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WE COME HOME TO ENGLAND AND I HAD THE MOST OF THE TIME BECAUSE I USED TO GO UP AND SIT WITH THEM AND THEN I'D TAKE OVER BECAUSE I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM YOU SEE SO SO THEY DIDN'T ALL HAVE A A LONG THING I JUST TAKE IT YOU SEE AND HELD OUT AND ONE NIGHT DOING THAT I HAD TO BE A QUARTER MASTER WHICH MEANS WHEN WE WERE AT ANCHOR I HAD TO DO A DUTY AT THE BACK OF THE SHIP WHERE WERE THEY COME IN AND OUT OF IT HE WAS ASHORE AND ONE THING OR ANOTHER AND ALL THE LOG BOOKS THERE AND EVERYTHING AND I WAS ON DUTY THERE DOING MINE AND WE WERE ALMOST COMING HOME AT THIS POINT AND I GOT A TERRIBLE THROAT AND COLD AND IT WAS POURING RAIN AND I HAD TO TAKE THE NIGHT WATCH AND I THOUGHT WELL I GOT FEELING COLD AND I HADN'T TOOK MY OILSKINS OUT OF MY LOCKER BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN THERE SINCE I PUT THEM IN BEFORE WE WENT ABROAD I MEAN YOU DIDN'T HAVE HAD AND I THOUGHT GOD I GOT TO GO DOWN TO GET MY OILSKINS AND OF COURSE I'M STANDING IN AN OPENING WHERE YOU CAN GO IN THAT SIDE AND WALK STRAIGHT OUT AND FALL OFF THE SHIP THE OTHER SIDE AND AT NIGHT TIME THE THERE'S AN OFFICER AND A CREW COME ROUND THE SHIP AND THEY CHECKED FOR YOU BEING LOOKED AFTER AND THAT WELL AS I WENT DOWN TO GET MY I NIPPED DOWN BECAUSE I GOT THE DUTY WATCH TO GET MY OIL SKIN OUT AND I GOT A TERRIBLE COLD AND THIS CHAP SLUNG HIS HAMMOCK RIGHT ACROSS THE TOP OF THE OPENING WHERE I HAD TO WALK DOWN THE STEP UNDER TO AND HE'S SWINGING ABOUT IN HIS HAMMOCK YOU SEE AND OF COURSE THIS IS ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND UNBEKNOWN TO ME THE BOAT COME ROUND AND SEEING THAT I WASN'T THERE BUT THEY DIDN'T CATCH NOTHING BUT HE TOLD THE CAPTAIN THAT I HAD BEEN DOWN THE LOCKER AND I WAS HAVING A JOB TO GET MY THING OPEN BECAUSE IT WAS ALL STUCK TOGETHER BEING OUT IN THE HEAT OF COURSE WE NEVER WORE THEM YOU SEE HERE AND THE NEXT THING HE DROPPED ME IN IT AND HE WENT AND TOLD THE OFFICERS OF THE DAY THAT I WAS GONE DOWN TO SLEEP AND I'M SITTING TRYING TO GET THIS BLOODY THING OPEN BECAUSE I GOT A LAZY COLD AND HE'D DONE THAT AND THE NEXT THING HE SENT FOR THE OFFICER OF THE DAY HE'D COME DOWN PUT ME ON A CHARGE HAD TO MEET THE CAPTAIN AND EVERYTHING AND ERM CAPTAIN DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL BUT ANYWAY HE TOLD ME TO FORGET EVERYTHING HE SAYS YOU'RE YOU'RE MY MAN HE SAID NEVER MIND ABOUT HIM HE SAID WE'VE HAD TROUBLE WITH HIM BEFORE I BROUGHT THE SHIP HOME RIGHT THE WAY UP TO THE DOCKYARD DOWN SOUTH AND THE NEXT DAY I COME HOME HAD THREE DAYS LEAVE AND THEN HAD TO GO BACK DOWN TO CHATHAM AGAIN AND THEY OF COURSE THE MOB IN WERE ALL FINISHED YOU SEE BUT THEN AND I WASN'T GOING TO BE THEY NEVER GAVE ME A BLOODY MOB AND I THINK SO I WENT TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THEY SAID OH YOU'RE GOING UP TO SCOTLAND THERE'S A SHIP UP THERE YOU'RE GOING ON SO I SAID OH YEAH HOW AM I GOING TO GET HE SAID IT'S ALRIGHT TWO OTHER CHAPS COMING UP WITH YOU YOU WERE ALL BACON TOGETHER AND THAT WAS THAT BIG SHIP UP THERE AND ER BUT OF COURSE SHE WAS ONLY ON LOAN TO THE DURING THE WAR YOU SEE TO US LIKE A CANADIAN AND SHE WAS GOING TO GO HOME AND I WAS BILLETED ON FOR THEY PUT US ON THERE TO SLEEP AND EVERYTHING AND FEED WAS QUITE A FEW OF US AND WE SLEPT ON BOARD AND EVERYTHING BUT BY THE TIME THEY WANTED TO TAKE HER HOME TO CANADA THEY SENT FOR ME AND I WENT TO THE OFFICE AND I HAD A BIT OF A PROBLEM AND I HAD TO SEE THE DOCTOR AND THE BLOODY DOCTOR SAID I WASN'T FIT TO GO SO THEY PAID ME OFF THE DAY BEFORE IT SAILED AND I HAD TO COME OUT IN THE NAVY YEAH I'D GOT SOMETHING IN THE CHEST AND I HAD TO SEE THE DOCTOR AND HE SAID YOU YOU'RE NOT FITTING OF ANY MORE FOR NAVY A CHEEKY BUGGER
