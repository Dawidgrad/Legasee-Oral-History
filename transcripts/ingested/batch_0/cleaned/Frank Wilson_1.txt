well my name is frank wilson i've been in the navy i was a naval seaman but i was an air gunner on the activity we was employed on the flight day of course we had two jobs you see we had guns on the flight deck as well as in the aircraft excellent okay well look i mean before we get to the activity just where are you from and what do you remember dronfield well i mean virtually i went from not at school i started being an apprenticeship in sheffield but then when the war came on of course i wanted to go in the navy anyway so i went to cherry street in sheffield and signed on there as a boy seaman what year was that oh dear about nineteen forty i would think why did you want to be in the navy if you're from dronfield i don't know it's just something i wanted to do i suppose i always fancied being in the navy in fact i wanted to stop in after the war but they was blowing everybody out they just didn't want you all right okay what do you remember of that transition then from being a boy in dronfield to a navy man my first training my first training was at collingwood it had just opened then at that time and it was still in its infancy and it's still there to this day collingwood is there anything that you can remember from your training no not really i think i enjoyed it to be truthful i think we done about ten weeks at collingwood and then i went to wellesley at liverpool and that was me in liverpool to a gunnery training school and first start as an anti aircraft gunner did you want to get into guns or did they give no choice well i don't think you got any choice really you know they put you where they felt like i mean i had a friend who has died now he lived down the shore and he didn't want to be an electrician and he finished up as one of course after the war that were his trade for the rest of his life but he didn't want it in the first place he was on the activity as well yes were you at cheddar waiting huh were you cheddar no portsmouth did you have any sentiment towards being a rating did that bother you no no no what do you mean the sentiment in what way well you know the rivalry between the different port divisions were you aware of it well i think there was rivalry all of the time davenport goes and i finished up there when i came back from far east but now we all mix together when did you get a draft then where when when and where when i done my twelve week training straight away what do you remember of that i can remember we came up from portsmouth to chesterfield stopped over in chesterfield and then went on up to dundee to peek the activity did you know you were going on an aircraft carrier no we thought it was a destroyer actually because this place where we were staying it was just outside of portsmouth they'd closed the portsmouth barracks down because we were getting badly bombed and it was about ten mile out of portsmouth this place and we were all initiates you know they posted a list on the board of ships and of course we never heard of activity because there was some destroyers and aircraft active and we thought it was one of them because when we got over there it's scary being well we were ashore for about three months till commissioning time when did you first go aboard well we was going aboard everyday because we were in private digs there's no accommodation on it at the time and plus we were in private digs we used to go every morning we didn't have to march up in we just walked up in what different digs we were in and we were commissioning at the time i didn't realize that i was going to go on to what it was going to be because we were the first part of the crew it went to the rest came up in i think it was september something like that can you remember what it was like to see the activity when it was so new like that couldn't believe it huge ship that was about fourteen thousand ton we thought it was a destroyer it was going to are there any stories that you can recall from that period when you were commissioning already is there anything that stand out anything that you remember not really because everybody's busy the gunners had to go around their guns and see they were commissioning them what do you mean by commissioning what are you doing well you're getting the ship ready for sea which is a hell of a lot of work involved with this ammunition in your ships depth charges we had all the depth charges to get done torpedos for the planes all of course food and everything it was quite a big job to commission a ship were there aircraft on her at this stage no no no no we went out to sea to pick them up what was your gun position then i was on forward starboard there were two laser guns i think twenty four sets of very heavily armed and two four inch at the stern the flat deck members on them three up on the flat deck you never manned a gun when you're flying obviously but when you got action stations you were never flying you couldn't have aircraft taking off while them germans were coming over could you everybody had two jobs in those days do you remember setting sail for the first time yes well not really because the first time we set sail was when we was going on trials to see that she was sea worthy what were your sea legs like well they weren't bad pretty good i can't remember being sea sick at all the skip it was captain willoughby he was an absolute gentleman and was he on board at the time of the commissioning no he was there he was there before he was coming down everyday from his digs wherever he were of course all the different officers i can remember one lieutenant commander marr he was a navigating officer and he was an absolute gentleman as well he'd been on canard liners and after the war he went back to them and he finished off his commodore he was a grand chap when you say they're lovely people were they talking with you oh yes you get some the officers they won't talk to you you know to me it was a different class of people type of thing he would come down i can remember we came back form first russian trip and old willoughby came down and he said she's looking such a bloody mess this ship we're going to have to have it painted before we go out to war again he came down hisself put a pair of old gloves on and a pot of paint he was an absolute gentleman he was everybody will tell you that who was on activity yes he was when did you go out and pick up the aircraft and what was that like can you remember them coming on first time i can remember them coming on but only vaguely actually we went to the clyde sailed up to clyde to pick the aircraft up is the ship moving or stationary when they land oh no moving yes as much speed as possible to get so they create a wind across the decks we had swordfish and fighters and they were grand little plane they was easy to handle well we used to handle them on deck you see and most of them was stuck on deck permanently because there's only room for about four aircraft in the hangar the rest was stuck on deck we had special shields i know we used to have when we were deck landing training we used to leave we got up at six in the morning and get back about eight at night every day for seven days not for five but seven days doing flying training all the time by the time we got out we use to go right in the middle of clyde and they come from i think they call this place these trainee pilots come and practice landing on it it was quite a i suppose they're still there it was very odd with that when they said we were going out hector said everybody get a chair we were after we would venture off on winter night to service and doing that i mean you were getting planes landing on they were crashing on what was the procedure for fires and stuff fires yes did you have a process if a plane crashed and burst into flames we got fire practice i think majority of the time if a plane did crash and caught into flame these guys push it over to the side and get rid of it because it won't be any good did you the pilots oh yes you got this crew that's out did you meet the pilots did you get to oh yes we met quite a few of them in fact there was one golden his name he was training to be a pilot i saw him i think about two hours when he passed out he went to a different carrier never saw him again after that there were different people it's hard to say really most of them we got in school students landing on a carrier it wasn't easy on that mission convoy we'd sometimes go thirty degree so went like that they were taking off on them i saw they all if a plane comes to land you'd be landing that when a plane comes to land all of the sudden if you go like that of course a plane if you just bump it land it was swordfish they were all right in one way because what happened with them if they did that then the undercarriage collapsed so they land flat on deck without their undercarriage so the crew got out was there wire to stop them the rest were wires oh yes it trusted that there were four activity we had seven big barriers to come up as well in front of the bridge right across if a plane would stall ways it went straight into at least he didn't knock the plane over its side one way we're doing that to make landing training we were spending about twelve hour at doing it then we had to sail back into greenock sometimes i get to nine o'clock at night before we go away that's in six where i'd live i can when they said we finished we're doing it now we're in the action station we're in active service everybody cheered thank god for that i mean it was the same engine room they had the same problems the ability of that engine the engine room staff was called t one two four t one two four actually much of the seamen come into the navy for six months of course they were that short of engineering staff in the navy after six months to put an x on so they couldn't get out they were better off than us financially because they're getting an extra navy pay watching people like just tell me not your action station the guns but just tell me what are you doing on the deck just talk me through it sort of a day if you like when you were flying when you were flying yes you would faced the planes up out to the hanger on what you could you got them all ready that was it really took off we got nets down the side where you used to jump in and when they were taking off when you say you got them ready what do you mean because there's the wings were folded they had to be wings folded up you had to take they were wound up you know you'd wind the engine up on a swordfish i get that yes just like a car starting thing you know you used to start the cars in the old days you used to wind the engine up like that on the swordfish when you got it really going and the engine turned over it fired this cartridge pilot used to fire it and that finished it off off she went i don't know whether you got to know any names i had a mate pat oettle his name was he come from down woking in surrey he walked into a propeller blade but he were lucky it knocked him out at road they said if he'd been walking the other way it would have killed him obviously the plane just hit him i don't whether the plane hit him or whether wind did it or whatever but he were lucky what's it like on the deck just describe the movement how many planes are being maneuvered at the same time and how many of you are doing that job there's a flight deck party up on there you can see them everybody was occupied with doing something lots of the rest of the wires had to be seen to there's lots of jobs taking off weren't as bad as landing when they landed you had to get them in front of the barrier there used to be a barrier thrown a bridge across and you wheeled the planes up and got them in front of the barrier so that the other aircraft could land without doing any damage how long did you get from a touchdown to moving a plane out of the way i can't remember it weren't very long i know we used to run with them so it weren't very long they used to circle round the ship and see because the batsman then would give them a signal did you ever do any batting no it was officers that done that the chap we had doing that was i can always remember his name we called him temple west he'd been on another carrier which got badly bombed in malta he got transferred to this one we had a one legged pilot on as well he'd lost his leg in an aircraft accident did the batsmen ever get it wrong do you ever remember incidents yes i should imagine so if the plane come in a bit too high obviously it weren't going to land he had to wave them round did you ever lose any over the side yes because what happened after activity when we fully commissioned because we'd got the biggest flight deck of any escort carrier they used us as a training carrier for nearly six months up and down the clyde we had quite a few go over the side up there in fact they'll still be at the bottom of clyde trainee pilots coming into land i don't know whether you know owt about it or not but there's one called the dasher it was an american built carrier blew up in the clyde there were four hundred killed on it we was in harbour at the time in greenock because that were our base we was waiting to go out that day and they stopped us going they said a ship's been torpedoed that's all we heard but it wasn't that even to this day they are still discounting what happened some of the survivors said all the time they were on that ship they could smell aviation fuel so it was a bad fuelling system they always think that something blew it up another thing somebody said was a bloke was smoking and that atmosphere and they threw match down and set it off which sounded a bit daft the people in were opposite on the clyde they saw the lip blown up in the air and they say it went about seventy eighty foot up in the air there was some blows on it before it come crashing down it must've been the aviation fuel that'll blow even now i don't really go every year now to where it is we didn't they wouldn't let us go because they said the sea we could see it from greenock we could see all the smoke and they said the sea was afire with aviation fuel so it's got with blowing up if you ever get the chance you'll get a book about hms dasher and it will tell you all about it what's happened at the time when that's happened the dasher blow up of course there's no escort carriers so we had to go onto the russian convoyed what do you remember of your first russian convoyed i don't know really now i don't know damn cold it takes some remembering all them years it was very cold you didn't put on the ship's side just stick to it i think first trip it was about fifty below something like that we went to this what we did we escorted when the battleship royal sovereign and this american one i forget i think it was missouri and handed them over to the russians there were twelve submarines i think it's twelve one of them got sunk by an raf plane by missouri just tell me a bit about what the work was on say an artic convoy what were you doing what was your we was managing the guns all the time except when we were flying because we had two jobs everybody had two jobs in them days do you remember becoming under attack oh yes got attacked quite a few times yes i do it's hard to say it's a long while ago it's hard to remember what actually happened but one thing that always sticks in my mind was we was coming back off one convoy and hms bluebell one of our escorts we use to fuel them at this point it blew up we thought it was torpedo it went down probably that a fire accident somewhere i can also remember that because everybody went mad we knew all the ships' company we met them when they come aboard they did all out really all out they got the shield doing it and blew it up wait did you see the bluebell go down yes we all did everybody that were on that side on the front side of the ship yes just poof it's just gone she was one of our escorts we also operated with escort group onto what's his name's convoy we did looked up we were quite a busy ship because they were very scarce a full size carrier were useless on convoy work these escorts were just right this one we got we only got about four i don't know others were american built things nobody liked them they weren't very good there was a wooden flight deck for starters which is very bad why was the activity a good escort carrier she was well built she got a long flight deck which was very good for taking off and landing i seen a swordfish take off of the activity before it's got halfway down the deck it's airborne which you won't get on one of these american ones she was a good ship very stable actually it was built as a refrigerator ship originally she weighed fourteen thousand tons she was quite big weren't she just describe your living conditions and how you kept warm and what you wore what you put on it stayed on you never has a wash or anything you just couldn't somebody would say if you went up had a piddle it would freeze before it left your you know it was that bad you never washed or anything for about five or six weeks when you got back to scapa flow you went into what's her name centre to get cleaned up you never took your clothes off what about your mess describe your mess in what way what do you mean where you slept where you ate that's what i'm saying where you ate and how much used to be your mess tables you know in them days well it was hard iron rations that's all there was really i mean you used to run out of bread after about two days they used to have these bloody rice cakes i remember them damn things now a days they're a delicacy aren't they the thing about it was when the work we done was russian convoys we went straight out far east finished up in ceylon before we get there did you get ashore in russia did i get what did you get ashore in russia yes what do you remember of the russians you see it's hard to say you didn't look like sailors i'll put it that way you were wearing such heavy clothing you ain't got naval uniforms on or anything you've got your big grey coat on they could have been anybody the germans were that close to murmansk they didn't know who we were they got a bit shy over it at first we used to do what we could with them we'd take all the to them because they were starving there was no doubt about it of course none of them could speak english mostly women anyway because even women were working on dockside there most of the men had gone to war hadn't they now it's hard to describe really what they were like you could understand them being scared of us because we could have been anybody how did you feel at the time can you remember was their fear of death and stuff like that i don't think that entered your head really the fear of dying or anything i don't think that was on your mind at all that's what i'm saying i can't remember really i can't remember feeling scared or anything did captain willoughby ever slow down and create a rescue for anything well he couldn't we couldn't no we weren't allowed to anyway because we were a sitting target all the time for the german aircraft they knew what because we got fighters on who could send fighters off straightaway after the german aircraft and shoot them down we did get rid of quite a few of them with tracker you know an aircraft carrier never stopped it couldn't it had to have an escort of about i think we had about four class corvettes as our escorts we had to you daren't you wouldn't have dared stopped for anything because that would have been it where did the activity sit in the convoy it varied usually in the middle usually sat in the middle they were so precious the aircraft carriers in them days that they had to be guarded because with us having fighters on and also we had swordfish they were armed with torpedoes or depth chargers whichever they were a big menace to the germans we had quite a few going out there i know i got hit with a bullet ones but i think it might have been from america you never know what happened that day well the usual well they used to come over didn't they planes probably two or three times a day you never knew because they're only in norway it was very close we had to have a good cover the carriers the escort carriers done a marvellous job because they got the fighters to fight of and take off and chase them you got hit you got a bullet i did what happened that day i don't know i don't even know where it come from it would be another raid you see wouldn't it we was getting raids everyday all the way there and all the way back it was just as easy to sink the ships coming back empty as it were full ones there were no let up after the artic did you then go out and do atlantic duties or was it the same sort of time well we were doing atlantic before artic convoys they were all mixed up and then we did some mediterranean ones i had a list somewhere i should imagine we covered about twenty different convoys altogether we worked with one called the tracker we worked together because tracker was a camera ship not us whatever pictures were taken were taken on there we did mediterranean as well went down med do you remember what you were doing down there well we were escorting convoys again dropped them off at malta and then we went straight on to alexandria and then down we didn't know where we were going at the time we finished up going down the canal to ceylon we thought we were going back to the uk back to gibraltar that wasn't the case you never knew where you were going from one day to the next was willoughby still with you when you went through the canal yes we lost him just after i can't remember exactly when it were really what happened he knows more about that frank than me because he was quartermaster and they got rid of him and this captain north or somebody came on entirely different fellow yes we were going from freezing cold at north went out the far east and we got no tropical gear when we got into columbo they got us fitted out with tropical gear you know shorts and tropical shirts et cetera up until then we'd only got winter clothing funny thing about all this about this convoy we used to sale out of greenock and the people in greenock could tell you way you were going how did they get to know does make you think doesn't it but hey did when you got to the far east do you remember rescuing the ss peter sylvester that was quite a while after yes first of all we thought it was a japanese u boat or whatever we didn't know what it was then they happened to spot it and said it was a ship full of these sailors yes american do you remember what happened what when we brought them on board yes i do they'd gone down to nothing they'd lost about well they were twenty days in that boat we took them to fremantle then we went round to sydney and then came back to middle east and we got paid off what else did you do in the far east we went up and down the burma coast chasing bloody japs did you ever get kamikaze we didn't no we never got them we tangled with a japanese cruiser once i got paid off out there they got rid of the flight deck party completely i joined the barrick county class cruiser what was it like leaving the activity leaving all your mates weren't you really the older end on the flight deck there was a bloke called sylvester three badgerman he was getting over sixty because they kept him on you see they kept george morrison old george they kept him on they kept quite a few older granddaughters with all this young ones we went war was getting well on by that time especially in england what they were doing i think they were men over forty i think i'm not sure which he hadn't repatriated but younger were kept out you see do you remember the end of the war yes i was at sea at the time i went to an activity i was on the barrick county class cruiser i went into singapore we went into singapore on activity in there and of course we got permission to on board it george morrison then got a party going for kids it was chinese kids who they've been starving aren't they the activity brought lots of prisoners of war back most of them i don't know for sure they said quite a lot died in shulan last year of course they were rounding all japanese lots of japanese were committing harakiri and killing the sons and doing whatever funny enough i went to merchant service about fifteen years after this still found some japanese soldiers out in jungle and war or how do you reflect on the war now in what way though what's your sentiment towards it i don't know what to say really it makes you wonder did we do a good job or what it's awful at times makes you wonder what i say the country in today makes you wonder why we did it i think i said we've probably reached out are there any other stories you've got that you think oh i must remember to tell him that what's that any other stories about what though about your service on the activity no not really it's similar to say since i've been past it seventy years ago isn't it you mellow a bit don't you after that time end of audio
