what what do you remember of your first russian convoy don't know really now i know i was let down cold i do so remember all the as might wouldn't it yeah it was very cold if you you didn't put down on the ship's side or stick to it that i think i was first trip in one was about fifty below something like that then we went to up and we took this and what we did we escorted with the battleship royal sovereign and a no no this american one i forget we i think it was misery i handed him over to russians and there were twelve submarines i think up i think it's twelve or hat and one of em got shrunk by an aria plane by mistake just tell me a bit about what what the work was on san arctic convoy what we do what was your well we was managing the guns all the time except we when we were flying cause we had two jobs you see everybody had two jobs in them days and you remember began be coming under attack oh yes i got take the air quite a few times he do it it sees such a long while ago i had to remember about it didn't it what actually happened but one thing i always sticks in mind was we were coming back off one convoy and ms bluebell at one of our escorts used well we used to feel them come it blew up a well it was torpedoed and went down with all lands and that was probably back off iceland somewhere and i can also remember that because everybody went mad when they cussed it i mean we knew all the ship's company we'd met em you know they wanted to come aboard like in a tide all out really all out to hunt for this they got the show but at done it and blew it up which did you see the blue bob yes now we all did and everybody was on that side up port side of the ship here yeah now she just but was just gone but she was one of our escorts you see but that we also operated with the killer walker's escort group untainted that was named convoys we did lot out atlantic ones will quite a busy ship because they were very scarce you know it they come a full sized carrier were useless on convoy work and these escorts were just right it is one we got we'd only got about four and i don't know and other american built things and nobody liked them so they weren't very good there's a wooden flight deck for starters which is very bad why why was the activity a good escort carrier well she was well built she got a long fly at da which which was very good for taking off and landing i mean i've seen her sofie take off of activity and before she got half way down the deck it's airborne which she won't get on one of these american ones no because she was she was a good ship like very very stable yeah well i mean it was it was built actual it was built on a refrigerator ship originally termite eight fourteen thousand tons so she's quite big won't she just describe your living conditions and how you kept warm what you wore a you want what you what you put on he stayed on you never had a wash or anything he just couldn't if you see to say if you went up file and let out a bit a little freeze before for it left you you know it was that bad he never washed or anything about five or six weeks on mine he got back to to a scrap of flow he went into was an m center and you know to get cleaned up never took your clothes off and what about your mess with the scribe mess in what way to do in where he slept where you ate well that's what i'm saying we were at an arms used to be slung over you mesttables you know in them days but did well just that it was a hard hard i in russians that's all we were really men used to run out of bread after about two days and then on us to have these bloody rice cakes and as i remember them damn things now there's their delicacy at le see at the thing about it was when we done as russian convoys we went straight out far east
