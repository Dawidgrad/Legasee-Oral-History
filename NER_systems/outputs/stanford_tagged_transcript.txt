 My name is <PER>Colette<\PER> <PER>Claire<\PER> <PER>Cook<\PER> and I was originally, before I was married my surname was <PER>St<\PER> <PER>George<\PER> <PER>York<\PER>. So Colette, just tell me, where are you from and what was life like prewar what determined your future? Well, I think the thing was first of all I had good parent. My mother was Irish; my father was very English and in actual fact had fought in the First World War in the Highland Light Infantry and won the <ORG>Military<\ORG> <ORG>Cross<\ORG> in the Somme and, um, we had a very happy childhood in <LOC>Harrogate<\LOC>, we really did and we used to go on holiday every summer to my mother’s relatives in <LOC>Ireland<\LOC>, and we use to, we had a lovely childhood really when I think about it. A very happy childhood with very good parents. And did you have a sense as a young person that things were changing, that there might be a war or was it literally, war was declared? I think we used to hear my parents talking about, I think the first thing I remember, in actual fact, was hearing, because we used to listen to the radio a lot and I think the first thing I remember is coming back from <LOC>Munich<\LOC> waving a piece of paper. <PER>Chamberlain<\PER>, <PER>Neville<\PER> <PER>Chamberlain<\PER> and in actual fact I’ve often thought since that man was a bit of a hero ‘cause he knew perfectly well. He had to buy us at least a year and he made himself look a fool. That’s only my own personal feeling, looking back, you know. And, um, I don’t think we knew, I think the first thing was, we used to reach a lady, we used to go out for walks with my mother, um, or maybe when we were going to school, because <PER>Shelia<\PER> and I went to the convent, the Holy Child Convent in <LOC>Harrogate<\LOC> where we got a very good modern education which was marvelous with modern thinking. We used to talk to a Mrs <PER>Menuhin<\PER> and apparently she was <PER>Yehudi<\PER> <PER>Menuhin<\PER>’s aunt and she had come over to this country from <LOC>Germany<\LOC> in 1936, something like that, and I think she told my mother and I remember her telling me that things were happening like somebody would disappear or be taken away in the night and some weeks after that a little box would be delivered by the postman, whatever it was, with ashes inside. . So it was kind of known that things were happening but I don’t think it was generally known. Where were you when war did break In <LOC>Harrogate<\LOC>. Do you remember the What is said Well when we were living in <LOC>Harrogate<\LOC>, in actual fact, we were in <LOC>Ireland<\LOC> on holiday and we always used to go from <LOC>Liverpool<\LOC>, we used to like the boat journey most of all I think from <ORG>Liverpool<\ORG> it used to be an eight hour journey. <ORG>Liverpool<\ORG> to <LOC>Dublin<\LOC>, and we used to leave the car then get the overhead railway in <LOC>Liverpool<\LOC>, out of the, I don’t know what dock it was <PER>Gladstone<\PER> I think and at this particular time it was the week before war broke out, funnily enough, and there was a mock air raid in <LOC>Liverpool<\LOC> and then they wouldn’t let us board the ship and there were all sorts of things going on ???? we didn’t sail until about 6 o’clock in the morning instead of 10 o’clock the night before. And we went, the first people we went to visit was my aunt and uncle up in <LOC>Caven<\LOC> which is just south of the northern border and my uncle, in actual fact, was a detective and I remember us sitting there listening to <PER>Jim<\PER> and I can remember my father say, “Oh my God, not another bloody war!” listening to the radio. And so to come back it was a bit of a performance really cos we couldn’t, we couldn’t come back the way we’d gone because they were taking those Liverpool-Dublin ships over for hospital ships so we had to go <ORG>Holyhead<\ORG>, <LOC>Dunmurry<\LOC>. And the ships were all blacked out and it was rough and I can remember we got on the train at <LOC>Holyhead<\LOC> and the lights were all covered with blue paper and I think that was it, you know, but we thought it was a bit exciting, I think. . My parents must have been worried silly. And we’d also heard, in actual fact that the <LOC>Athenia<\LOC> had been sunk. The Athenia was the first ship to be torpedoed up in the <LOC>Northern<\LOC> <LOC>Irish<\LOC> <LOC>Sea<\LOC>, I think, and I think there were a number of Americans on it which caused a bit of a stir for the time being. So how did war change things for you in <LOC>Harrogate<\LOC> Well the first thing that happened, in actual fact, was there was an air raid siren, I can’t remember whether it was the end of 1939 or the beginning of 1940 because there was a bomber over <LOC>Harrogate<\LOC> in fact they had heard an awful lot of the chaps that were later on training to be pilots in <LOC>America<\LOC> and <LOC>Canada<\LOC> came back to <LOC>Harrogate<\LOC> first of all before they were sent to their units and the siren went, so we all got in the cupboard under the stairs and my two brothers and sister rushing out to have a look and I said “It’s a Dornier,” and I know the other one said “It’s not a Dornier, it’s a Heinkel,” and there was an argument went on and nothing much happened really, but my mother used to say “If a German comes to the door, I’m going keep my garden,” the thing that you put anti-pest control things in, “I’m going to keep that and if a German comes to the door I shall pump it full!” and my father used to say, “Yes, I can see him standing there like a lemon while you pump insecticide into his face!” And then of course there was the question of rationing and my mother… … my father was in timber and plywood and that was taken over by the government, so he had to find another job and joined the <ORG>Ministry<\ORG> <ORG>of<\ORG> <ORG>Aircraft<\ORG> <ORG>Production<\ORG>, which meant a reduction in his salary in what he was getting, but nonetheless it was better than nothing and my mother also got a job there as well, although she was a trained nurse, but by that time she was, I suppose, in her forties, I would have thought, in actual fact. And then my father got sent to <LOC>London<\LOC>. So he was in the <ORG>Ministry<\ORG> <ORG>of<\ORG> <ORG>Aircraft<\ORG> <ORG>Production<\ORG> <ORG>on<\ORG> <ORG>Milbank<\ORG> and then <ORG>Thames<\ORG> <ORG>House<\ORG>, or wherever it was, and that’s how, I don’t know that it, I think, in actual fact we kind of took it as it came, I think when you’re kids, you know. I mean I must have been about thirteen when war broke out, I think, fourteen, I can’t remember. But it was kind of a bit exciting and my aunt who lived in <LOC>Liverpool<\LOC> who was a bit of an invalid, she came to live with us for a while and I can see her sitting by the fire in our house while my two brothers had this thing down from the table and they had Dinky toy naval ships on it and there was a row. “I sunk the Ark Royal!” “No you haven’t sunk the Ark…” “I sunk the…” and my aunt saying, “Boys, boys. There’s enough war going on without you two going to blow through the dining room. .” So this is how, people think it was all drama all at once, do you know what I mean? But then you gradually began to realise there was <LOC>Dunkirk<\LOC> and all the rest of it, but I decided I wanted to join up but I couldn’t do it till I was seven… well with my father’s permission it was seventeen and a half and on my own account it was eighteen and I didn’t want to wait until I was eighteen. Why did you want to be a I’ve no idea! I just wanted to. Why does anybody want to join a particular thing, you know? I was always mad keen on history. I mean nowadays I am still very keen on history, military history in particular, and, um, that’s what I wanted to do. Ok, so when you had the opportunity to join, just talk through the process… Well, the thing, the thing is, I wanted to join the WRENs and I wanted to join as soon as I could which was seventeen and a half but I had left school when I was sixteen and I wanted to do something so the man that lived next door to us was the works manager of the <ORG>Yorkshire<\ORG> ????? <ORG>Chemical<\ORG> <ORG>Company<\ORG> in <LOC>Leeds<\LOC> in Hunslet so he said “Well you can have a job in our laboratory where we tested stuff coming up from the factory against standards that we have.” And I worked there for a year. My sister used to complain that I smelt when I came home and I used to go back between <LOC>Harrogate<\LOC> and <ORG>Leeds<\ORG> everyday on the train and I think I earned 22 and sixpence a week in old time money and I think I used to be able to treat my sister to things and do all sorts of things. I used to walk up into the centre of <ORG>Leeds<\ORG> at lunchtime and go to <PER>Lyons<\PER> and have my lunch or whatever it was. . Anyway, eventually the time came when I could, dad willingly gave me, because he said he’d enjoyed being in the forces and being in the <ORG>Highland<\ORG> <ORG>Light<\ORG> <ORG>Infantry<\ORG>, so I applied and it must have been just at the time when they were wanting to increase more people for what we called P5, and I’ll explain that a bit later. So I was summoned for an interview in <LOC>Leeds<\LOC>, I think, I can’t remember much about it and the next thing I knew I’d been accepted and on my way to <LOC>London<\LOC>. I’d never been to <LOC>London<\LOC> in my life, before and it used to take six or seven hours to go by train from <LOC>Harrogate<\LOC> to <LOC>London<\LOC> and a friend of my mother’s met me and put me on, I knew that I had to go to <PER>Mill<\PER> <PER>Hill<\PER>. Now <PER>Mill<\PER> <PER>Hill<\PER> was a great big building there, it was going to be the, I think the <ORG>Medical<\ORG> <ORG>Research<\ORG> <ORG>Council<\ORG> were going to use but it was taken over by the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> and that was the <ORG>WREN<\ORG> training and drafting depot and it was a great big tall building, it had a great big, it would have been a car park nowadays in front of it which they called the quarter deck and we had ???? flying from it and if you went across the quarter deck you had to go at the double and we learnt strait away. And then we were given navy blue overalls and we were set to work. Naval history, PT on the roof and don’t forget it was the end of October or something. PT on the roof and it was cold and we thought it was marvellous and we used to be awoken in the morning by a claxon at 5 o’clock and set to work scrubbing. . We still thought it was marvellous! I made friends with a girl from <LOC>Yorkshire<\LOC> as well; <PER>Shelia<\PER> <PER>Tong<\PER> and she said, “This is exciting, isn’t it?” and I said “Yes” and she said “We’re really in the <ORG>Navy<\ORG>!” Anyway we then went for interviews as to what we were going to do and they said “There are only three categories left and that is cooks, stewards or P5.” And we said “What’s P5?” “We can’t tell you,” she just said. Oh that sounds exciting. Seventeen and a half. What is said So we went for the interview for P5. What is it? Can’t tell you.So we said, so then they said to us “Technical or clerical?” and she said, “Well technical sounds more interesting, technical.” OK. Well we were left there another two weeks they were probably doing, checking our background and so on and so forth and we weren’t even given our uniforms. We were then given our uniforms and piled into a bus with our luggage and sent off and wonder where we’re going to. We landed up in <LOC>Eastcote<\LOC> which is a suburb of <LOC>London<\LOC> and it was a great big, a part building site, they were all huts they were already working there and it was one of the <LOC>Bletchley<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC> outstations and why they had outstations was so the only, in the end I think they only made 210 bombes which I’ll explain later the things we were going to operate and they didn’t, if they was bombing they didn’t want them all destroyed so there was some at <LOC>Bletchley<\LOC>, some at <LOC>Stanmore<\LOC>, Eastcote and another one down in the country where we worked in the stables. So that’s where we learnt what we were going to do, in fact. And it was very hard work. Apparently I’ve learnt since they were looking for girls that weren’t less, strong girls that weren’t less than 5ft 6, 5ft 8 in height and I was 5 8 and a half at that age. And it was hard physical work, it really was, you had to learn, what you would do is you’d, you’d get a menu, what they called a menu in, which used to come over a scrambler phone a green phone and according to that that’s how you chose the drums on the front and plugged up the back, it almost impossible to describe, in actual fact, and then you set the thing going. And the plugging up of the back was the most difficult thing of the lot really. You set it going and at the side if that’s, if that was say a machine, at the side there used to be a place where you could, if it stopped you could read off some numbers or letters from there and you would pass that through the hatch to girls who were operating machines that were a bit like the German Enigma machine which checked and it would, either they said job up stroke or they’d say it was a fault and then you’d have to find the, there must have been a short somewhere so you’d have to go through all the little, the drums had little brass brushes behind them and you had to go through those to find the short, you had to take all the plugs out to find the short then start it up again. . But if, in actual fact, they call out if it was right they’d say job up stroke and you’d take the thing down and wait for the next job. And we used to work 8 hours and we’d do a week, a week of days 8 to 4, whatever it was and then a day off and then a week of evenings 4 to midnight and a day off and a week of midnight to 8 in the morning and then we’d get 4 days standoff. It was such a hard job we used to get 4 days after each cycle like that. So I was there for a while, but while I was there there was the mini blitz, the fire blitz in <LOC>London<\LOC> and this particular night we were all, we had huts that were joined together, they were open but they were joined together down the middle, each one had these bunks, you see, down the middle were all the pipes the water pipes and all the rest of it and right at the end was the ablutions for that particular hut and this particular night we were all in bed, <PER>Shelia<\PER> was on the top bunk and I was on the bottom bunk and the siren had gone, I never went in an air raid shelter in my life, in fact, and the siren had gone and then we peeped out through the blackout curtain and a house at the end of the road was on fire, had been hit by, it was empty so it had been hit by incendiary bombs and the next thing we heard was this German aircraft and they did sound different, absolutely different. And it got lower and lower. The next thing we knew “Bang! Crash! Wallop!” and all the rest of it and what they had dropped in the hut, they managed to drop it in between the two blocks, was a Molotov, what we called a Molotov bread basket which was a container full of 800 incendiary bombs and it would open at a certain altitude, but because it was so low it hadn’t opened properly but some of them had burnt their way out of it and down it went and brought the ceiling down. Only, I think in actual fact, it was as close to me as it was to the hedge outside. Our bunk. . But before that happened when we heard the thing coming low, <PER>Shelia<\PER> had leant over to me and said “Let’s get under the bedclothes!” Fine protection, the silly things you say! Anyway, there was silence and then there was the sound of water pouring in and all of the sudden the voice of the other WRENs near us shouting “Abandon ship!” Sounded like one of those war time films! So <PER>Shelia<\PER> clambered out over this thing and all this rubbish and the roof and all the rest of it. Mad, absolutely mad. Well, I laugh when I think, in actual… We had, it was very naval and the chief petty officer, the regulating petty officer, the master of arms was <PER>Golda<\PER> <PER>Bernstein<\PER> and I remember that I was fire watching, when I was in <LOC>Eastcote<\LOC> which meant you had to be there to put out incendiary bombs and all the rest of it and I can remember I used to have to put my hair in curlers because it was long it was sort of page boy, you know, so I had to keep it off my collar and two nights running the siren went and I couldn’t put my curlers in and we had to go and be ready to go and do the thing with the stirrup pump and the third night I thought, I can’t go because it’s going to be on my collar in the morning and division and I would be in trouble. . So I went again and I had to rush up and I put it into curlers and I rushed up to the regulating office and I went to put the tin hat on and it wouldn’t fit over the curlers so I had to take it off and <PER>Golda<\PER> <PER>Bernstein<\PER> said “I hope the <ORG>Luftwaffe<\ORG> will wait whilst <PER>St<\PER> <PER>George<\PER> <PER>York<\PER> takes her curlers out!” Embarrassment, you know, sort of thing. Anyway, the next thing that happened was, I was posted to, um, <PER>Bletchley<\PER> if you like because they had one hut at <LOC>Bletchley<\LOC> which was operating bombes. Now the bombes, I ought to add at this point spelt with an e s on the end of it came from what the Poles who first found an Enigma machine and managed to smuggle it out, it was destined for the <ORG>German<\ORG> <ORG>Embassy<\ORG> in <LOC>Warsaw<\LOC>, they called it a bomber, whatever it was, they managed to get it out and get it to <LOC>Paris<\LOC> and the head of the <LOC>France<\LOC> ???? or whatever it was they got it to the <LOC>UK<\LOC>, but that’s another story. Anyway, off we went and we were billeted in the most gorgeous Elizabethan house it belonged to <PER>Cardinal<\PER> <PER>Wolsey<\PER>, I’ve checked since and it really did! And <PER>Crawley<\PER> <PER>Grange<\PER>, and we used to go to, doing the same shifts we used to taken by bus into <LOC>Bletchley<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC>, never went anywhere near the, I saw the house in the distance the only other thing I can remember is a tennis court with a funny, an American chap who was playing tennis and he had one brown tennis shoe on and one white and he had a sort of bandanna round his head, I’ve never seen a man wearing that before, in my life. And we’d do our shift in the huts and we’d be back to <PER>Crawley<\PER> <PER>Grange<\PER> doing the same shifts. In the scale of the bombe, I mean how big are these individual cylinders and how big is the… Oh, well the machine was over 6 foot, it was over 6 foot. I should have looked at some of my things and seen if I’d got a picture of it. I should think, in actual, it was over 6 foot and it was enormous. I mean if you, it probably was as long as this table and very deep and you pulled out the back and all these great big plugs at the back and there were rows upon rows of these drums, different colours. . I can’t remember, in actual fact, how we knew which colour to use but anyway it used to come out, the most difficult thing of the lot was the menu. First time I’d ever heard that used. The menu was how you plugged up the back, and if you looked at the diagram of a menu it looked like a sort of computerised thing, it was extraordinary. Poor old <PER>Alan<\PER> <PER>Turing<\PER>, baby, the bombs, you know. And how did you, how did you learn it, I mean what was the sort of… Well I had to learn, learn on the job, because it was already operating, you see, at <LOC>Eastcote<\LOC> so we would, we would just double up and learn how to do it. And the sort of messages and stuff that you’re receiving or sending, is it a sender or receiver? Apologies. Is what a sender? Is the bombe…? What’s its actual… What, what it was actually doing was trying to get an “in” into a particular message and if it was, if it was an inside into particular message only the boffins at <LOC>Bletchley<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC> would know they were all sorts of people who could do crosswords puzzles or were chess masters and God only knows what and they could work is what we would get or these menus that the bombe had been working on to try and get that the one thing that would… sometimes it would be quite easy in a sense that the <ORG>German<\ORG> <ORG>Army<\ORG>, apparently were very careless and some young soldier in the field would quite easily use each time as his particular starter thing the name of his girlfriend. Now that would be an immediate in for somebody sitting, some boffin sitting in <LOC>Bletchley<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC> working it out, you know what I mean. But we, this is what we were trying to do. Was an in. . And it’s difficult to explain in fact I hardly understand it myself to certainly when I think about it sometimes. Did you have to sign something; I mean what was the process? Oh, the Official Secrets Act I’ve signed that several times, um, no I mean it was secret, I couldn’t tell my, I couldn’t tell my parents what I was doing. They said if people asked you said you were a clerk and then, or a writer as you would be in naval terms but then people would look and say “Well why haven’t you got your secretariat badge on then?” You kind of, pass it over. You mentioned earlier that you, you know, your father would be like “How do we know where the U-boats are” but you do explain that. So you knew but you couldn’t say, just tell me quickly about that, how you managed your secrets. Well, I can, well, it became second nature in a sense, strangely enough and the emergency of it all. . I’d go home on leave and I can remember very well going to the cinema and my mother used to particularly like the new Movietone news and they’d talk about, sort of, this was early 1944 I think and they’d talk about U-boats being found, wolf packs and so on and so forth found and all the rest of it and I remember my father saying “I wonder how they knew that “ I couldn’t tell him, I knew but I couldn’t tell him. But it became second nature really. What was your feeling about the work? Were you proud? Was it an interesting What is said Well, we felt we were doing a good job and it was monotonous and very very tiring. It was very monotonous. But you knew perfectly, you see, I seem to remember that some of the, that you knew whether it was German army, navy and it would be, it would be sort of “Eagle” or “Porpoise” or “Wolf” or something and I remember, certainly in <LOC>Stanmore<\LOC> I think, it was like that so we’d know, we’d have an idea of whether, we knew what we were doing but we knew no further than that. . And how they managed to keep it secret was everything was in compartments, I mean, we never spoke to anybody in the park. We’d be bust in, done our 8 hour watch and bust out again and we never, we never met anybody there, and the first time I went into the mansion itself was when we went there about 4 years ago with my family. What was it like, I mean if you, it sounds like it was an exhausting job but what was the, sort of Wrenery like that you were in what did you do for socialising? Was there any down time? Did you enjoy yourself? Oh, we did. I mean, when it came to the Bletchley one when we were living in <PER>Crawley<\PER> <PER>Grange<\PER> we only had pass once a week so we’d probably only get out once a week, but we used to do all sorts of things and some people would knit and we’d read a lot and so on and so forth and I remember one night when somebody was having a séance and it was the most, it was very very peculiar in actual fact, I don’t know if you want me to tell you but in actual fact I was reading and this was this beautiful ballroom great big, two big bay windows and ???? it was a gorgeous house not very big. And I was reading and I heard a lot of giggling going on and I looked over and they were at this table with a glass, you know. And who was there? And they said “<PER>George<\PER>s” with an “s” on the end of it like a French George. “What are you? Or who are you ?” And they said “Tutor.” “Where are you?” “Standing beside you.” And the whole thing broke up and hysterics and everything (screaming noise), you know all those. Well one of the girls, in actual fact was engaged to a vicar up in Much Wenlock and she got very friendly with the vicar in the village there and he said “It’s funny that,” because in actual fact <PER>Boswell<\PER> who was the favourite, the court favourite who was given that after <PER>Wolsey<\PER> fell out of favour and apparently, the story went, came home with a young bride and she had a French tutor and in actual fact, she had a baby but the baby disappeared. Was never seen again. . And she was reputed to walk the house looking for the baby and all the rest of it but the interesting sequel to that was there was a small paneled room over the front door, later paneling, I think it was Jacobean and it was a very old Victorian fireplace. A funny fireplace to have and apparently the story was they had dry rot in Victorian times and they had to take some of the panelling out and all the rest, and they found the bones of a baby behind the paneling. I rest my case. I tell you that. I don’t know. I don’t know the answer but I do think it’s just a little… but we used to entertain ourselves. I seem to remember at one point there was, was there an airfield nearby and we had, did we have Americans in, we had a party or something I don’t know, we had very good quarters officer who used to make the most of whatever she had in the way of, um, food and I think when we had a party she used to do things like she’d have a saucer with a candle in the middle and flowers all the way round and you could make, you’d make the most out of anything you could think of. I don’t remember what we actually did, I think once every 3 weeks or whatever we’d go into <LOC>Newport<\LOC> <LOC>Pagnell<\LOC> or <LOC>Bedford<\LOC> or, I can’t remember where it was. Then I was posted to <LOC>Stanmore<\LOC>, another outstation. And I can remember that most because, in actual fact while I was there we, they had Wings For Victory, or something in <LOC>Watford<\LOC> and we were invited to march, to join the march and because we were the only representatives of senior service we had to head it much to the annoyance of the <ORG>RAF<\ORG> and the army. . And, I can remember we had a Royal Marines sergeant from <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> to come and drill us and all the rest of it and I can hear him saying “stone frigate though this may be I’ll ‘ave you girls marching proper!” And we were very proud to do it, in actual fact, but that, at that, we were there when D-Day occurred and I can remember that as well as anything. We had been confined to barracks for about two weeks before, we knew something was up but not what or when and I can remember I was fire watching, I can remember it was a sunny morning the 6th of June and we were fire watching and we’d had a bit of a sleep on mattresses on this concrete corridor and I can remember woken up by the noise of aircraft and going outside and I could see the whole sky was full of aircraft, could hardly put a finger between them. Well then the Doodlebugs started, the flying bombs and I can remember there was another, they were very frightening I must admit, very frightening because you knew when the engine stopped; straight down. They had a Ram Jet I think, so much it would and then down they’d go and hit whoever was underneath the explosive. This particular night the only ones left in our watch I think was <PER>Shelia<\PER> and I because we lived in <LOC>Yorkshire<\LOC> and there wasn’t time, I think we had a short break and there wasn’t time for us to get up to <ORG>Yorkshire<\ORG> so she’d gone down to the Ablutions block which was down this concrete corridor to get washed and I was just about to climb into my bunk when I heard this Doodlebug, very low and very loud and then it stopped. . And I jumped out of my bunk and I ran down that concrete corridor in my bare feet to join <PER>Shelia<\PER> on the floor like this saying to myself, I don’t want to die by myself. And you’d put your hands behind your neck and nothing happened and this is the, one of the only ones it, in actual fact didn’t come straight down it managed to drift and landed about two miles away. You thought that was the end there, What is said Yeah. I also thought, it was, one night we went to the pictures in Ealing and the siren went, this was when the mini blitz was on and we were walking across Ealing Common so we thought we, it might be a good, there was lots of anti-aircraft fires so we thought it would be a good idea to lie down on the grass for a while and there was a gorse bush and there we lay and when we got up about as far as where I am from you there was a great big piece of shrapnel which I had for a long time, I don’t know where it’s gone. Yeah. Because we used to do fire watches it was very important because the idea that you had to put out incendiary bombs because they kept, if they got going they’d put high explosives down on top of it and we did a day’s course in firefighting at <LOC>Bletchley<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC> and the chap that was doing the course was in army uniform but he was, apparently had been “I was a reporter before the war and believe you me I saw some terrible sights after fires. ” Anyway we were shown how to put out petrol fires and all this sort of thing and how you couldn’t spread, how you used foam and all the rest of it but the best of the lot was they had a hut and there was a duckboard and the entrance was there and the exit was there and over in that corner was the, they lit a pile of boiling rags and they had a real blaze going in the corner and then they sent you in there on your stomach with a stirrup pump and all the rest of it and when you got, full of smoke, when you got in there the chap said, “Now stand up.” And that was the best lesson I ever had because people think if you look at a film and you see people with the smoke in a fire they start coughing. You don’t, what happens in fact is exactly like someone put a vacuum cleaner (gasps) and brings every bit of air in your lungs out of it and your soon down on your, flat on your stomach again. If most, terrible feeling, you see people coughing but that’s not true it doesn’t happen like that. It sucks all the air out of you. And this chap said to us, “I’ve see people that have been brought out of fires and believe you me they’re not a pretty sight. .” And we went “Ooohh!” We did a day; it taught me a lot, in actual fact. We did put the fire out incidentally but the standing up was the lesson. Just the heat… Yeah, it’s just as if somebody sucked all the air out of your lungs, instant. Frightening. So then, um, the next thing that happened was we, after D-Day I was posted back, went back to a place called <PER>Steeple<\PER> <PER>Claydon<\PER> in <LOC>Oxfordshire<\LOC> and <PER>Steeple<\PER> <PER>Claydon<\PER> was the home village, I believe of <LOC>Florence<\LOC> <LOC>Nightingale<\LOC> and we lived in a place called “The Camp” it was a Victorian or Edwardian house but apparently it was were <PER>Cromwell<\PER> had camped for the siege of <LOC>Oxford<\LOC> and it was very nice, it looked out over the valley but we used to go in a lorry to work in a stable block. This house I think belonged to a naval commander who, we worked in the stable block and it was, we had five, I think, bombes there, five or six bombes. In all our places we had <ORG>RAF<\ORG> technicians because I believe I heard recently originally they thought, they had <ORG>RAF<\ORG> technicians operating these bombes when it, well “I wonder if women could do it,” sort of thing and that’s where the WRENS came in. . But that was quite, I can remember the technicians room there had guns in it as well because when we were out on our own there we used to, to open, we had an electronic door so if you went across the yard and you were just going to make the tea or the supper or whatever it was, you had to press this thing (knocks) with the V sign and then they’d open the door electronically. So then we were in the stable block. When you say there were five bombes, I mean how many women were on the same shift? Er, you would have double the amount because some would be operating the bombes and some would be operating the checkers. And were they noisy? Very. Very noise (makes clicking noise) yeah, very noisy. ‘Cos, the click, click, click, click, click, they were testing everything and they used to, you know, if you were working you’d go through some of the ones that were on the rack and because, did you ever have <PER>Scalextric<\PER> cars and you know how the brushes always were picking up dust and this sort, well that’s exact, this is, what was at the back of the, the drums and you’d always have into the pair of tweezers cleaning them. . So then I got… So each click is producing a different letter, is Yes, different letter, different letter ‘cos they all the alphabet down the edge of the, edge of the, the drums. Amazing, really. And so each of these drums is clicking away. Well there were a whole lot of them, you’d have red ones there and the next row two lots, I can’t remember how many rows we had. Good many rows. And where’s the signal going into it, I mean, what’s the trigger to make them Electricity. They were electric. Sure but, I mean. Electromechanical, there’s nothing esoteric about them, nothing like computers or anything like that. They were electromechanical. So the menu where are you, where are you working the menu? Is that on the front or the Well you’d be told, I can’t remember how we were told about the drums, the only thing I can remember is that the most difficult part of it was plugging up the back. Where the menu was concerned. ‘Cos it was, to be told how many, it would be easy enough say well you put so many red drums or many, but the complicated thing was the back, the plugging up of the back. So they’d say you know, the menu’s going to be Wolfpack or something and you’ve got to wire up the back properly. Well you got these big, these big plugs to stick in. It’s very difficult to describe, in fact trying to remember it know sometimes I scramble my mind. I was complicated in some ways and yet not in others. It was, it was very monotonous but you had to be meticulous but if you, I think anybody who’d done it would say the plugging up at the back was the worst bit of the lot. So did you, did you ever get a sense of achievement, of what was coming out of Only that the job had come up. From our point of view it then went up to <LOC>Bletchley<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC> on a secure scramble phone then they would start to make sense of it. So if you came up with a short it was like, “Oh no, not again!” you’ve gotta re… Exactly. You’d have to go through and where’s the short is it in the drums or in the… so if it wasn’t the drums it would be the plugs at the back and aahh, you know. And how long would it take to do from the moment you put a menu in to the outcome? I can’t remember, to be perfectly honest. We were at it all the time, all the time, all the time. . We’d have a navy cocoa in the middle of the night, I can always remember that, used to send a spoon up with it, it was great, fantastic! Could you have fun in there? You know, is it… Oh yes, oh yeah, we used to joke and laugh and all the rest of it certainly we did. Certainly we did. And just WRENS or you said you were actually RAF technicians? <ORG>RAF<\ORG> technicians, yes. I can remember one, and he was always, <PER>Jack<\PER>, his name was that was in the, stable block and he always had his tools in a back pocket there, and he always had mug of tea in his hand and he used to say “Jack!” “Yes bud!” uhh, “Yes buddy! Or something. But it, oh we used to have fun, we used to have laughs and all the rest of it and talks. . But once the thing was running there wasn’t anything else to, you’d go through some of the other drums, but then there would be times when you would sit at the machine at the table and have a mug of cocoa or tea or whatever it was. Did you notice that up to D-Day it was busier? No, it was busy. Well I, I only started doing it in October ’43 and I think, in actual fact, it probably that’s why they were recruiting for what they call P5, that is HMS Pembroke 5 and that’s why they were recruiting, I think for that. And I think that’s why, if you were suitable. I’m beginning to think now that when they said there was only a cook, steward or P5 they knew nobody wanted to be a cook or a steward and maybe P5 would attract people, I don’t know. . If you were, providing you were suitable and you passed the, you know, the security thing and all the rest of it. And how long were you at <PER>Steeple<\PER> <PER>Claydon<\PER> Well, I was there, in actual fact, at Steeple <PER>Claydon<\PER> until, I can remember I wasn’t working, I was back at the quarters and I can remember, the war was over and I, we heard bells ringing down in the village and I can remember we all stood there and cried. And then the next day we had to pack up and take ourselves off and I can see us at, was it, not <LOC>Bletchley<\LOC> station, anyway and the train was crowded and we had suitcases and respirator cases and God only knows what and the porter saying “Come on, come on! I don’t know why you girls have got to travel on a day like this!” Do you think we’d travel if ????! Could have hit him! It’s a wonder he didn’t get lynched, in actual fact, and back to <LOC>Stanmore<\LOC> and from then onwards we were dismantling the bombes. Taking them apart. <PER>Churchill<\PER>’s orders apparently. And there was a quote that at one point Churchill had said about the whole operation “The geese that laid the golden egg and never cackled. .” And if anybody, if anybody had told it would have been, that would be, you know. You were getting such cryptic messages, and seeing such cryptic… how did you know what you were doing? Well only on occasion in which we’d hear or be told but generally speaking we were just grinding away, you know. But it, it was important, it seemed important, it was important you got the feeling it was important you know what I mean? It, and people wouldn’t put up with it nowadays, but what you’ve got to put you’re mind-set back into is what it was like during the war, and it was, and we knew perfectly well when you look at a map you see the last back in was this country and everything else was German was Nazi <LOC>Germany<\LOC> and all the rest of it, even <LOC>France<\LOC> had gone and there was this sense of urgency, not panic, urgency that I’ve never felt since. So even though you didn’t really know what you were doing, you were working in a machine that was, you obviously signed the Secrets Act… We knew what it was doing, yeah, that’s right, we knew what it was doing, what it was contributing to, that in fact it was breaking German messages. Was it ever explained to you like Yeah I think so. Once we, once we got into Eastcote with the door shut behind us, sort of thing, yes I think so, yeah. What was your sort of hierarchy, your commanders, like down there what were they like as people to work under in those individual bases? Oh very good. Petty officers, leading WRENs. Petty officer and we had a quarters <ORG>WREN<\ORG> officer but we didn’t, we never had a, I don’t remember a WREN officer being in charge of any one of the watches I think I can remember them being as quarters officers really but we just got on with it, you know, it’s a sort of, it’s very difficult to describe what it was like because you’ve got to look at it in the background of the war and the seriousness of it and what was going to happen if we bloody well didn’t win, you know, and I think people put up with things that they think they wouldn’t put up with nowadays but I think they would if push came to shove. I think it’s something in our nature in this country in particular I think we’re sort of bloody minded I think. I think that’s the only way I can put it. But it was, but it was, it was a great time, in actual fact and it certainly made me grow up. I certainly grew up, very much so, so that when I got demobbed, well I had a period after the Bletchley thing where I was doing aircraft stores on a freight air arms station which I enjoyed and I could see we had one naval officer there he said, “I don’t know, we’ve got these great big stores here and it’s all operated by a crowd of bloody women!” laughing to him, because he was joking, you know, but it’s true it was interesting and you learnt all sorts of new things there, in actual fact. . Were you sad to be demobbed? Yes. I was. I missed it terribly, and that’s why when I trained state registered nurse I joined the <ORG>RAF<\ORG> and I couldn’t join the naval nursing because you had to be 25 to join that and I couldn’t wait but I was back in the <ORG>RAF<\ORG> and I can remember being at <LOC>Halton<\LOC> and course then you’re an officer when you’re in the Princess <PER>Mary<\PER><PER>’<\PER>s <ORG>Royal<\ORG> <ORG>Air<\ORG> <ORG>Force<\ORG> <ORG>Nursing<\ORG> <ORG>Service<\ORG> and you’d have to and we’d do squad drill or something like that and I can see this RAF warrant officer saying to me “When did you learn to march like that?” and I said “In the <ORG>Navy<\ORG>,” and he said “Ugh!” I mean, how do you reflect on being a WREN I mean, how do you, what’s you’re sort of under… … overarching feeling about it now? Well I’m very proud of having served in the WRENs. I’m proud of being a Bletchley. It all seems like a dream now but it’s all sort of come out and poor <PER>Alan<\PER> <PER>Turing<\PER>, you know. Have you met any of them since? You don’t want to or anything? No. I haven’t. Well I think the thing is because we left <LOC>Harrogate<\LOC>, well we, we came from all over the place and I very much regret that <PER>Shelia<\PER> <PER>Tong<\PER> who later married an American war photographer and eventually went to <LOC>Germany<\LOC> and I used to get letters from her and then they went back to the <LOC>States<\LOC> and I’ve never been able to contact her since, which is a pity, because we were great pals. Has your son tried? Oh yes, yes we’ve tried and my, my brother’s worked in <LOC>America<\LOC> for <ORG>BUAC<\ORG> and all sorts of things, you know it’s just, it just doesn’t and he used to work for a magazine called Holiday which doesn’t exist now, but, he was a photographer. That’s a shame, I mean she was obviously a dear pal. Oh really, yes very much so and I can always remember her saying when that German bomb was overhead “Let’s get under the bedclothes!” Which we duly did, you know. End of
 <PER>Norman<\PER> <PER>Alexander<\PER> <PER>Owens<\PER>. That’s my name. I was on HMS Savage, and my rating was <PER>Able<\PER> <PER>Seaman<\PER>, as I finished. I was Ordinary <PER>Seaman<\PER> and Able Seaman. And I was <ORG>Chatham<\ORG> <ORG>Barracks<\ORG> rating. Where do you hail from? Why did you want to join the I came from <PER>Birkenhead<\PER> originally. And I joined the Navy…I don’t know, it just seemed the way things were, at the time, that people joined the different forces they fancied. . And I fancied the <ORG>Navy<\ORG>, and so that was it Where was that? Well, I went to <ORG>Liverpool<\ORG> <ORG>–<\ORG> <ORG>Renshaw<\ORG> <ORG>St<\ORG> . I first went, before I was 18, and they wouldn’t accept me. So they said ’Come back again’ and I went back, and I joined then and everything was alright, then. And, I went down to HMS Ganges. And we done all our training, there. It was very strict, down there- we used to have to go swimming - early morning. Before breakfast we had to go and climb over the mast. There was a great, big mast there. We climbed over it. Every morning before breakfast. In our shorts. (laughs) And then we went to breakfast, then, and got whatever we could and then it was training all day, then. Where is Ganges? <PER>Ipswich<\PER> Had you ever been out of <PER>Birkenhead<\PER>. . at that time? How was all that transition, from being a boy to being a sailor?    I don’t know, really, I think that we just accepted it. Going out of <PER>Birkenhead<\PER> was a big thing, to me, because nobody ever went…travelled far …in those days. So to travel to <ORG>Ipswich<\ORG>! And it took all day. I think it was about 9 o’clock in the morning, to…I think it was 11 o’clock at night, when we got there. Because the train was putting into different stations, and we tried to keep out of the way. There was air-raids going on, sometimes, during the travelling. Yeah, we just accepted things, I think, in those days. . And got on with whatever you had to do. When did you get to <ORG>Port<\ORG> <ORG>Division<\ORG>? Well, you leave the <LOC>Ganges<\LOC> and then you go to… They transfer you to various depots. Seaman’s depots, what we were in. We went to <ORG>Chatham<\ORG> <ORG>Barracks<\ORG> then, as a Seaman. What was <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> like? Oh. They were very strict, there. Oh, that was a terrible place. You couldn’t walk across the parade ground. At any time. You had to walk around it - to get to the other side - you had to walk around. If you walked across, somebody’d shout to you… and then you’d be on jankers, then. I can remember one time. A Petty Officer was marching all the crew, around the outside. And he didn’t salute this Gunnery Officer, that was passing. He should have said-‘Eyes left!’ or ‘’right’, or whatever it was, and saluted him. And he didn’t. And this Gunnery Officer stopped him, and he said “You’ll report, with your crew” he said “ after 4 o’clock, in the gymnasium. And (he said) you’ll be rigged out with…they’ll all have 28 lbs of sand on their backs. . And they’ll be marching for 2 hours” And that’s what he done with us. He had us running and marching for 2 hrs, with 28 lbs of sand on our backs. That was the punishment for that. Just for not saluting. What was the barracks like, as a place? Was it neat and tidy, was it busy? Oh. It was a tidy place, yeah. And, if there was any air-raids you had to go and sleep under tunnels. Which we did, at times. There was big tunnels dug in the side, and we just used to go in there and sleep - wherever you could. . I can’t remember an awful lot about <ORG>Chatham<\ORG> <ORG>Barracks<\ORG>, in a way. What said How did you feel about being a <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> <LOC>Port<\LOC> Division Rating? I suppose I was proud, in one way, to be included in it. I suppose now we are. But at the time it was difficult - with all the disciplines. We weren’t used to that kind of discipline. We were only used to household discipline, type of thing. How long were you at <LOC>Chatham<\LOC>, before being given your ticket? Well, I should have gone to this ship that we were going on, and I was stopped because…. Before I went in the <ORG>Navy<\ORG>, I’d had (erm)…pneumonia. So, when I went in, they’d found this mark on my lungs and that held me back for a while. So I was kept in I was at <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> <LOC>Barracks<\LOC>, for a while until eventually I got this ship then. And then, I was sent up to Newcastle…On my own. I had to find my way with a great, big kit bag and a hammock. . I had to carry these, on and off trains, to get to <ORG>Newcastle<\ORG>. And then, I had to find my way to <LOC>Heburn<\LOC> <LOC>Dock<\LOC> <LOC>Yard<\LOC>, which was further down again - on the Tyne. And I found my way down there. And, it was an Engineer Officer in charge, at the time, there. Because I was one of the 1st ones to go, and report. And he said ”Leave your stuff here” he said “and go find yourself a digs and then come back and take your stuff there” I had to walk around and try and find digs, while we were standing by the ship. What they call ‘victling’- it’s taking stores on. . And just generally tidying the ship getting ready for the main crew. What did you think when you saw the Savage? I don’t know really. I suppose I was amazed at the size of it. It wasn’t very big, but to me it was a big ship, like, you know?.I didn’t realize just how big ships could get until I went on…I just went aboard one of the big ships, somewhere. I think that was in <LOC>Russia<\LOC>. And …erm… oh that’s right we were going to look for bread, in <LOC>Russia<\LOC>. nd went on …- I can’t remember the name of the ship but it was a Cruiser. We got lost on it, trying to find our way to the Galley on it, because they promised to give us a couple of sacks of loaves, which we couldn’t get. Ours had all gone mouldy…. So you were basically one of the first people on this ship, the Savage?    I wouldn’t say the 1st … We....I can’t remember the name of what we were called …We were, like, the first… party to go, waiting for the main party to come. And we had to get all the stores on and get everywhere ready, cleaned down ready for the crew to come. And that was our main job really, as just….. Because, at the time, I was doing the butchering for them. Me, and the Petty Officer. I think he was called the Victling Officer - that meant getting all the stores on, and that was what our job was. Supplying. And then I went, being an Ordinary Seaman, when the main crew came I was put with the main crew then. Just on ordinary jobs - same as anybody else. And what was it like setting sail for the 1st time. Can you remember that? We went out. And it wasn’t very rough, and I was sea-sick then. . And that’s a terrible thing, that is to be sea-sick. For yourself, I mean. You couldn’t care less, what happened to the ship…It was that bad. Then after about a fortnight, I got over that then. It was OK, then - you could stand anything after that. Because we did have some really bad gales - on the way to <LOC>Russia<\LOC>. Can you remember the chronology? What was the first thing you did The first tour, the first operation on Savage Do you remember what as the 1st thing you did? My 1st job was in a magazine, then. Which you went down in the magazine and they’d batten the hatch down on you. And you’d supply the gun with the ammunition then from there. That was my 1st job. And then, after that, I was also a searchlight manipulator. And then I went on a 4.5 gun- on a turret gun, it was. And I was a loader on that. . And , er, you just accepted everything- I suppose- as things went Did you know anything about the Russian convoys, at this time?    You’d hear little things, but you don’t imagine it’s as bad as it is - until you get there. And then, when we did finally did go on one. We went to pick up some empties. What they called ‘empty ships’ but they were full of wood I think, as far as I know. There was plenty of wood in <LOC>Russia<\LOC>, then. Because there was loads of woods there, trees and that. I believe they used to cut those down to build the ships with them. And we brought them back. Any adventures on that trip…Do you remember? I don’t remember much. The only thing that I remember, going in there, it didn’t look very nice from the start. It looked a desolate place. ‘Course there’s a war on, there, and that had a lot to do with it. Did you ever get ashore? Did you go into <LOC>Murmansk<\LOC>? No. We didn’t get to <LOC>Murmansk<\LOC>. We went to <LOC>Poliana<\LOC> , and erm …Archangel. Just little places, we went to. Did you get to shore? We got ashore, there, but you couldn’t go far. They wouldn’t let you go far, anyway. You always had to be standing by the ship, really, in case of air-raids. Because the German airfields weren’t far away, then, in those days. I think they said they were about 20 miles away, then, which wasn’t far. Do you remember any air-raids? Not really…. Not a lot. It was the U-boats that was our main…. ‘Distraction’. They were the worse things. The U-boats. When you were doing the convoys, you did 20. Tell us a little about what it was like to sail in 24 hour darkness, 24 hour sunshine and stuff? We didn’t seem to get much sunshine. It always seemed to be dark, to me.(laughing) Whether that’s just the way it was I don’t know, but….if there was any sunshine, I think it was caused by the Northern Lights - which used to light the convoy up. And that was a bit terrifying because the U-boats could see us, better, then. And that’s when they used to do their attacking, then. When it as nice and light for them, I suppose. What was the role of Savage within the convoy. What was its job?   Well, our job was to go up and down the convoy, trying to keep the U-boats down. And generally just escorting the ships. One particular convoy. We were escorting this Merchant ship. It was SS <PER>Penelope<\PER> <PER>Barker<\PER>, it was called. And we used to go along- beside- each day, and shout instructions to it, to get a move on. . Because it was always lagging behind. And they said they had somebody onboard, who was ill. So our Doctor was shouting instructions, across the tannoy, asking questions what it was and he found out that he must have had appendicitis. So he’s shouting instructions. what to do. And then we carry on. And eventually this ship got sunk. And we went in, to pick the survivors up. And you throw scrambling nets over the side. It’s pretty dark, but you had a little light on you (indicates his jacket lapel). Red light. And people’d go down the scrambling net, to try and help them get in as quick as you can, to get away. And they’re helping them all up as quick as they can. And this one one fellow came up and said, “Where’s your sick bay” and someone told him where it was. ‘I’m the one with appendicitis” and he’s been swimming - from his ship to us, and just casually (laughing) “I’m the one with appendicitis’. And went on his way And then, another one, another survivor, he got hold of the netting - and he wouldn’t let go of it But by then we’d picked up as many as we could and we had to go because we got a ping on the ASDIC to say there’s a U-boat about. So we had to go and he wouldn’t let go of this scrambling net. And he started singing. And of course the speed of us going - and he’s just swinging with it…Banging and singing…. . And eventually he went and then we came back later on to try and pick more survivors up- but we didn’t find any. But the cold’s so severe you don’t last long, anyway. Were you actually involved in helping As many as you can. You always keep one side of the erm, erm, (can’t remember the names of the things) And the other parties go and try and help - to do what they can. How long are you allowed to do this kind of rescue? Well, you do it as quickly as you can, actually. The quicker you can get them on board, the better. Because the quicker you can get away, then. Because the U-boats, sometimes, would hang about. Knowing that someone would come to pick them up. . And they’d sink the ship that’s come to pick them up What said When this <PER>Penelope<\PER> is being hit. Did you see her go down. Was it an explosion…? It’s just a big light, and all on fire, and she went down. And the water’s on fire, because the oil’s on fire. And, these men are trying to swim through it. Oh it’s a terrible sight to see it. It’s still in my mind now. And sometimes you get very upset when you think of it, you know. (Saddened) I suppose it was just a job and you just get on with it. . You’re with all your mates and you’re just trying to push it out of your mind, and go on. What was Savage like, was it a like a happy ship. Did you have a good time? Well it was quite a good ship, I found, and a good crew. I never wanted to leave it. I would be asked to go on a course. But then, if you went on a course, you would leave the ship completely. And I didn’t want to leave it, really. But you don’t know you’re going to do all these convoys, then. You just go where the ship goes. That’s all you’re doing, is following the ship. I guess 1 of the big moments in the Savage’s Convoy experience was the sinking of the Scharnhorst Can you remember what you did personally on that day? What happened was…We were escorting the <ORG>Duke<\ORG> <ORG>of<\ORG> <ORG>York<\ORG>, and a Cruiser. And we were told that the <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> was coming out. We’d had reports to say, off the Norwegian Coast, that she was coming out. And she did come out, then, and…. When you say ‘we were told’. Was your Captain telling you this?    Yeah. We get reports of what’s happening. He said “The <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> is out with 4 Destroyers, and we’re on the look-out for her”. The <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> Is attacking the convoy but the crews with the convoy are keeping the Scharnhorst away from them. And they’re reporting to the <PER>Duke<\PER> <PER>of<\PER> <PER>York<\PER>, who’s in charge of the whole operation, of what’s happening. And eventually, we’re coming up - to attack the <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> then. . But she’s getting away from the escorts of the Convoy, and she’s getting away from them and so we’re trying to pull her into a trap, where the <ORG>Duke<\ORG> <ORG>of<\ORG> <ORG>York<\ORG> would be able to fire on it, which did happen eventually. And the <ORG>Duke<\ORG> <ORG>of<\ORG> <ORG>York<\ORG> sent us to tea early, because she said we’d be approaching the <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> at a certain time. I think it was 6 o’clock, I’m not sure –or, 1800 hours =like- as they say then. So, we had our tea and then we went to action stations, then, and we stopped at action stations until the <ORG>Duke<\ORG> <ORG>of<\ORG> <ORG>York<\ORG> got the <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> on the radar. And she fired the firsts salvo, then, at the <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> And, I didn’t know whether she hit it at first, or whether she straddled it. And then the Scharnhorst started firing back. And my mate on the range finder said ‘Have a look at this’ So I looked through, and I could see the <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> but there was star-shell above it, which was lighting it up. And so, then the <PER>Duke<\PER> <PER>of<\PER> <PER>York<\PER> said ‘she’s getting away from us’. So she sent the 4 destroyers, which was us and the Stored and the Stormrays and the Scorpion and we went in to attack it, then. And 2 Destroyers went down each side of her - firing torpedoes, at it. And we fired our torpedoes. And as we’re going in to fire our torpedoes, the <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> is firing at us. And you could hear the shrapnel on the gun turret. And we went in, and fired our torpedoes. And we came out. And, as we were coming out we went to attack a destroyer, which we thought was a German destroyer. And it happened to be the Stormrays, which had been hit. The <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> had hit her with some fire and we went to attack it. But then we realized what it was, and we helped her to get back, then, into <LOC>Russia<\LOC>. . We escorted her back into <LOC>Russia<\LOC>, then. What’s that noise you talk about? You’re in the turret and obviously you can’t see anything except through the finders. But you could hear the shell, breaking above?    You could hear… One of the after-guns- that was an open gun. And they were firing. And 1 of their crew had his helmet blown off. Which he didn’t know at the time- it just came off. And after we’d finished and come out, he went to look for his tin hat and there was a big hole in it. Something like that, (indicating, a size of it) I think it was. And, I believe he kept that as a souvenir – because the shrapnel must have gone through it, and missed his head and just knocked helmet off. . And he was alright! (Laughs) Did you see the <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> go down? No. I didn’t see that. By then, it was all lit up. It was all on fire and lit up, and gone down. And we came out. I’ve got all the survivors names …. There weren’t many were there? No. I can’t remember how many. I’ve got them, there (indicates beside him), anyway…. What’s the feeling on the ship like, after such a big battle like that? Oh, it was a big relief. Well, I don’t think we realized what we had done, actually . I think you think “Oh we’ve sunk a ship” and that’s it. But, it was a big thing and you just feel a big sense of relief, that she’s gone. Because they only had the Tapit after that, which was a menace to the convoys. Once the <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> had gone, of course we think ‘there’s Destroyers about’, but there weren’t. . They’d gone back in What were you doing, you talk about the view finder. What was your role in all this? What can you hear and whats being told to you? As you’re going in - to fire your torpedoes, they’re telling you the range. The range is coming down all the time “3000 yds. 2500, 2000 yds.” Or whatever it was. I can’t remember the exact words now… It’s coming over, all the time. And we’d stopped firing, because we’d given our position away, you know? You just go in - And fire our torpedoes…. I suppose the men in the torpedo firing parts, were the worse – because they were all in the open. We were not so bad - we were in turrets. Are you firing a gun, or a torpedo? We were firing the guns – 4.5 guns, we had. My job was to load it with cordite. I’d put the cordite in and the next one, to me, he’d turn round and put the shell in. And then we’d push the tray over. And….Just fire it then… What’s the noise and the impact like, then? It was just all excitement, to do… When you’re waiting to fire, that is the worse part. You’re all tensed up and your nerves are going…Everything’s going…Until you fire. And its not too bad after that… … You just keep going Is it loud? No, it’s not too bad, actually. I suppose it was loud ……but we didn’t realize. . Me being deaf, now, I don’t know That maybe to do with the guns….. Have you got any particular memories of the cold, the snow, the ice?    One particular time…. I had 2 pairs of gloves on. And we dashed to action stations. And as we go - to fire - my hand got trapped. Because my hand was that cold - and these gloves on.. And the pressure was pulling my glove off..and I thought it was pulling my hand off, because it was that cold. And I as screaming my head offfrightened, scared stiff. Anyway it pulled the glove off, and I was all right then. . It just damaged my hand a bit But the cold was terrific up there. You couldn’t touch anything metal. You always had to wear gloves, really. And the seas! You can talk about seas all day, but you can’t…. You can’t imagine what it’s like - to climb up a wave, like that, (indicates a steep, vertical climb) like you’re going up a hill. And you see all the convoy. And you go down, and you can’t see a thing. Just like climbing up – I don’t know – like <LOC>Mt<\LOC> <LOC>Everest<\LOC>, I think. Oh. They were terrible seas there. The people that’s been there will be able to tell you this. I’m not exaggerating, at all, on that. But the cold! And the ice! You had to go chipping ice. Every half hour everything that was movable had to be chipped. And, when the bow went down, into the wave- like that (indicates) and the spray had come up…(indicating) … And if you were on the Bridge. .It hit you, like a little piece of… the spray would hit you, like a little piece of ice. That’s how cold it was. By the time it’s left the sea - come up on the Bridge, and hit you - it’s a piece of ice That’s how cold it was. And you go down into your mess deck. to get a warm. And we had a little 1 bar fire like that- an electric fire that had to heat …A big area. And all the deck head was covered in ice, and all along the sides were all wet, with the damp. All your clothes were always wet. . I don’t know how we survived, really How did you stay warm?    You didn’t take your clothes off. When you come off Watch, you just flopped down- on the deck, in the water, anywhere. If there was a table free, you lay down on the table. Or the long stools – you lay on them. Some people said they used to sling hammocks, but we didn’t. Becausehammocks really, then, were made for shoring-up holes. If you were holed the hammocks were a help. Because, the way they were strung, the way you tied your hammock up. That was the reason for it, really, was to plug a hole in the ship’s side. And, the cold though!…. I just can’t get over it, now, how we survived it. Were the heads You’d get washed off those, if you weren’t careful. You had to hang on. (Laughing) You’d get washed, through the....because there wasn’t much stopping you. It was all open. . All your toilets were all open, then, in the after deck So in big seas you had to be very careful? Yeah The water would come over the toilet and wash you off. I suppose it was the first Jacuzzi… Bidet…. You talk about being washed off. Did any of your crew mates ever get washed off? Yeah. There’s one, there, actually (indicates, papers next to him) – he was washed overboard.. There was two. Two of them washed overboard. They tried to make a dash for it, from the after-end, forward. Their duty was up, on the Bridge. They made a dash for it, but they got washed under the guard rail. And one of them hung on to the guard rail… and the other one went. He managed to get up, and get up onto the Bridge and shout ‘man overboard’ But by the time we’d turned around…. It was pitch dark anyway. By the time we’d turned around and went back, there’s no sign of him. So, that’s his Memorial Card, over there. How does that affect the Oh it does affect you. It sets you back a bit. Everyone’s a bit down for a while. Was he a mate of yours? Not a mate. . I knew him, like, but not an actual mate What was your Skipper like? Oh. We had a good Skipper. Well we had a few Skippers- but this one during the <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> battle he was very good. Some of them was…what’s the word for it now? – “knowing” - what crew needs. Whereas some of them would be in pre-war days, still. In discipline. You know, the discipline was very strict on some ships. We weren’t too bad. At sea we could wear anything. Which you did, you wore any old clothes- at sea. As you can tell from some of the photographs I’ve got, at sea. Actually- our main thing was a boilersuit. That seemed to keep you warm, because you were wrapped up in it. The first trip I made, though, we didn’t have any warm clothing. I just had my ordinary dress coat, which we used to go ashore with. That’s all I wore until I got a duffle coat, then, which we used to pass around. . As you come off Watch you swapped it, with someone else to go on Watch with. And then eventually we got duffel coats, then. When you’re doing these legs, obviously your sailing into <LOC>Russia<\LOC>, then you’ve got to do the return leg. Did you have a preference- going <LOC>East<\LOC> or West? Erm? Not really, no. We just didn’t think much about it, at the time. You just done what came your way, type of thing. We just brought empties back. Sometimes we didn’t bring any empties back, we just dashed back again, and picked another convoy up. Because, sometimes they used to run 3 convoys. All the escort would be with the 1st one - and get that into <LOC>Russia<\LOC>. And then they’d all come out and meet the second one, which was already on its way. And then get that in. And that’s how we done it. One after the other. That was near the end of the convoys. Did you ever see any U boats? Sink a U-boat?    No. We didn’t see any. We’d go in to attack U-boat. Many a time, we’d attack them, which we thought were U-boats Drop depth charges…. No. We didn’t see any, but…One of the trips we done was… 2 Destroyers, like us and another one, went dropping depth charges. Every so often, we dropped depth charges. And the Convoy turned off. So the U-boat followed our depth charge noise, for so long. We done this for so many hours, and then we…We had the speed. So we had to dash away, then, and catch up with the Convoy, hoping the U-boats had followed us, away. And, that was one… … 1 good thing we done, I suppose What about Stukka bombers? We weren’t too bad, really. We always had the .. the aircraft used to fly round us, giving…They used to give out signals to the U-boats, as to where we were. They were signaling all the time to them. And, they were signaling the Convoy - and we couldn’t do much about it. Until, one time we had a carrier with us and they sent all the planes off. And as soon as they see the planes coming off, they’d go up into the clouds and go away. And all the aircraft, then, come and land back on the aircraft carrier- except two. And they kept out of the way. Then, as soon as this German plane came back in, they attacked him and shot him down. So that was one good….. Did you watch You can’t really see much, it’s too dark. . Even in the daylight, its dark there, How did you find that sort of 24 hr. darkness? Funnily enough, we used to keep to the time, as well. Can’t remember what you call it now, when you go over the time…You’d have to put… If the time is going ahead 1 hour, we’d have to do half hour on - extra. And the other crew would do half hour coming on. So that’s how we used to catch our hour up, by doing extra time on the Watch. We didn’t think much about it really - the time limit - we just seemed to accept things. I think we were disciplined that much, in those days, you just carried on. What said Did you find that towards the end of the War the convoys got easier? Oh, yeah. They definitely got easier. The first convoys, to go, must have been really bad - especially that PQ17, one. <PER>Jeremy<\PER> <PER>Clarkson<\PER> was telling me about that. I just met him at that ‘do’ there… He was telling me about what he’d done…. So you didn’t do any of the PQ’s then? No, No. The JWs and RAs…We didn’t know what they were called, then. They were just convoys to us. The Morrassa – she got sunk, a Destroyer, with us. We picked up some survivors up off that one. The <PER>Hardy<\PER> was another one. She got sunk. We didn’t pick survivors up off her, somebody else done that. The Lapwing - we picked survivors up off that one. . And she got sunk Did you remember any of these people Were you involved in some of this work? Not really no. . We’d be at action stations and other people would be doing that
 Just tell me a bit about why did you join the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> in the first place? Because I wanted to I’d run away from home and joined the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> when I got to the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> place I was sixteen and I’d been in the Home Guard before that. One of the best shots with a rifle or a machine gun up on the place here. And I run away from home you see and I was a good swimmer and I just to do a lot of high diving in and what have you at the place we had here which is now gone and you know the water drew me somehow. So one night I just packed my kit and left home and I had a bit of a struggle to get into the navy because I wasn’t quite the age they would of liked but, anyway they put me into the <LOC>Ganges<\LOC> and the other lads had just been sent up across the water to the Isle of Man because they were being bombed you see and I was the only one that went in as I were and came out at the end I done well. . I’d been in the <ORG>Home<\ORG> <ORG>Guard<\ORG> as a younger man and done all my machine gunning and bomb throwing in the home guard and course I got a good start on everything. Explosives didn’t bother me or frighten me of nothing. So yeah I enjoyed it, I loved it. And what was it like then <LOC>Ganges<\LOC> why did you enjoy it so much? Well I wasn’t there long because as soon as I got there the first thing you have to do is put a wetsuit on and you have to swim the length of the pond and back and until you can do that and you don’t get away but, I was a good high diver because not far from here there used to be a high diving board and I’m red hot at diving and consequently I was straight out and I had to do a couple of little runs up to <LOC>Scotland<\LOC> and do some work up there with other chaps and one way and another I was seen to be doing jobs on little boats back and forth up to <LOC>Scotland<\LOC>. Several of us was doing it and the next thing I decided I would I was in <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> you see I decided I would study a bit in there, I done all in the Home Guard I’d done all my rifle work and everything and was red hot with machine gun, in Wellingborough and I was a very fit man you know but, anyway after you pass what you want to do when you leave there… … I wanted to be a Torpedoman you see so I joined the Torpedo part and that actually didn’t suit me when I got in there that didn’t but, anyway I got in and got out. And then another chap sat with me we both passed out and went into jobs in the dockyard basically until we got a ship. Is this at <LOC>Chatham<\LOC>?    No this is at… yeah <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> sorry I’m getting mixed up and soon as that happened we messed about a little bit in the dockyard doing work and then the Savage she was down on the where all the trouble was down south she came flying back because she was desperately needed to go up to <LOC>Murmansk<\LOC> run and me and the chap were in there we both went aboard her and got picked up and took her to <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> <ORG>Flow<\ORG> and that was it and of course we done one after the other up there. What do you remember of the Chatham Dockyard what was it like as a place for a young boy? Well I mean I was a young boy and I thought everything was wonderful… actually the first thing I did because the Savage hadn’t come up then she was down just finishing down where the battle was going on and they sent me in the dockyard to do a job until the ship come up you see and I was in that submarine… I had to go in that submarine that was in dry dock that had fooled the Germans and the Spaniards when they put that dead body in the Channel between them… do you remember it. Well they fooled the Germans that it was a German that had been… they actually put a body… they got a dead mans body a genuine dead mans body from up north and they put it into this submarine and they actually dressed it all up… as a man trying to take information to the Spaniards in you know on the coastline. And they sunk it they took this dead body and bound it and done it all made it all look smart in a uniform. Not service uniform but, in clothing and they put a thing on his arm with a great big attaché case with dummy information of what was happening because he was supposed to be a German Spy you see. It’s a film it’s fantastic. . Anyway that little submarine that I had to go and work on had just come back from taking the body and floating it in the Spanish Coastline to drift ashore and they dressed it all up as one of their sort not ours you know and it all worked. What was it like going into the Savage for the first time, you know your first proper draft can you remember?    Well I’ll tell you what it were she was down on the battlefront and she was called away because she was needed for this… and we were down there torpedo course and were having to work in the dockyard during the day time and then vittles in the canteen at night and anyway we got piped for and we both got told to get our kit ready and take it in the dockyard and the Savage came in from being down at the bank where they had been fighting and she’d been pulled right up and they were loading her up with stuff and alongside and we got called and put aboard her and that’s as quick as that but, I’ll tell you what the bloke that was with me he died not about three weeks ago and we’re both together you see and we both took the course together and we both got put on the Savage. She came in, in the afternoon and pulled alongside and god it was murder they were having to do all sorts of things because we’ve got to race up with this big convoy what was coming from <LOC>Canada<\LOC> and already there was loads up in <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Scotland<\LOC> waiting for the convoy to move or… and this well we knew it. . Well anyway they piped for us two and we went on to the window where they tell you where you were going and they sent us straight to the <PER>Savage<\PER> in the dockyard and what the Savage was having to do was take on ammunition and everything else and it was pouring with bloody rain at night it bucketed down and we had to go down further down the coast because we joined it and when we went on we were there forever we’d been drafted to her which was alright. But, we went done to when it got dark… we went down to the ammunition place which was a long way down the water from us and it was bucketing down and god blimey we had an ammunition ship in the dark and it was and you went along this pipe not pipes boards and they were springing up and down carrying stuff out pitch black and this ship was shipping water it was raining so hard anyway we’re all carrying stuff up along the landing you know to fill her up with ammunition and that and we sailed from there at midnight up between <LOC>Ireland<\LOC> and that to join this here big convoy and you’d never see it rain like it god almighty I was a lookout and my mate was on the other side of the bridge in the look out and we was bloody soaked to the skin pitch black and of course we had to put all new ammunition on her before we could sail from there because that was where the ammunition bunkers were down there anyway we got up in the early hours of the morning we reached <LOC>Liverpool<\LOC> that area and then it started to lighted up a bit but, it never left off driving rain and we went right the way up to the <LOC>North<\LOC> where we got to pick this convoy up and they were all more or less ready to sail. It was the biggest convoy of the war. What is said And every type of ship was there and course we joined her and I mean I’ve never been to bloody sea you didn’t know where you were because we hadn’t been trained for it. I thought it was too quick but, anyway we managed alright me and me mate. The first thing were you were all mixed up because the ship shipping water all the way and I went down into the front of the ship and it was half full of water and it was half full of water and it was shipping over the top you see it was one of the worst storms of the war running up that coast and… but, anyway I don’t mind admitting it I felt so bloody sick going up to <LOC>Russia<\LOC> I wasn’t too bad going through the channel as I said but, when we actually got going I thought cor blimey I got billeted they hadn’t got room for us down in the main place and I thought I felt as sick as a dog so I cleared myself and went up and they got the aft gun turret looking forehead so it was open to the direction we were going on the back of the gun shield and it had curtains… heavy curtains that go over because they had no doors or anything behind them and I slept there all night I did… all night <PER>Christ<\PER> I did feel ill and my mate he was somewhere else I don’t know where he went but, I was never sick again. . Well I wasn’t sick I felt sick but, I was never like it again but, I’d always been a good swimmer and everything you know and diver I was good at diving so why that ship upset me like that I didn’t know but, I stopped in there until we got two days away from here as you might say and I never looked back. The <PER>Savage<\PER> was a well-oiled ship she wasn’t got a depth under water like an up and down engine ones she had electric turbines steam turbines made all the electric but she didn’t draw half as much under the water as an ordinary destroyer or and ordinary sloop which was proved on the last day of the war of the convoy and we were all waited outside to go through the mountain gap into the Russian end and a U-boat was waiting for us and we were all there and the convoy was coming in and it’s on the telly sometimes. Convoy was coming in and spreading about but, the Germans were waiting underneath the cliff bottoms and you could only go into the dockyard through and entrance not much wider than that with two great pillars of coastline so you had to go in one at a time and the big liberty ships used to squeeze through it anyway this was the last convoy of the war and we were hanging about there as the ships were coming in with stuff to take in and this u-boat was laying under the rocks opposite us. . It was snowing in the morning when we took up our position to cover them as they come in because they got liberty ships with them you know with railway engines on them and that from <LOC>America<\LOC>. And the first thing that happened one of them got torpedoed as it went to go through the opening into the harbour where you go up further to it because the ship broke in half and sunk in the gateway, well we called it a gateway cause there’s chaos then because the rest of the flotilla… their flotilla and the people we brought up were coming in to this big opening where we were all waiting for the others to go in and we were all ready for everything. . Me and my mate were put down below to push the depth charges up hook them on and then they were pulling them up ready to go. We never heard a torpedo coming or I didn’t but, the others on deck did they could hear it coming but, they didn’t know where it was and it went under the Savage and it hit a brand new ship just as far away as the other side of the road. And everyone was practically killed on it… it sunk like that brand new but, why didn’t it hit the Savage? Shallow draft…? Shallow draft yeah she had flat engines that were driven by shafts that way right at the bottom and they drove these two generators. I used to go down one of my jobs as you go down every morning and check all the things that could of stopped it and make sure everything was alright… that was one of my jobs you see and I used to stand there and watch because what they were there was no propellers what they were on the bigger ships that were right low down weren’t they it was only drawing half as much water as one of them and that torpedo went under us and it hit the other ship on the other side and we picked some of the men up six… we buried one we went in. . we were fighting until dark out there all the rest of the ships and you see this liberty ship they hit it with a torpedo and it blocked the entrance you see and then it went down in the entrance. I mean how do you get rid of that can you remember?    Well I don’t know because it was up to the Russians to do their own work on that. So we were fighting until dark at night and it was snowing at eight in the morning when we started until it got dark and we buried one chap. It was quite dusk getting dark and we buried him and we had to go right up nrth futher to come in another way from the north and down inside the water because we couldn’t get in you see. It was terrible, it was the last convoy of the war and when came out they had opened that up the Russians had. It was Christmas… we had Christmas Day there and we were there for two or three days and when we come out we could come out that way and we came out at midnight two of us and we had to go north run up the coastline and the other one… no we went south and the other one went north listening for UBoats and while we were there we were dropping the convoy was ready to come out empties all ready to come out and we were sent each way us and the other one to keep anything down you see and try and find if anything was there and whilst we were doing this the convoy came out in the pitch black and by the time it got light in the morning they were well away from where we were. . So we had to catch them up you see and which we did and she came home alright never had no problems. After the convoys of the arctic then you didn’t stay on the Savage very long didn’t you? Well I stayed on the Savage until the German surrender and we came back down to <LOC>Chatham<\LOC>, at <ORG>Chatham<\ORG> <ORG>Barracks<\ORG> in the dockyard and I was sent for because as you see I was a volunteer. I joined underage hence it made me a volunteer not a conscripted man we came down to the Chatham Dockyard I got sent to the place added in you in and out and I had to pack my kit and the next morning I was put on a train with hundreds more in the dockyard locked in with keys and they take them out so you can’t get out and this train went straight of flying down to <LOC>Southampton<\LOC> we got out and there was a bloody great liner there waiting for us all full of people going to the <LOC>Far<\LOC> <LOC>East<\LOC> and she was due to sail at half past eight and it was half past six then and you couldn’t get on anywhere for people it was a bloody great American liner, can’t think of the name there was two of them made but, anyway we sailed that night within two hours we were on the water going out and that took us right out to <ORG>Ceylon<\ORG> and that’s where we were took off there. Don’t know where she went from there because she was loaded to the top with… we had to stop before we could go through the Canal to get out to… … because by the time we got there it was pitch black and we went on from there down the next morning through the Canal which was such a big ship and the next thing we went right out to <ORG>Ceylon<\ORG> and that’s when they bumped us off… Was there any… do you remember anything of that troop ship?    There wasn’t no room for us on the top deck and the gale god it blowing a bloody gale and all our kit had been left down below where it had been dumped and there was a load of women on there in uniforms and that and we had to sleep on the open top deck and it was bloody freezing and we went through the Canal. . Went right out and then straight out to <ORG>Ceylon<\ORG> and they dumped us Pretty incredible really when you think you know one minute you’re in <LOC>Polyarny<\LOC> in a battle and then two days later… That’s right that’s how quick it was they were waiting for troops you see and she was full that ship. They had two of them. Did you have any fear of going to the <LOC>Far<\LOC> <LOC>East<\LOC>? No I didn’t know what it was like did I. I mean I had a feeling what it might be like but, I didn’t… I wanted it you see that’s why I runway and joined the navy. I wanted the navy and when that all came well I was on top of the world. She was a nice ship but, I never had done any minesweeping or nothing and she was not a <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> ship you see but, everybody else we got on like a house on fire but, this one bloke and he was in the same mess as me he used to sit opposite me at the table and I don’t know why he took to me but, anyway he found out I was a <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> man and that’s how I think started it. I shouldn’t of been there really but, everybody else we were like bricks together but, he where we used to go down to sleep below if we wasn’t in any danger we used to go down there and down there you’ve got another mess deck and your hammocks down there if you can. And he was in the same mess as me sitting opposite me and he just used to sneer at me and I never had a bloody enemy on that ship and they made me Chief Quartermaster and they didn’t like that you see and that give me quite a run of the ship and then the captain had me up in his cabin and he had a chat with me and he told me what he’d like me to do and it was nice. . I mean I was in charge of the steerage which means the other chaps are under me straight away but, I’ve never steered a bloody ship but, I had to and I mean it hasn’t got a compass like where you see the hands going… you’ve got numbers flicking backward and forwards and you’ve got to read them but, we did have one of the old ones. What about this ship the Japanese ship that you were escorting tell me about that?    Well that was the biggest of their cruisers don’t ask me the name I can’t tell you but, it was the biggest one they had and she’d been bombed and she lay in the harbour and we used go by her every time we went in or out but, we thought she was on the bottom but, she wasn’t but, anyway it was one of the biggest Japanese ships and it had been bombed and it had been in <LOC>Singapore<\LOC> <LOC>Harbour<\LOC> for quite some time since it was his but, anyway unbeknown they were making it ready to tow it and sink it you see and we got chose to do it and we were coming on our way home as it happened. We left <LOC>Singapore<\LOC> a tug with her… two tugs with her actually and she was a massive ship and she’d been emptied and everything and it had got dark and we’re coming up the <LOC>Malacca<\LOC> <LOC>Straits<\LOC> and we got to this point where she was supposed to of been sunk, the deepest water because she was the biggest one they had at the time and consequently it was pitch black and we’re on our way to come home you see. It come to midnight and two Japanese tugs that were towing her, had been towing her right out on… … as far as that big house there from us but, they were coming up the coastline and we were further out where we could keep an eye on her and everything and as I say it got pitch black and by the time we got to the point which we had a compass reading which we’d got to sink her on. They started the ship coming up and left her they bolted and left the ship with no head way and she come half way up to where she was supposed to be sunk and I expect our captain got permission to sink her but, it was midnight pitch black and we had our search light on her and they vanish into the black and gone and of course she’s drifted. Well she wouldn’t drift far you know she’s a massive ship but, she’s only just off the coastline as we saw her pitch black and I’m still on the bloody wheel and of course looking out of the wheelhouse because we weren’t going we were just hovering. And then I suppose the captain got in touch with their people and they said what to do so we had to send men over with depth charges because we carried depth charges and they’ve got to put the depth charges as low as possible in the ship because there is nobody on there and I mean it was massive and they’d got to wire everything up and all we could do was use our depth charges and try them… that’s all we could do. Well we did we did it… it was midnight when we started and we were drifting as far away perhaps as this first house from her and course you couldn’t do much really because our motor boat went over and they put four depth charges in her in the motorboat and that’s all she’d hold you see… carry. And so they took them over from off us it was our crew doing it and whatever they’d done they went aboard the ship and they took the depth charges as the captain said had got to be done and put them right down in the lower end of the ship because I mean she was a bloody massive thing and they did everything they could and fused everything that would explode and came back to us and bang she did, she went down blew the bottom out and she went down but, off course we never see her no more because we left her there but, she wasn’t too far off the coast and she was too far from <LOC>Penang<\LOC>, the ship wasn’t we were going up towards <LOC>Penang<\LOC>. What is said Did you see her going down then? Oh yeah we watched without search light… Bet that was a special thing to see? Well we hung on until we more or less her mast was sticking out but, she’s still going, she was still going down our men put depth charges all the way along so when she got to a certain depth they’d open the bottom of the ship to let the water in as you do and they had to sit there until it filled up and fired these charges and it was bloody you’d never see anything like it… it was fabulous but, of course you wasn’t allowed to have cameras. Just talk a bit about how you would mine sweep the story about what you do and how you do it? Well there is various ways you can do it. You can do it with wires out with floats on well there’s different ways. . You can put depth charges down, put them down to certain depths and leave them down there weighted them down it depends what’s going to be there over them when you come back but, basically you only do it to clear the ocean in the area you were in and if you give ships colliding with them we get sent out there to sweep it. Did you have any near missed with the mines? Well we’ve had them come up beside us yeah a time or two but, when you’re all joined together with great strong wires you’re in a formation like that and each side of it goes out to another ship and then they go out to another one and then out to the other then you’ve got seven but, you’re the one in the front. You’re the one that’s got probably more equipment that you can sound than the others so they do that sort of thing. . They keep improving on certain things and we may have been a little bit better I don’t know but, that’s how you sweep you all over latch each other. You’ve actually got wires holding you together in a position?    No no it’s all done free they had to set one each side of you at a certain distance then vice a versa for the next that’s how you do it. That’s when you do that type of sweep but, there are other ways you can sweep and we used to do sweeps with long wires. We had a great big thing on our quarterdeck and it was full of heavy wire and we used to let that out with things on that and captain on the bridge he’d say let go and he’s stop it when he tells you, it’s a massive sack of wire on a drum and it’s not heavy wire but, you put anything on the end of it and you could let it out and it would explode mines if it finds them if there’s any there, you’ll know where you stand a little bit better. . It’s all done on luck really because you can’t look down in the sea but, we used to snag up on… we snagged up on an airplane down there that had crashed… well we were told it were but, I never seen it but, I know when we snagged it, it got around the ship that it was a plane but, I don’t know how they knew because we didn’t stop but, you always got somebody that made something up didn’t you. You mentioned this about this <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> and <LOC>Pompey<\LOC> Rating when you say he made life difficult what do you mean, how did he do that, what was? Well I’ll tell you what happened we come home to <LOC>England<\LOC> and I had the ??? most of the time because I used to go up and sit with him and then I’d take over because I was responsible for him you see so they didn’t have a long thing I’d just take it you see and help out. And one night when I was doing that I had to be a quartermaster which means when we were at anchor I had to do a duty at the back of the ship where they come in and out of it when they go ashore and one thing and another and all the logbooks there and everything and I was on duty there doing mine and we was almost coming home at this point and I’d got a terrible throat and cold and it was pouring with rain and I had to take the night watch and I thought well I got a cold and I took my oilskins out of my locker because they’d been there since we went abroad I mean you never had them out and I thought god I’m going to go down and get my oilskins and of course I’m standing in an opening because you can go in that side walk straight out and of the ship the other side. And at night time there is an officer and a crew come around the ships and they check if you’re being looked after and that. As I went down to get my… I nipped down because I got the duty watch to get my oil skin out and I got a terrible cold and this chap slung his hammock right across the top of the opening and walk down the step under to there and he’s winging about in his hammock and of course this is one o’clock in the morning and unbeknown to me the boat come around and seen that I wasn’t there but, that didn’t catch nothing but, he told the captain that I had been down the locker and id been having a job to get the thing open because it was all stuck together being in the heat because we never wore them you see there and the next thing he dropped me in it and he told the officer of the day that I was going down to sleep and I’m sitting trying to get this bloody thing open and of course I’ve got a lousy cold and he done that and the next thing he sent for the officer of the day and he come down and put me on a charge, I had to meet the captain and everything and the captain didn’t like it at all… … but, anyway he told me to forget everything he says you’re my man he says never mind about him he said ‘we’ve had trouble with him before’ I brought the ship home right the way up to the dockyard and the next day I come home had three days leave and had to go back down to <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> again because they were demobbing they were all finished you see by then. They never give me a demob suit or nothing so I went to this to see what was happening and they said ‘oh you’re going up to <LOC>Scotland<\LOC> there’s a ship up there you’re going on’ so I said ‘oh yeah how am I going to get there’ he said ‘it’s alright there’s two other chaps coming up with you you’ll all be going together and that was that big ship up there of course she was only on loan during the war you see to us lot because Canadian you see got to go home. I was billeted on her for… they put us on there to sleep and everything quite a few of us and we slept onboard and everything but, by the time they wanted to take her home to <LOC>Canada<\LOC> they sent for me and I went to the office and I had a bit of a problem and I had to see the doctor and the bloody doctor said I wasn’t fit to go so they paid me off the day before it sailed. . And I had to come out the navy I’d got something in the chest and I had to see the doctor and he said you’re not fit enough he said anymore for the navy, cheeky bugger End of
 My name is <PER>Ernest<\PER> <PER>Kellaway<\PER> always known as <PER>Alec<\PER> I am ninety three years old and I served in the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> from February 36 until April 48. Why did you decide you wanted to join the I don’t know… … I just wanted to In 1936 was there any sense that you needed to be joining was there any… Oh no I had a job and I just wanted to join the <ORG>Navy<\ORG>, which was a very good thing worked out very well. Tell me a bit about the process that you went through and where you first I applied through the application to the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> and then I had to go up to <LOC>Southampton<\LOC> to the recruiting office there I had an educational exam then they took us to lunch and in the afternoon we had a medical. At the end of the medical those who were accepted were told so and the others were sent home and we were kept behind told us that we would be sent for on a certain day which was actually the 10th Feb 1936. . Went into barracks there you had eight weeks what they call field training which is all parade work, rifles and everything like that you get used to, then after the eight weeks you then go to your engineering place which was the stokers department and did your eight weeks mechanical training and after that eight weeks you became eligible for being sent around the ships but I had to wait until September before I got sent to H.M.S Hood. So what was it like for you as an eighteen years old to walk up the gangplank on something like H.M. .S Hood? I had been on the Hood two years previously on a visitors day when she was open to the public I had been aboard her but it was strange knowing I was going aboard there to live for a certain amount of time and that’s the only difference and I stayed on there for three years and two months left her just after the war in November as the war started What were your memories of the Well they were great because… we didn’t do much visiting because at that time there was the Spanish wars on, civil war and we were doing what they call none intervention patrols. The Spanish royalists and the rebels with their ships were interfering with merchant ships so we were doing patrols to make certain that they didn’t have a go at us. We did have a bit of an argument at one time we had to go to… we were sent on emergency from <LOC>Gibraltar<\LOC> to go up to <LOC>Bilbao<\LOC>, at <ORG>Bilbao<\ORG> there was a chap… … merchant navy chap there <PER>Potato<\PER> <PER>Jones<\PER> was trying to run into <LOC>Bilbao<\LOC> with his cargo and there was a Spanish battleship there trying to stop him so there was the Hood and us up and down either way and in the end Potato <PER>Jones<\PER> got to where he wanted to. Who was Potato <PER>Jones<\PER>? He was a merchant captain on a merchant ship and he was running a potato that’s why they called him Potato <PER>Jones<\PER>. What was your day to day roll on the Hood at the When I went aboard the Hood she was just commissioning, she just been in for a small refit and she was commissioning so she took a load of people aboard I would say probably about twelve hundred people aboard it at one time and there was so many second class stokers, which is was one of them and normally when you’re a second class stoker you go aboard and you do all the boiler room work, the double bottom tanks that’s the oil tanks and everything they need cleaning and you did all those jobs first but there was so many of us second class stokers that I went in the engine room and from then I was there for a little while then I got working with the Chief ERA of the engine room and then when he got sent home because he was coming up to his twenty two years I got my auxiliary watch keeping certificate. That’s a certificate you have to get by being able to look after all the auxiliary machinery like the dynamos and your evaporators there were… we had reciprocating dynamos, we had turbo dynamos, we had diesel dynamos you had to learn all about these and at the end of that time which would take roughly about six months you got your auxiliary watch keeping certificate your name was then sent to <LOC>Portsmouth<\LOC> barracks and that entered you into the mechanical training establishment which put you through for advancement. . Well after a while I managed to get onto the Captains motorboat as a stoker on his motorboat which was a very good job and I stayed there until I left the Hood in November very good job Just going back a little bit obviously when you joined the Hood she was you know out and about and showing muscle if you like, showing British muscle… Yeah when we went aboard we… I would say approximately three or four weeks we were getting prepared for going out. We went out to <LOC>Mediterranean<\LOC> for three years. What do you recall of the outbreak of war and how did the atmosphere on the ship change? Well there something I could never understand nobody seemed to worry about it. I’ll give you an instance in 1938 the <LOC>Munich<\LOC> Crisis when <PER>Chamberlin<\PER> came back waving this piece of paper now in the <LOC>Mediterranean<\LOC> we had American ships, German ships, Italian ships all on doing this none intervention now the I don’t know whether it was the <PER>Bismarck<\PER> or the <PER>Graf<\PER> <PER>Spee<\PER> all of a sudden she disappeared from the <LOC>Mediterranean<\LOC> well then they sent the Hood out to see because the crisis was there and anything could have happened and for several days we were more or less shadowing her so if the war had started we would have been right in top of her because in those days you could do that you didn’t have radar or anything but you could do it by radio signals. Well then the crisis was called off we go back into <LOC>Gibraltar<\LOC> and a little later I don’t know if it was Deutschland or the <PER>Graf<\PER> <PER>Spee<\PER> one of them pocket battleships came back into <LOC>Gibraltar<\LOC> and we were unfortunate that when we tying up on the mooring in <LOC>Gibraltar<\LOC> a wire parted and killed two of our crew one marine and one seaman. . And then we held a football match and the proceeds from the football match went to the dependants and that match was between the German ship and the Hood and a few days earlier we would have been trying to blow each other out of the water and yet three days later we were playing a game of football and actually we beat them three nil. Did you play? . So that was just after the outbreak of war? That was 1938 crisis… ok… which was a very memorial time with that… with <PER>Chamberlin<\PER> with his piece of paper… piece in our time which didn’t work out. Well from then on we carried on with our time in the <LOC>Mediterranean<\LOC> we came home in January 39 and they had to do some repair work on her and I would say probably about September we set sail from <LOC>Pompey<\LOC> just before the war started. Did you have an inkling was there a sense that war was about too break? Well yeah because you know you had this propaganda going around you know from the press and that and everybody was getting trained up… about three days before the Hood… before the war started the Hood went to sea to do a full… … what they call a full calibre gun shoot training so when they did that we used to leave motorboats in because they should have been back the same night but she didn’t come back for three days and we was stranded in <LOC>Scapa<\LOC> <LOC>Flow<\LOC> but we managed to get some food from the salvage people who were salvaging the ships from world war one and then we went aboard the <PER>Iron<\PER> <PER>Duke<\PER> for a couple of days until the Hood come back in and then we went out to whatever we did do you know. Just before I left we unfortunately got bombed they split a few plates on the ship side but nothing disastrous Was that aerial bombardment? … Where were you, were you below decks at that point? Oh yeah I would be below decks most time, most of my time in the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> whenever you were In action was mostly below deck the only time I wasn’t below deck was when I was on the motor launches and I had a dual purpose job then but that should come later, but then we came back into <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> and they said to me you go to go into barracks and do your mechanical training course and I left her then… I don’t think I saw her ever again until… … well I didn’t see her but I heard about her being sunk How did you feel when you heard that having spent three good years on Well it’s something that’s very awkward to describe really because you have this feeling you now of such a lovely ship like that and so many crew that you know… … but I had mates that were left on there that went down with her so you know you had this feeling about it because that was the first time really that death had come to us in that way I mean it’s an amazing stroke of fortune isn’t it that you were sent off just before she set sail for Well no I left her in November 40 and she didn’t get sunk until May 41 I’d left my second ship then H.M.S Cossack I joined her in April 14 and left her in April 41because I got rated up and there was one to many of the rates so they sent me off. But what happened after you done the mechanical coarse and I mean what were you learning on that, why was that a good move for It was a good move because it was your ladder to promotion as PO your name got in there and then you did your training so I went to sea in the Cossack as a stoker I hadn’t been there very long and I got made up leading stoker I left her as leading stoker and went to my next boat and I was on there and I was made a PO so a mechanical course was a great asset to me What was it like going to <PER>Cossack<\PER> and how did that compare and what were your thoughts about the Cossack? Well the Cossack… I picked the Cossack up she’d come back from The Second Battle Of <LOC>Narvik<\LOC> and she’d been hit about four times by German shells and she was in a bad way, she had quite a few killed on there and fortunately for me she went into dock in <LOC>Southampton<\LOC> for repairs and I lived in <LOC>Eastleigh<\LOC> which is very good for me but that was a good point about it but there is a difference because you come down from a thousand four hundred crew to about a hundred and eighty the whole amount of them will be about a hundred and eighty so it was a different atmosphere all over because your more integrated because there were chaps on the hood that I never even knew the <PER>Nobby<\PER> <PER>Clark<\PER> was a stoker with me on the Hood, I didn’t even know him he was there at the same time as me, I never knew him I never met him until I joined the Hood association but destroyers to me were the main thing in those days, to be on a destroyer, it was great. Why did you have that sense of satisfaction? I think the thing is you mingled with lots of people, when you’re on the Hood the most people you mingled with were stokers but on the Cossack was:- you had stokers you had seaman, you had telegraphists and god knows what and you more or less met them individually whereas on the Hood you wouldn’t meet them at all Where did you go with the Cossack? Well we were on <LOC>Atlantic<\LOC> convoys, we did do three of the Tribal boats from <LOC>Rosyth<\LOC> which our captain was the senior man, we attacked a German convoy over at <LOC>Ebro<\LOC> light in <LOC>Norway<\LOC> an action that took about twenty odd minutes and the convoy and its two escorts were gone lost three boats very superior boats they were. What do you remember of that action? Nothing much… most of my time when there was action on destroyers and the Hood I was always down below. On the <ORG>Cossack<\ORG> you worked in three watches so if you were on watch you were in the engine room, if action stations were done you’d try and change over you’d come out the engine room and you went down the forehead boiler room to man the compressors and longest of watch you went to the steering gear in the tiller flat where you had dual system if anything went wrong you changed over from one system to another and I had just been relieved by leading stoker <PER>Woods<\PER> and he’d gone to the phone ( pair of earphones like you) picked them up like that… … contacted the bridge leading stoker <PER>Woods<\PER> just relieved leading stoker <PER>Kellaway<\PER> and a bit of shrapnel came through the ships side and he was a very big hefty chap and it split is arm right down to the bone there as it came through the side, so that could have been me but it wasn’t it was stoker <PER>Woods<\PER>. Did he survive? Oh yes he survived yes… Is there any sense that you were in a battle even below decks… … as far below deck as you were? The only thing I remember while on the destroyers and that. When I was on the launchers and that it was a different matter. When I was in the tiller flat the after twin 47 was above me and you could hear them firing and doing what they had to do, which you know you were down there on your own you locked in… more or less locked in because they watertight compartments so your doors locked not locked it’s clipped but that was a feeling you know you heard the guns going off that a… … you know what’s happening. I noticed from your notes that one of the sort of big, almost continual issues that you had to deal with were the mountainous seas… … oh defiantly were there any that you recall any particular events? One special one, which was Christmas Day, which would have been 1940 we had been ordered out from <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> on some mission or other and when we got outside it was a blinder the seas were mountainous and somebody sent down to the mess stores are ready so you had a galvanised tin about that size, about that wide, about that deep which you went up and got your tea, sugar and tins of milk. Well I went up and got these because we had all new stokers called up for the war and you know some of them were real seasick. . Well I came down and as I got down the ladder me first foot on the ladder she was bouncing a lot at the time and I said to the lads below, I said steady me which normally the other chaps that knew the job would have got hold of my backside ease me down and all of a sudden the ship went up and down I was thrown up and this metal container comes down the side of my nose and split it down there had to go into sick bay and have it stitched up. That was a moment… momentous moment. Did you ever get seasick or did you have good sea I had very good seasick but the very funny thing is about it is when I was waiting for my commission first commission on the Hood you fell in outside the regulating office and the ???? came out there and chopped you off you there, you there , you there somewhere else and he came to us two chaps and he said go and get your overalls and go round to the lorry park and they’ll take you down the docks you’ve got to take a destroyer to sea for the day. So we get down the docks I think the boat was the Ambuscade she was doing torpedo runs for the torpedo school so I go aboard there and I got straight thee and had to go down the boiler room and I was down there until twelve o’clock and I came up and by that… just after that about two o’clock the destroyer came back into harbour and we went back into <PER>Pompey<\PER> ok so get in the mess were in about six o’clock mealed up so I helped we all mucked in and served it out and that I’m sat down at the table and this is honest, sat down at a table like that there’s a long table holds about eight or nine each side and I was sat down there and that table come up to me like that… that’s the only time I had any feeling about the sea… … seasick in the barracks you wouldn’t believe it would you. Yeah just sat down there and that (demonstrates table up and down) but in my mind it did. I had just been rated up to leading stoker and they had one too many so they sent me back to barracks and when I got back to barracks I was drafted too motor launches these were very versatile boats they could be used for torpedo boats, submarine chasers, used for secret service dropping spies everywhere, they weighed about sixty four ton, they had a crew of about two officers and about ten men and I got drafted to them. . Well when the Hood was sunk I was in Esher doing a high speed engine course for these boats at a place called there <PER>Railton<\PER> <PER>Cars<\PER> and if you go back in history <PER>Railtons<\PER> were racing cars.   Did you say <PER>Esher<\PER>? Esher In <ORG>Surrey<\ORG>? Yeah they had this big place where they designed engines for cars and that <ORG>Railton<\ORG> <ORG>Cars<\ORG> and that’s when I heard about the Hood. Well I left there went back to barracks and the next thing is I’m on my way up to <LOC>Fort<\LOC> <LOC>William<\LOC> and we had to do a fortnights course on these motor launches where we were more or less given instruction on everybody’s job so if any of the crew got injured up top someone else could step in like a seaman could nip down below, I couldn’t nip up and do some of their job and from there we went down to <LOC>Brixham<\LOC>, yeah about ten of us and from <LOC>Brixham<\LOC> we went up to <LOC>Appledore<\LOC> <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Devon<\LOC> and we picked up a ML 279 and when we saw her on the slips there, she’d just been finished off she had a copper bottom we told us we were going abroad somewhere. So we took her up <LOC>West<\LOC> <LOC>Africa<\LOC> and we were running up and down the coast there <ORG>Bathurst<\ORG>, <LOC>Freetown<\LOC>, <LOC>Takoradi<\LOC> one trip we did to <LOC>Liberia<\LOC> which was the original place where the <LOC>Negros<\LOC> went when they were liberated we stayed there for about ten days well I had two boats there because I got made a PO and I went then in charge of the engine department on 209 What was it like to have gone from you know something as big as the Hood to the Cossack to a such a small crew I mean you know how did you adapt and how were you put with the The thing is that you when you were in barracks or a large ship everything was done for you in the line of cooking and catering and that as soon as you went aboard a destroyer you prepared the food and the cook cooked it for you, quite a difference and then when you went aboard these small boats you had to rely on one of your mates to be able to cook if not you were in a bad way for meals. We did a when we left the shipyard from <ORG>Plymouth<\ORG> we went up to <LOC>Londonderry<\LOC> and from <LOC>Londonderry<\LOC> it took us nearly seven days to get to <LOC>Gibraltar<\LOC> there was four of us boats and two flower class boats they were bigger than us and they were are escorts to <LOC>Gibraltar<\LOC> What was it like crossing the <LOC>Bay<\LOC> <LOC>of<\LOC> <LOC>Biscay<\LOC> in something that We could only use one engine, we didn’t carry enough fuel to go all the way normally a day trip to… from <LOC>England<\LOC> to <LOC>Gibraltar<\LOC> three days but because you had to do a detour to evade the German forces it took near enough seven days. . Well we had one thousand four hundred and fifty gallon of petrol tanks in our main tanks and they put five tanks on deck with five hundred gallons in each and as you went through the normal tank you drained the others into the main tanks so you had these five just ordinary steel tanks on deck with five hundred gallons of fuel in them Did you… … I take it that you didn’t encounter any Germans or anything because I mean that sort of boat your pretty much a sitting duck aren’t you? Oh you are… the only thing you got in your favour that your very small in the water which is quite a good thing you know. A young man from <LOC>Eastleigh<\LOC> you’ve travelled a little bit but you’ve never been to <LOC>Africa<\LOC> what was it like going to <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Africa<\LOC> for the first time… … what do you recall of <LOC>Africa<\LOC>? I went to <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Africa<\LOC> actually when I was on the Hood my first trip abroad from the Hood was in <LOC>Tangiers<\LOC> and then we went round to <LOC>Oran<\LOC> and various places so we got… but when we went to <LOC>Bathurst<\LOC> and <LOC>Freetown<\LOC> it was so primitive there you know they had little tin huts anything was chucked up somewhere they could live you know. Ok and then so when you were down there you went to 279 just talk through a bit about that please? Well I had been rated PO and our skipper came aboard one day and he said I got a job for you if you’ll take it will you take over engine staff at 279 there mechanic wants to go ashore I said that’s ok with me you know gave me an extra shilling a day which was quite a lot of money then I was only on about seven shillings a week, seven shillings a day at that time so that gave me another shilling another… no one and sixpence, one and sixpence charge money. . When I went aboard 279 we did several trips up and down the coast there. What we normally did we just took one ship that one ship kept in close to the coast and we kept on the outside of it and we did submarine sweeps all the time you know. Well then I got called back to barracks, but before I got into <LOC>Pompey<\LOC> barracks they sent us to <LOC>Portland<\LOC> to the small ships base and the engineer said he said you are not going to barracks I need you for boats here and he kept us there and I got drafted to ML 100 which was one of the first MLs built the only difference was she was more or less a flat bottom boat and she had three engines where the other boats only had two and she was a minelayer so we used to carry these mines, six mines we used to carry like a torpedo shape mine we just dropped them over the side get to a specific point and lay them and we used to drop them, well I managed all there time I did about ten trips with them. . Well sometimes we used to go up ???? River that’s when we carried the pimple mines we carried eight of those so we’d go up the river and on the way out we’d lay our mines so we weren’t being worried about anybody chasing us because they’d run into our mines. Do you ever remember even in <LOC>Africa<\LOC> as well any particular incident where there was any kind of contact or memorable moments? No there was nothing… nothing special at all there our biggest problem was that we had engine troubles break down of engine, which was a hell of a job. We had one problem there when we used to go along side these big tankers for fuel well when the tanker was empty it used to fill up with water, its tanks up with water then go down to <LOC>South<\LOC> <LOC>Africa<\LOC> way pump all the water out and fill up with fuel, would be oil fuel, petrol and various things well then we found we were getting this… we were steaming along one day and all of a sudden the engine cut out and what was happening we still had water in our petrol, which was quite a big job because once your engine stopped you changed over to your auxiliary filter started the other engine up but then you had to get the other engine prepared and if you can think of standing on top of an aircraft type of engine because you got six cylinders either side and you’ve got a manifold that runs through the middle of it about that long with three carburettors underneath it and you got to stand on top of this engine and take this off hell of a job it was, but it was a good job very interesting.  And this is out at sea is it? … So the boats tossing about in the surf? Yeah… when you’re going down the <LOC>African<\LOC> <LOC>Coast<\LOC> the sea is coming in that way all the time so your boat is more or less doing that… it’s not doing that… it’s doing that (indicates the way the ship is moving) so you just fancy standing on top of this engine one foot on either set of pistons or the covers of the pistons and taking this manifold off because you got to get the carburettors out to drain the water out but another problem we had was that the engine room… the engine oil that we was getting out there was very weak and if you didn’t watch out, the system was at the top of the cam shaft each end you had two little oil pumps… petrol pumps and they were a vein type of motor which if you remember the Wankel engine as it goes around so these two pieces come in and out causes suction and discharge they were fitted on the end of cam shafts now they ran at ten pound per square inch and the oil pressure ran at forty pound per square inch but with the oil being a poor quality that it had no body and the petrol would leak from the pump along the cam shaft and go down in the sump of the engine and if you didn’t watch it but to long you had say you got that much of oil there… you had about that much on with water and that and ML 301 she actually blew up and they put that down to the fact she got water in and the engine more or less stalled and started and blew up and they lost the boat… the boat was lost because there only made of wood you only had to have a slightest fire there… they were dangerous but on ML100 I had a good job there because I had a leading stoker and two stokers well they used to man the engine room and I had to do whatever the skipper wanted if I wanted down the engine room I went down there and had a look at those things but I would lay a smoke screen we had a chemical… I forget the name of it but on the stern of the ML we had this like a little drum about that size about that round and you had an air vessel up by the bridge so you went down and opened up the valve on the cylinder then opened up the air pressure blew this chemical out and as soon as it hit the water you got a big smoke screen and we were always laying a smoke screen because of the German E-Boats we were in roughly a thousand yards of E-Boats, we could picked them up at a thousand yards with our radar but if they got inside that thousand yards we didn’t know where they were you had to rely on visibility people being able to look at them and pick them out. Climate wise and that whole lifestyle of being on one of something like 109s and what have you to then go and see the Skate I mean that must have been a bit of a come Well with the MLs and that it was very good because you only had twelve crew two officers so you mixed well you learnt about each other’s job. I had a stoker <PER>Jimmy<\PER> <PER>James<\PER> who came from <LOC>Salisbury<\LOC> he was a better telegraphist than the telegraphist was the telegraphist on small boats he used to be more or less look after the two officers, the officers fed off the same food as us it was his job to make certain they got their food, keep their cabin clear. . Everybody worked together I used to work with the skipper and he used to get me on the bridge and have me take noon day sights so if anything went wrong I could always navigate the boat Were you disappointed to leave the Yes I was really because they were great you know because you were so friendly it was just like you and I talking together there’s twelve of you there which was ML100 there was only four in engine department but then you had your gunners you had your ASDIC rating you had a telegraphist you know very friendly and the officers were… … they were not naval trained they were civilians who had university degrees probably amateur yachtsmen they were all well to do people my skipper <PER>Booth<\PER> on my first boat <PER>Dennis<\PER> <PER>Booth<\PER> he was the son of Booth Brothers Shipping Line he was a good skipper very nice, very nice it was a totally different life altogether So then I came off there and went to the Skate well your back then to naval routine well I managed to stay on her until she had to be scraped then I picked up <LOC>H.M<\LOC>. .S <PER>Loch<\PER> <PER>Tarbert<\PER> What year was I can’t quite remember the date of that but it was before VE Day that was what forty five wasn’t it so I would say late 44 Where did you go after the… Well after that I got… … the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> said these Po’s are gonna come back What year is this by the I left the ML’s September 43 I got back into barracks I had about a week’s leave I went back of leave and I was sent up to <PER>Hull<\PER> to pick up H.M.S Skate she was 1916 she weighed about nine hundred tons she was one of the smallest destroyers we had she was built for <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Sea<\LOC> work but they had converted her into an escort vessel they’d taken her torpedo tubes out and a couple of guns then fitted her up with depth charges so we could do escort duties. Well the first job we did was we went round to <PER>Loch<\PER> <PER>Ewe<\PER> and we did two Arctic convoys from there and then we were doing running between <LOC>Londonderry<\LOC> and <LOC>Iceland<\LOC> taking military stuff up like… you had this I think it was Empress of <LOC>Canada<\LOC> she took all the Canadians up there and of course we had Canadian troops in <LOC>Iceland<\LOC> during the war in case there was any invasion well we were… we came back into <LOC>Londonderry<\LOC> and we were told we had to go down to <LOC>Plymouth<\LOC> well on the way down we passed through… we were in <LOC>London<\LOC> we were going over by <LOC>Scotland<\LOC> and as we got near one of the Lochs we were told we had to go in there and do an exercise with submarines, they were training new captains for submarines so they had three of us boats and we were running down the loch quite a speed and we were the last one and this submarine had to come up astern of us and use its sounding gear to find out where we was and it had to come up astern of us instead of that it came up right up under our props so we then had to, we damaged her conning tower and everything so two boats were more or less out of action so they then sent us round to <LOC>Barrow<\LOC> for docking it was a lame duck escorting a lame duck the submarine went into one dock and we went in the other and we had to have two new shafts, two new Did your captain get into trouble for … well I don’t know that, it wouldn’t be him it would be the training commander on the submarine I just want to go back a little bit actually Alec… what was it like having you know spent a year or so whatever that was down in <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Africa<\LOC> having not been in <LOC>England<\LOC> for a while to come back and find <LOC>Britain<\LOC> in 43 when you were on leave do you recollect that… what was it… … was it a different place? It was defiantly a different place because my wife and I we managed to get up to <LOC>London<\LOC> for a couple of days I had seen the bombing in <LOC>Pompey<\LOC> and that and <ORG>Plymouth<\ORG> but when I got to <LOC>London<\LOC> it was devastating to see the amount of damage that had been done by the bombs and that. Did you see any Battle of <LOC>Britain<\LOC> while you were in <LOC>London<\LOC> at that point? No… I was on leave from the Cossack that’s it we got to go back again now. I was on leave from the Cossack and I was going back on a Sunday evening when the first planes bombed <LOC>London<\LOC> and we got as far as <PER>Clapham<\PER> <PER>Junction<\PER> as trains were stopped we were taken off, put on buses and taken round to King’s Cross where we needed to because the Cossack was in dry dock in <LOC>Edinburgh<\LOC> so we had to go to King’s Cross we were then put in air raid shelters and that because there was bombing going on but we just mingled in with the crowd you know and they didn’t seem to worry about it… they must of worried about it but they didn’t show it you know there was no panic or anything like that Another thing I was just curious to hear you were married at this point you know how was it being away from your wife for such long periods of Well I was… really when you look at it I was very fortunate when it came to leave I finished my mechanical training then I got married well the first boat I picked up was the Cossack and she was in dock for a couple of months because she’d been so heavily hit by the German shells so I had a couple of months there and then we went to sea and you went to sea in any weather you know if the weather was bad in normal times they say well we won’t do this exercise we don’t want to damage the ship but you had to go to sea so a destroyer used to take a lot of hammering and that meant she had to keep going in dry dock so when she got in dry dock you might be in there for a fortnight so you got leave for each watch, week for each watch and this went on all the time even when I was on the Skate we had this because if you read my story of the Skate it’s a wonder she stay afloat What ship were you on and what were your recollections of D-Day? I was on the Skate at D-Day and as I say we went out the day before we then had to abandon that exercise we went back to <LOC>Plymouth<\LOC> we fuelled up and everything and we didn’t go to sea on D-Day but we went too sea the next day. . When we got over the coast there <LOC>Normandy<\LOC> <LOC>Coast<\LOC> there was a Canadian plane that got shot down and were trying to pick the crew up and as soon as we got near them there rowing away in their dingy until we could make them understand we were British very funny thing that was… yeah… What was your recollection were you on deck at all on D-Day did you get to see anything? No… most of my time was always down below… … you see you would be at action stations until you left the area so I would either be down the a… … well my action station was forehead damage control or on watch in the boiler room What happened to the Skate just after D-Day you split the side or something? Yes we went out to the <LOC>Atlantic<\LOC> to relieve these Americans that had brought this convoy over and we brought them in and I’m on watch down the aft boiler room and I’m just doing a walk around to see everything’s alright and I got behind the fans that were supplying air to the boilers and I got cold water on my neck and I thought cold water in a boiler room impossible and when I looked up there was a very thin spray of water coming through the ships side like that you couldn’t see the gash but there was a thin spray of water coming through so I rang up the engine room and told the engineer in charge there they sent somebody over to have a look we then went into <LOC>Plymouth<\LOC> and no not to <ORG>Plymouth<\ORG> sorry… … into <LOC>Falmouth<\LOC> they put a concrete patch over that, they built a frame filled it up with concrete that stopped the leak We then went round to <LOC>Devonport<\LOC> and as we were going in through the boom they signalled us to say your degaussing gear is not working it was a good job there were no magnetic mines about. . What had happened water had come over that and got into this motor and it wasn’t working properly so we then went alongside a cruiser there The <PER>Black<\PER> <PER>Prince<\PER> and we tied up alongside her and as we tied up one of our steam pipes burst and of course were chucking out <PER>black<\PER> smoke then everywhere and this skipper comes along you ought to of heard what he said about this because we were making the Black Prince black Was the split a consequence of activity on D-Day? It’s what they said it was crystallisation of the steel so they then towed us up to… into the dock itself and by the time we got there we had raised steam again and we went along side this tug, there was a tug there and she just had a refit and she had brand new paint and everything and my steam injector that had never worked before worked and it pulled all this oil out, dirty oil water out of the bilges and straight over the ship never seen anything like it. . So then they moved us round somewhere else in the end they said to us sorry everybody’s got to leave the ship she’s going to be scraped and that’s when I picked up the <PER>Loch<\PER> <PER>Tarbert<\PER> then Were you sad to leave the Skate? Yes she was a nice boat I had some good mates on there that’s the main thing… … very good mates With the Skate after you had the incident with the sub on a couple of the Arctic convoys wasn’t there fires that nearly sank the ship and stuff… … wasn’t there incidents of fire and other incidents? Oh yeah… we had fires on the Skate… which we had… if there was a thing that went wrong it went wrong on the Skate she was so old she should have been scraped when they took the guns out and the torpedo tubes they had to put ballast in the ship so in the boiler rooms underneath the boilers they put in these big cast iron ingots about that long about that shape about that long but they never cleaned the bilges out so as soon as we got to sea the oil that was in the bilges floated on any water that was there and there was about that much difference between the bottom of a boiler now you’re looking at a boiler that’s the size of this room and underneath that which is quite an area you got these ingots there and this oil that’s floating across and the heat from the boilers set them alight we had fires there which we had to see to, we had problems with the fresh water where she was so weak that the oil was running into the fresh water tanks and the water was running into the oil tanks it got to a state there once that our two senior PO’s asked permission to see the captain and they brought it up about the state of the ship and they put us in dock in <LOC>Londonderry<\LOC> for a couple of days or so and tried to do something about it… … tanks but it didn’t work we still had that problem water in the oil and oil in the water always had this problem. As soon as we were free we used to come in from having a convoy into from the <LOC>Atlantic<\LOC> the American ones we used to pick them up and bring them into <LOC>Portsmouth<\LOC> area and we go in fuel up store up and we’d be back out again straight away you know. That’s a point actually we haven’t touched upon that… what do you recollect about the convoys… … and the Arctic convoy was to <LOC>Iceland<\LOC> yeah and obviously the <LOC>Atlantic<\LOC> was to <LOC>Canada<\LOC> or <LOC>America<\LOC> but you never did the Russian convoys or anything like that? I did two Russian convoys but not all the way the Skate was so small that she never had the fuel she only… I think she carried about four hundred ton of fuel she was very good she was very fast boat she could do thirty six knots you think that she weighed nine hundred ton and thirty six knots she could do. What was it like being onboard when she was doing that were you ever on deck when she did that sort of speed? No… mostly if she was doing that speed I’d be down the boiler room. That’s a very quick boat isn’t … when you look at the Cossack the Cossack was a thousand eight hundred ton well the Skate was nine hundred ton And so yeah just what’s your recollection of any of the convoys that you did and the sight you know what you saw in these convoys? Well the thing was that… Were you ever worried about U-Boats as Well we had that we always had U-Boat trouble you know when you came off watch and you went to your hammock for sleep and that you were already ready so you got straight out if the alarms went you didn’t have to dress or anything you were already dressed for that, but you know you get an alarm go off and everybody would dash to their respective stations and then they be dropping depth charges or whatever you had against them Did you ever see a U-Boat? Not until after the war… no not after no… … not until VE Day and we had to go and round them up in the <LOC>Atlantic<\LOC> and bring them in what was left of them because by that time the German U-Boats were in a very bad state they had lost seven hundred boats Ok so after the Skate what happened Well then I went up to <ORG>Ayr<\ORG> and <PER>Troon<\PER> and picked up a brand new frigate H.M. S <PER>Loch<\PER> <PER>Tarbert<\PER> we commissioned her we went round took her round to <LOC>Tobermory<\LOC> were they had an admiral there who was still specific training for escort vessels and then we joined the <LOC>Atlantic<\LOC> convoys again and we were in <LOC>Liverpool<\LOC> coming from sea we were in <LOC>Liverpool<\LOC> when VE Day came now the <PER>Loch<\PER> <PER>Tarbert<\PER> was a brand new ship she was prefabricated pieces were built everywhere and then shipped up to Troon and then they built put it down the dock and welded them together but we had a problem with her that we always had the port engine always run a bearing and these bearings were quite big there about that wide and that size you know were the shaft went through because they were reciprocating engines, they weren’t turbines like the other ships were these were reciprocating and we always ran bearings no matter how we turned soon as we turned as soon as we got up to a certain speed we ran a bearing What does ran a bearing Well it’s when the metal goes inside the bearing you got… there white metal lined and the friction and that… that used to go in the bearing then which slap so it’s like well you can fancy it couldn’t you… every time we got back in harbour people came aboard our people mixed with them we done the bearings putting in new linings and various gods no what and we kept this up for… till we got to <LOC>Malta<\LOC> we left <ORG>Liverpool<\ORG> and we got to <LOC>Gibraltar<\LOC> and the bearings had gone again we got round to <LOC>Malta<\LOC> bearings had gone again and this Maltese engineer came aboard he was going to do the repairs and he’s having a good look around and he said that engines out of line you got your pistons… … your pistons the engine I suppose was about from the window to about here and nearly as high reciprocating engine and the piston were each were a separate piston and what had happened they hadn’t been lined up properly so every time we went to sea and you started doing a little bit of speed so you got this trouble and it took that Maltese chap to realise that problem was there we never run a bearing after that. What was it… … <LOC>Malta<\LOC> was after VE Day was it? Yeah we were on our way out to the <LOC>Far<\LOC> <LOC>East<\LOC> then. What was… … what do you remember of VE Day? VE Day well we were in <LOC>Liverpool<\LOC> at that time and it was hell to play in the evening one thing that a… … really I don’t think you should record this actually the British soldiers were having a go at the <ORG>Yankee<\ORG> soldiers they were as soon as they got some beer in them they were fighting like hell which was sad but everybody was so happy you know everybody was cheerful and that Can you remember how you Oh felt well you know because that part of the war had finished and we hadn’t been a… … about a day later we were outside rounding up these German U-Boats bringing them in What was your recollection of seeing a U-Boat for the first time… … it must have been a bizarre sight I mean you know? Well the thing is with a U-Boat your used to your own submarines yourself there was no effect on you that way except they were painted in German colours because we operated in the Med before the war with submarines we had a big flotilla of submarines at that time so submarines were part and parcel part of everyday life really Did you meet any of the… … you know the German crew? No some of our chaps did because they had to go as boarding party you know. .   So you stayed on after the war? Yeah from… … Was that all part of your plan because you joined before the war? Well I had twelve years to do I’d signed on for twelve years but on the <PER>Loch<\PER> <PER>Tarbert<\PER> when we were in <LOC>Liverpool<\LOC> after VE Day one day we went out for and exercise with one of the monitors that’s these heavy gun… they carry two heavy guns fifteen inch guns and there good for going up rivers and we had to go out and do an exercise with her and we crewed up in <LOC>Gibraltar<\LOC> then we crewed up in <LOC>Malta<\LOC> then we crewed up in <PER>Alexandra<\PER> and then we were out in the Far East then we were operating from <LOC>Trincomalee<\LOC> which was then <ORG>Ceylon<\ORG> and the day the Japanese chucked in we were outside with the fleet cos we were an escort vessel, we were outside with the fleet they were going to invade <LOC>Singapore<\LOC>, but that day the Japs chucked in so that was ok. So we had more celebrations And then after that we went down we were called in an emergency to go too <LOC>Indonesia<\LOC> because the Indonesians were fighting the Dutch so we had to go down there and see to it and we took a I think it was Ghurkha regiment down with us because these rebels had taken over the airport and everything and we were down there for several days the <PER>Ghurkhas<\PER> went out did their job they got the airport back and while we were tied up alongside the jetty in <LOC>Surabaya<\LOC> we were continually getting shelled by mortars but fortunately none of them hit us at all Do you remember <LOC>Indonesia<\LOC>? Not a lot but I was the chief stokers handyman I was his upper deck stoker PO, what they called them and anything that happened I had to do he would say to me we got this to do and that and one day these mortars came over about two hundred yards from us and they landed in a pile of raw rubber and they set this rubber on fire and I was sent out with a crowd of blokes to put the fire out well we had… … there was no means there we couldn’t get any water and that so all we did was went round this pile of rubber and dug this earth up and chucked it on the top and when we left about four days later it was still smouldering but it wasn’t burning Yeah the Indonesians were having a go at the Dutch they didn’t want the Dutch back. I had to go in the dockyard one day I forget it was… is this <LOC>Surabaya<\LOC>? This was in Surabaya and when I came back to the ship there was crowds and crowds of women and kids around the boat and they were the women from the local village and what had happened when the Japs arrived there they took the men away and put them in camps for work and left the women in the village and they said you look after us and you’ll be alright so you had young Japanese children and that and all these women and that and they came down the boat for safety well we had to provide them with food well the skipper had a bath so our chaps got round they scrubbed this bath out they got a steam jet put it in the bath and filled it up with tins of veg and that and made a big stew for these people and the two cooks baked bread and that so we catered for them for about three days and then a landing craft came in from <LOC>Singapore<\LOC> and took them all away That must have been a special experience for Yeah… it was to see all… when I come back walking along there gets inside the ship there all these women and that. . There were Dutch, Indonesian mixed race and that and a lot of the women there had small Japanese babies well they had no option if they didn’t toe the line they got no food What was your feeling towards inverted commas the enemy by this point? Well it’s very funny you know when you look at things you got to go back to the <LOC>Munich<\LOC> <LOC>Crisis<\LOC> there we were two ships which would if the crisis had come into war we would have been fighting each other two days later we were playing football with them. There’s a friendship in the sea that you don’t get with the <ORG>Army<\ORG> of the <ORG>Air<\ORG> <ORG>Force<\ORG> there’s such a comradeship between all nations at sea. . I would say you sink a ship like the <PER>Bismarck<\PER>, when the <PER>Bismarck<\PER> went down there was a lot of men in the water I think the Dorsetshire I think sunk her they went around picking up survivors until they got a submarine scare and then they just vanished and that’s why they lost so many of the crew there, they actually had a crew over two thousand and only two hundred were saved (actual figures 2,200 men, only 114 survived) she was a massive ship Was she bigger than the Yes she was bigger than the Hood and… I don’t know what her actual tonnage was but she was bigger than the Hood. . The Hood weighed forty four thousand tons so I would say the <PER>Bismarck<\PER> must have been around sixty thousand tons So after <PER>Loch<\PER> <PER>Tarbert<\PER> were you back to the <LOC>UK<\LOC> We finished out the <LOC>Far<\LOC> <LOC>East<\LOC> then after a while we with the state of our boat, they were built for long journeys out to the <LOC>Far<\LOC> <LOC>East<\LOC> using the experience the Americans were had to during the war we used their experience we built the ship and you carried a lot of fuel and then when the fuel was being used up you had ballast tanks which you filled with salt water well one day I had to go aft they wanted the ballast tank I couldn’t get the valve to open I managed to get in the tank itself had somebody come along I went down with a face mask on with a long hose up into the fresh air and couldn’t free the valve at all so that meant to say that tank was useless then so that’s the first thing that went wrong. No ballast tanks and we were doing a harbour duties and they had one dynamo running, we had no auxiliary dynamo we had just two steam dynamos so you always had to have steam in the ship and this steam dynamo which was a reciprocating engine something went wrong with the electrical side and the governor went on the steam side and the two of them working against each other they snapped that shaft off… … that shaft was about that round and it sheared it off so we were down then to one dynamo so after a while they said well get her back to <LOC>England<\LOC> scrap her, which they did do and she was only what… eighteen month old and she was useless So then I come back to <LOC>England<\LOC> I was sent back to barracks and a little while later I got a draft chit to <ORG>H.M.S<\ORG> <ORG>Concord<\ORG> she was a new… she was a war destroyer being finished off she was one of the last it had been built in <LOC>Woolston<\LOC> in <LOC>Southampton<\LOC> which did me very well living in <LOC>Eastleigh<\LOC> and then we went out to the <LOC>Far<\LOC> <LOC>East<\LOC> not much trouble there we had… we were more or less stopping drug runners and various things and we went up the <LOC>Yangtze<\LOC> and on the way back from the <LOC>Yangtze<\LOC> we went to <LOC>Hong<\LOC> <LOC>Kong<\LOC> and I was fuelling the forehead tanks and an officer sent for me and he said or a message came you got to see the officer so and so I got to him he said I’d like you to pack your bags and that go over to the cox aid you got a steamer back to <LOC>England<\LOC>, and I said well what if I want to sign on he said you’ll have to do that when you get there so I steamed the cox aid back out to <LOC>England<\LOC> from then on I had my leave and left the <ORG>Navy<\ORG>. How was that… … how was that leaving the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> after all that time? Well it was awkward but I had a young family and I thought I’d sooner have time with them than being around at sea I couldn’t get any higher than I was I got… … I was a chief at the time Did it take some adapting? Well not really because I had… … I was on leave from the 27 th of December until about the 12th of April I was on leave they owed me so much leave What was it like though you know it’s almost ten years you dabbled in <LOC>England<\LOC> but it’s been a long time since you lived in <LOC>England<\LOC> how different was Well I think the thing that helped me was the fact I had the wife and the children my mother and stepfather lived locally you know and I just blended in with them. My whole nature is I can blend in with anybody even today I you know I’m getting about I look after the club here and various things if anybody needs help I’m there and I’m the second oldest chap here… second oldest person here You don’t strike me as a man with high stress levels? No… That’s what you need to be on a boat isn’t it… Lord <LOC>West<\LOC> was saying that to us actually that you don’t what big personalities necessarily you want people that are you know… … fly below the radar get on with everybody? You got to be able to adapt yourself and when you get on ships and that you got a different thing altogether it’s a different life from one ship to the other it’s totally different because the attitude of the people. . The Hood was an exceptionally happy ship there’s no doubt about it she was a great ship we were on her at the wrong time Spanish war we never went past <LOC>Greece<\LOC> when we were out there our run was between <LOC>Greece<\LOC> and <LOC>Gibraltar<\LOC> we managed to get home for the coronation 1937 then we went back to the Med End of
 My name’s <PER>Irene<\PER> <PER>Bellamy<\PER>. <PER>Irene<\PER>, just… Where are you from? I was from <LOC>Bristol<\LOC>. From the fishponds area… where I was born. And I went to school in <LOC>Bristol<\LOC>. And started my work, after school, in <LOC>Bristol<\LOC>. How old were you when war broke out? Umm, well, I was born in 1919, so I was twenty. What was life like for you in <LOC>Bristol<\LOC>, I mean, just tell me a bit about your schooling and just life in <LOC>Bristol<\LOC>, so I understand who you are? Umm, I originally went to a small private school, umm, and then went to coleston from there and umm, it… <LOC>Bristol<\LOC> itself I found rather dull, you know. It was all pubs and churches. That’s how it seemed to me, you know, there weren’t the lovely, fun things that there are for young people today. We spent most of our time either going to, our free time going to the cinema, or playing some kind of games, you know, I belonged to various hockey teams and tennis clubs. And, umm, during the war, umm, of course we worked very long hours, umm, and late so you weren’t looking for much leisure fun. And I moved because of the <ORG>Bristol<\ORG> <ORG>Blitz<\ORG>, during that time. . Umm, I was put up by the firm, they didn’t want us in the danger of central <LOC>Bristol<\LOC> and so on, and so they took over a cottage in Chipping Sodbury, and I lived in Chipping Sodbury, for a couple of years. That was quite good fun, actually, the sort of village life – lots going on. But I’d always had a yearning to go into the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> when the war broke out. Mainly ‘cause I had friends who had joined the services. Was it… Was it WRNS over any other service? Yeah, I didn’t want to join… Do you mean… … err? <ORG>WAAF<\ORG> or ATS or anything? No, no, no. My particular friend went into the <ORG>WAAF<\ORG> and she had a very interesting time as… out in <LOC>Washington<\LOC>, err, working for the Naval… not Naval, the air force. The WRNS was the right choice then?   Yes, yes. . Liked the uniform too! Yeah. Just tell me a bit about <PER>Yate<\PER> and what you were doing there and the… the work and stuff? Umm, well as secretary to the chief designer in the beginning, it was a question of doing typing. He would dictate his design, umm, reports, ‘cause it all had to go up to the air ministry for approval, err, ‘cause they were looking for a, umm, an order for these planes of course, and it was typing all these sheets of description of these planes. . Umm, and that, I mean to say he was a very un-disciplined man in that he left everything to the last minute, so one was working quite late at night, very often, to get it done to the deadline that the ministry had set. What was his name? <PER>Basil<\PER> <PER>Henderson<\PER>. And he designed the small plane called the umm, what did they call it? Umm... The Hendy… It was a breakdown of his name. But it was Basil Hen… It’ll come to me, but it was round about the time that there was umm, another chap designing those small planes, umm, I can’t think of his name now. But that would have been in about 1937/38. Did you have a sense that war was coming? Umm, not really no, I mean to say the boys that we used to meet and mix with were mostly umm, air force types, or going… interested in the air force and we knew they… It was the 501 squadron, the… at <LOC>Filton<\LOC>, umm, that most of them flew with. Umm, and we knew at times that… from their conversation that things were getting very near. . But, umm, not really, you know we weren’t putting up the barricades or anything! What about the outbreak of war, do you remember that? I do, we were actually on <LOC>Filton<\LOC> aerodrome when it… that Sunday when they announced it, watching these lads in their planes taking off, purely for exercise. So did things change in <LOC>Bristol<\LOC>, when war broke out? What was the change, do you remember? I can’t honestly say because most of my life was spent between Fishponds and <PER>Yate<\PER>, you know, I very rarely went the other way towards town, and didn’t really get any feeling of what things were like. Even, you know, I read now about some of the ghastly things that happened in the bombing, you know, the loss of life. But it didn’t affect me directly. . Umm, my parents had a shop in Fishponds and they still kept going, you know, in a quiet sort of way. What is said Did you see the Blitz? Did you see… were you in… were you in <ORG>Yate<\ORG> when it happened? Yeas, I was in <ORG>Yate<\ORG>, yeah. And that was one of the reasons why the firm moved us, to live in <PER>Yate<\PER>, so we didn’t have the business of travelling, umm, but we did have a daylight raid in <PER>Yate<\PER> and that was very traumatic. There was… they sent a single plane, I mean we were all working away quite happily and the air-raid siren went, and err, I was being taught how to play bridge, by the friend who went into the air force, and umm, we didn’t take any notice of the air-raid siren because we never had anything and suddenly there was the most almighty explosion, and the whole building shook. What had happened, a single plane had come in, apparently it came in from somewhere in the northern <LOC>France<\LOC> area where the German’s had, umm, airports, and it had flown up the <LOC>Bristol<\LOC> channel to somewhere north of <LOC>Gloucester<\LOC>, picked up the railway line and <ORG>Yate<\ORG> runs along the railway line, you know, the building, and flew down and dropped this strip of bombs along the factory. Fortunately a couple of them didn’t go off and I think it was about fifty seven people were killed, and it was my first experience of seeing a dead body, because I knew most of the people in the factory because of who I was working for and one of the other people living in the house in Chipping Sodbury was a woman called Sister <PER>Hobbs<\PER> who became quite well known for the work she did in that <PER>Blitz<\PER>. . And she just caught hold of me and she said ‘come on, we’ve got to go up to the brick factory’ she said, to identify these people who’ve been killed. And you know, I was taken, but also I… it was 1941, so I was 22. At 22 to see all these disintegrated bodies, and I hadn’t seen a dead body before, and that was very traumatic. Yeah, was that, do you think, a catalyst for thinking I want to join… become a WRN then? No, I don’t think so, no. No, that was quietly simmering away. And, I think the catalyst in the end was when my boss moved. He went to a firm, which again you may know of, <LOC>Boosey<\LOC> and <PER>Hawkes<\PER>. They, umm, he wasn’t a musician or he hadn’t made musical instruments ‘cause that was the job they did, originally, they were making spare parts for some of our gun turrets. . And they, umm, found that he was a man who could design what they wanted. And umm, they got him, they head hunted him, and when he left, I wasn’t too happy with the person who got the job and I thought I want to move. But I had to work quite hard to get into the WRNS because, of course, I was in a reserved occupation. I was going to ask was it a… I assumed it was a reserved occupation, so you had to go through the procedure to get out?    Yes. And there weren’t… the WRNS weren’t open for recruitment anyhow. And at that time we were being, umm, drawn, I suppose is the word, for a… the… by a war artist. A man called <PER>Leopold<\PER> <PER>Freedman<\PER>, who I haven’t been able to run to earth since, I have tried, because he did like a mural of people working in the factory and it went to the, umm, National Art… What’s the one in <LOC>Trafalgar<\LOC> <LOC>Square<\LOC>? <ORG>National<\ORG> <ORG>Art<\ORG> <ORG>Gallery<\ORG> in <LOC>Trafalgar<\LOC> <LOC>Square<\LOC>, umm, and I was sitting, you know, while he was drawing me and talking to him and I said I wanted to join the <ORG>WRNS<\ORG>, the problem was there were no vacancies and I was in a reserved occupation. So he gave me the name of a woman, again, I’ve forgotten her name, but she was the head of the <ORG>Ministry<\ORG> <ORG>of<\ORG> <ORG>Labour<\ORG> in <LOC>London<\LOC>, so I go off to <LOC>London<\LOC> to see this woman and she told me the sort of inside secret that I ought to be able to get in fairly soon because the WRNS were expanding and they expanded very rapidly and I got in very easily then. But I had to wait ‘til the doors opened. Of course the Lords of the Admiralty didn’t want women. . You know, they reluctantly took them in at the beginning of the war, but, you know, it was a man’s service. It wasn’t for women. Brilliant. So what was the process then from… transitioning from being a secretary in <ORG>Yate<\ORG> to becoming a Wren? What do you remember of it? Yeah, I remember, err, you know, having my papers and being sent to <ORG>Leeds<\ORG> because… because they suddenly expanded, err, they had to open new training depots. I was in my early twenties and, umm, I had what they call a white paper, umm, which was a recommendation for a commission as soon as you were interviewed originally, you know. Most girls have to wait and work a while, but I was older and I think they saw me as a possible admin officer, well they did actually. But then I went from <ORG>Leeds<\ORG> after I did my basic training to <LOC>Rochester<\LOC>, which is really in the <LOC>Chatham<\LOC>. Now I had seen myself as boats crew, you know, because I was a Bristolian I wanted to go to <ORG>Plymouth<\ORG>, which was the uh… But the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> had other ideas, so they sent me to be… to go to training for an admin officer at <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> really. Anyhow, I… they put me in what’s called the regulating office, which is, you know, where you monitor people coming in and going out and telephones. And, umm, I always remember that the first officer, who was the one in charge, was a very, very jolly woman, umm, and she was the daughter of somebody called Lady <PER>Burtonshaw<\PER>? who lived in <LOC>Hove<\LOC> and every Saturday afternoon Lady <PER>Burtonshaw<\PER> would ring up her daughter, just for a chat and I was put on the telephone. Well, I’d never, never worked at a… you know those plug in telephones, I’d never worked one of those, and of course <PER>Lady<\PER> <PER>Burtonshaw<\PER> comes through and I was a… panic, you know, I wasn’t very confident about it. Of course what do I do in the very middle of their conversation, I pull the plug out, you see. So I had to go in, she called me in and she said ‘who was on the telephone’, so I said’ It was me ma’am’, so she said ‘You are nothing but a broken reed’. . And I thought, well nobody’s ever called me a broken reed before! But you know, it did me the world of good. I thought I was God’s gift to the <ORG>Navy<\ORG>, you see, and I wasn’t at all! But that remark, really has stuck with me all my life. What is said Were you, excuse me for asking, were you a <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> rating? Yes. Okay. I suppose I was. Nor?? command, it was. Did you go to <LOC>Chatham<\LOC>? Well, not… only in sort of… to visit because we were billeted in <LOC>Rochester<\LOC>. And because I was doing the admin work in the office, the office was attached to the billet. How did you find moving ‘round the country? Had you been out of <LOC>Bristol<\LOC> at this point? Umm, I… not very far, no. That was another thing, you didn’t travel far, you know, holidays were… well the furthest we went was Tenby, in south <LOC>Wales<\LOC>. But I had been to <LOC>London<\LOC>, umm, and I had been to <LOC>France<\LOC> on a school trip, umm, once. But no, not very far. We weren’t very well off anyhow as a family, you know, we had to cut our corners. So after <LOC>Rochester<\LOC> then, where did you… where did you go then? Well, when I was at <LOC>Rochester<\LOC>, the first officer, I was telling you called me a ‘broken reed’, umm, I was in the… what do they call it now? Sort of, the office which allocated postings to the girls, ‘cause all the girls there were waiting to be sent somewhere, umm, and I was there, and nothing came in, ‘cause I was looking through all the different things that came in from the Admiralty and nothing came in I was interested in. I was down for admin and then I found that to do admin I had to go to, umm, Lowestoft, to the Captain’s office where they trained admin officers. And I found that there was a long waiting list, and I thought, ‘well I didn’t join the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> to sit in an office and wait for that’. So I was given the opportunity to go and I said no, so they said ‘well you realise you’ll go to the bottom of the list’. I said ‘well, I didn’t join to have a commission anyhow, you know, I joined to do a job’. So she said to me if you see anything coming through, umm, it was a teleprinter in those days, let me know and I’ll see, I said well, all I know is I don’t want to work in <LOC>London<\LOC>, I don’t mind where else I go and, you know, I’d like to stick with my shorthand and sort of general office work. Okay, she said, so… in comes…    It was at the time when General <PER>Eisenhower<\PER> was, umm, getting to be quite well known as a commander and he set up, if you remember, SHAEF, and I looked it… and I… something came in with ANCXF/SHAEF, and I thought ‘well, that’s interesting’ and at the ANCXF was the Allied Naval Commander Expeditionary force and that was Admiral <PER>Ramsey<\PER>. And I thought, ‘well that sounds interesting’, you know, so I went to her and I said could I have my name put up for that vacancy. And so she agreed and, you know, you had to take your chance what other applications they had and, umm, I got it! And I said where is it? So she said, well to start with you’ll have to go to <LOC>Norfolk<\LOC> <LOC>Square<\LOC> in <LOC>London<\LOC>, which is the headquarters of SHAEF, and the ANCXF group were collecting there, umm, and they were mostly WRNS who were going to do the D-Day planning. But I got… because I put in for ANCXF/SHAEF I got attached to the… this is where Admiral <PER>Parry<\PER> came in, to Admiral <PER>Parry<\PER> who, typically British, we hadn’t started D-Day but they were always… already post-operative planning! And I couldn’t believe this, I thought, well we haven’t won the war, why are they planning for the future? You see, and that’s what I was caught up in then, from then on. I was attached to him and sent to <LOC>Bushy<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC> in <LOC>Hertfordshire<\LOC>. Not <LOC>Hertfordshire<\LOC>, umm, it’s near <LOC>Hampton<\LOC> <LOC>Court<\LOC> <LOC>Palace<\LOC>. And it was General <PER>Eisenhower<\PER>’s headquarters for… … they were collecting all the more administrative people there, you know, while the troops were being collected around <LOC>Kent<\LOC> and <ORG>Sussex<\ORG> and places. Sorry, it’s me nerves! You’re doing brilliantly. It’s amazing, trust me, don’t worry. Umm, and I thought, oh I don’t want to go to <LOC>London<\LOC>, but anyhow, in the end they said well you’ll only be hold… held there until umm, and I was only held there a day. I remember sitting on the wall outside <LOC>Norfolk<\LOC> <LOC>House<\LOC>, which is where the <LOC>London<\LOC> group were and told to wait and somebody would pick me up ‘cause from then on it became highly secretive. . And I was sitting like a lonely <PER>Wren<\PER> with my naval case and nothing else and a jeep came zooming round the square and an American stopped by me and he said ‘are you WRN <PER>Irene<\PER> <PER>Ballamy<\PER> goin’ to <LOC>Bushy<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC>?’ Well, I said ‘I don’t know where I’m going, I’ve just been told to sit on this wall!’ So he said… he got me aboard his jeep and we went through that bit It wasn’t far from <LOC>Norfolk<\LOC> to get out of <LOC>London<\LOC>, went to <LOC>Bushy<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC>. Bet that was a fun journey! And of course, when I get to <LOC>Bushy<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC> I’m the only <PER>Wren<\PER> there, because it was a separate unit to the big group that were at <ORG>Norfolk<\ORG> <ORG>House<\ORG>. What year was that? Err, be 44, I think, 44/45. What is said I mean, just describe the set up at <LOC>Bushy<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC> and what you were doing there before D-Day? Well, <LOC>Bushy<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC>, umm, is… I presume it’s a sort of local… it’s a very large park and in it were porta cabins in which, by then you’d got the British and the French, err, and Americans. Who were the fourth ones? Not the… Canadians? No, yes, well there were a few but not many. I was thinking of the group that they split <LOC>Germany<\LOC> up into regions, didn’t they, there was the British… Russian? Russian. But I can’t remember Russians being at <LOC>Bushy<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC>, I think they linked up later. Umm, but I remember being in one of these… we had our office and this is where… I didn’t actually, couldn’t say I met him, but the doodlebugs had started flying and, umm, we… they’d got… they had <LOC>Bushy<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC> in their sights and they got very near us, but so there were air raid shelters built specially and a lot of the Americans, particularly the women in the American army had never experienced anything like it before – they just went to pieces if there was an air raid! They were a terribly nervous lot. But I quite enjoyed being with them because it was a different lifestyle altogether. Their method and the equipment they gave us, you know and the hygiene was put in. So I was really… I was under air… umm, ATS supervision, err and somebody called Lady <PER>Brecknock<\PER>? I think she became quite a power in the Land afterwards from a political point of view, but she was in charge of us and she… and I resented her because she… she used to open my post, which of course the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> never opened your post, but because I was under ATS rule, all our post was opened. . Umm, and <PER>Lady<\PER> <PER>Brecknock<\PER> always made a point of reading and remembering what was in them and I was always sending home for money! And err, she was always saying you know, ‘you don’t need money, you’ve got plenty, you know, you should manage on what you’ve got.’ And that was seven and six a week. So from there… Did you meet <PER>Eisenhower<\PER>? Well, yes and no. I was talking about the Doodlebugs, umm, and if he was on sight, umm, in his office, he didn’t come very often ‘cause of course the… his responsibility was enormous and the places, you know, people said ‘oh <PER>Eisenhower<\PER> was there’ but they were never there for long. Umm, but he did use the air raid shelter, which was the same shelter that we used because we were in the joining offices. . Umm, but you know, he hardly saw us, because he’d pop down and all his entourage would be with him. Err, but, I mean to say we didn’t feel we were lesser than him, you know, he always had a word to say, but you can’t really say you met him, you know. When did Admiral <PER>Parry<\PER> come onto the scene?   Umm, not actually until I went across to <LOC>France<\LOC>, because in the mean time his… one of his sidekicks was a Captain <PER>Owen<\PER>, who had been the Portuguese… umm, it wasn’t an attaché, the Naval representative in <LOC>Lisbon<\LOC>, umm and so when he joined us on the staff of Admiral <PER>Parry<\PER>, I was attached to him and he always called me his minina. . Do you know, I’ve never actually spoken to a Portuguese to find out, I was told it meant friend, but I was always thinking… He always told people if they wanted something ‘go and ask my minina.’ But he was a very gentle, very nice man, who… about whom I knew… never heard much about him at all. I know Admiral <PER>Parry<\PER>, umm, at the end of the war, umm, I think he… he was an apple grower in <LOC>Kent<\LOC>, and that’s what, in his retirement that’s what he did. But Captain <PER>Owen<\PER> I never knew. What did you sense? What did you know about this escalation towards D-Day? How, sort of, privy to it were you? Oh, absolutely, because, you know, although I wasn’t in the typing pool, as it was, umm, I knew… I’d seen papers going through and you knew what the planning was. And you say it was top secret, what… just describe the secrecy process. What did you have to do in order to be let in? Well it was, umm, BIGOT (British Invasion of German Occupied) was the third level, which was the absolutely… I don’t think we could ever get through, but there were special lines and things on the telephone and it was mostly for use by telephone, but I never really knew how they decided, umm, I knew when I had to… … if I had to make a call which line I had to use, whether it was the ordinary one, the top secret or BIGOT, but I never knew when, say Captain <PER>Owen<\PER> was wanting me to do something and he said ‘that’ll be BIGOT’ how he knew it had to be BIGOT, you know. That was something known to him. Is BIGOT above top secret? Yes. Just describe what your job was. What were you actually doing? Predominantly?    I was in <LOC>London<\LOC>, wasn’t I? Well, mainly doing the Admiral’s or Captain <PER>Owen<\PER>, whichever one was around, doing the, umm, their post and taking dictation and what planning they had to do in terms of post-op. Most of the post operative stuff was the division of the German <ORG>Navy<\ORG> when the war was over, you know, who was going to have what, and that was interesting, because of course the Russians wanted everything… … this was much further on, when we were in <LOC>Berlin<\LOC>. But the Russians always wanted all the big stuff, you know, and we knew all the best equipment was in the smaller destroyers and things, so, umm, we went for those. So, you know, they were working out all those sort of things and of course it all had to go up through the admiralty and back again, so it all took time. But it was just straightforward short-hand reporting of the post operative planning. Even before D-Day? Yeah. Did you ever meet any… you know, were there any other like <PER>Churchill<\PER>, any of the other big wigs? Never saw <PER>Churchill<\PER>. <PER>Montgomery<\PER>, umm, when we were in <LOC>Germany<\LOC>, it was the fashion to have a dog. I never had one, but umm, my friend had one which she called Frat, ‘cause that of course was no fraternisation. And I remember we… we had an office, we were in <LOC>Frankfurt<\LOC> at the time, and the office there had a sort of staircase going up and <PER>Paddy<\PER> always took Frat to work with her. . Nobody minded ‘cause the war was over by then. And, err, we were going upstairs one day and somebody said ‘watch out, <PER>Montgomery<\PER>’s coming’ and he was in the building, at some meeting and he was coming again with his entourage down the stairs as we were going up, you see. And, umm, apparently, he didn’t do it in front of us, but, umm, when he got back to his office he told his adjutant to contact whoever was responsible for the Wrens to say he didn’t want dogs in the building. Typical! So, if you were very privy to all this stuff, when did you know it was going to be June 5th or 6th? Did you know that? Umm, well yes because, you know, of the delay. Do you mean D-Day? Yeah. Because of the delay, with, you know, yeah. So you knew that… that this was going to be the day that the landings were happening? Did you ever…    Yes. Well, it was… you did and you didn’t, you know. There were always things being said to put you off, so that you weren’t a hundred percent sure. But, I don’t suppose anybody was really because of the weather and things, but we were… …when I was at <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> and there wasn’t, you know, we’d done all the work we had to do, that we were waiting, umm, we were sent cherry picking in the <PER>Kent<\PER> orchards, and that was amazing because all the lanes and roads all round, sort of Kent and the sort of area going down to the coast were full of army vehicles and men waiting. You knew that they were there ready to go! But I think that’s how I know rather than through the office. So after <PER>Bushy<\PER> <PER>Park<\PER>, you went back to <LOC>Chatham<\LOC>, did you? Or back over to… <LOC>Bushy<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC>, I’ve got to get this, ‘cause I did so many things! Umm, no from <LOC>Bushy<\LOC> <LOC>Park<\LOC>, umm, we were moved back to <LOC>London<\LOC> and I worked in <LOC>Princes<\LOC> <LOC>Gardens<\LOC> there. And we lived in <LOC>England<\LOC>’s lane, in… in sort of… <LOC>England<\LOC>’s Lane it’s sort of Swiss Cottage way. And there was a nurses’ home there, I think it was the cherry cross nurses’ home and they used that for <ORG>WRN<\ORG> billet. . And then we used to travel to <LOC>Princes<\LOC> <LOC>Gardens<\LOC> from there, and it was from <LOC>Princes<\LOC> <LOC>Gardens<\LOC> that I was drafted over to <LOC>France<\LOC>. Can you remember how you felt when you found out you’d be going, following the expedition? I was a bit disappointed ‘cause I felt that my… I am still, that my Naval life was anything but <ORG>Navy<\ORG>, you know, ‘cause I had great… great ideas of being boats crew, as I said, and going to sea with the mail?. So I was a bit disappointed that it was going to be in land, as it were. But once I’d got used to it, and there was a certain adventure as well in going over. Did you sail to <LOC>France<\LOC>? We went over… you know those, umm… boats they took the troops over in, the… we went over. Actually, umm, when it came to it the war was… the army was almost in <LOC>Berlin<\LOC> by then, so they felt it was safe to put the girls over. And we went across to a little town in <LOC>Normandy<\LOC> called <LOC>Granville<\LOC> on the umm, well ducks we called them, you know DUK, those, like landing craft. And I was terribly sick. . I may say it proved to me I wasn’t a sailor anyway! Describe the sort of… the day that you went on the landing crafts to <LOC>France<\LOC>. Just going back a little bit on the story and what you remember of… you know, that day. Where did you sail from and what was the weather like etc, can you remember?    Yes, the weather wasn’t too good, hence the fact that I was sick. Umm, I suppose… I think there were probably nearly… between fifty and a hundred of us going. Not only WRNS, but others. Umm, trying to think. We went from one of the little ports. They weren’t really ports, they were around the <LOC>Beaulieu<\LOC> river, that way. Umm, we were excited, we didn’t… you know, you had all sorts of imaginations of what might happen crossing the channel – might sink, you know and you’d be able to swim far enough, and you know, we didn’t have to go through water when we got the other side like you see the men, you know trailing out with all their stuff through water. They managed to beach us, so we were quite dry when we got to the other side. . And, you know, the French actually in <LOC>Normandy<\LOC> were very accommodating and they were very pleased to see us. They were very different, in my view, to the ones we met in <LOC>Paris<\LOC>. What… was it obviously war-torn? Oh yes. Yes, you know, the umm… because it would be after D-Day of course that we went across, so things were still pretty, umm, broken, you know and all the, sort of front line houses and things were all bashed about, because they’d been bombarded of course from the sea. And <PER>Granville<\PER>, what was the set up there, and you… you know, you’re still in a war zone, basically, aren’t you? It was a war zone. Well, it was just a sort of getting off point for moving people on behind the army, I think it was felt to be a reasonable place to start moving, ‘cause we had a lot of equipment as well. We didn’t but the army and the air force and the navy for that matter all had equipment to move up with us. . And I think <PER>Granville<\PER> probably as a little town was considered, you know they had, umm, good roads… not good, but the transport situation, moving stuff was reasonable. But very basic living conditions, you know, we had no running water or umm, we had sort of things like your tripod with canvass bags in them which we used as washing… err, machines, well… umm for washing. What else was there? It was like camping really, from the living point of view and very little work we had at that time. And what… were you just writing or did you have teleprinters or anything like that? Was there any technology?    Oh yes, there was a lot of… but not in the group I was with, you know, the… actually the first people to go over were the communicators. The telephone operators and so on, umm, and of course they were still… the engineers were still fitting up field equipment, when they arrived. And there were a lot of WRNS in that group. Tremendous number. And from <PER>Granville<\PER>, you know, they found the work they wanted me to do was more centred back in <LOC>London<\LOC>, so I was shipped back to <LOC>London<\LOC>, to wait until they’d prepared what we needed, or I had to help do that. Umm, and we went then to <LOC>Paris<\LOC>, but I went from <LOC>London<\LOC>, from <LOC>England<\LOC>’s <PER>Lane<\PER> that was, to <LOC>Paris<\LOC> on my own and then I really was… I’d not been anywhere on my own before, and they… I was met when I got to the <ORG>Gare<\ORG> <ORG>du<\ORG> <ORG>Nord<\ORG>, ‘cause I went over on the train, by another <PER>Wren<\PER> who’d been over. And then we were… I was billeted and worked in the chateau in, umm, it’s a suburb of <LOC>Paris<\LOC> anyhow, and I worked there for a very short time, and then the administrative group were following on behind the army, and we went from, umm, <LOC>Paris<\LOC> to <LOC>Frankfurt<\LOC> and, umm, I didn’t enjoy <LOC>Frankfurt<\LOC> very much because, umm, there wasn’t much to do by now, you know, most of the planning had been done and life became rather, sort of, there didn’t seem to be any point in what we were doing, we’d done it all, you know, so it was a bit of a playground. Okay, was this at the end of the… Is this after the war? Yeah. Now this is the, umm, troops had entered <LOC>Berlin<\LOC>, umm, and we were back in <LOC>Paris<\LOC>, so it was sort of just as the war was ending. And yes it had ended, because one of the things that struck me in <LOC>Paris<\LOC> were the fashions, you know, the most beautiful hats made out of cellophane paper, you know, sweet papers and things that the women had made. They seemed untouched by the war in <LOC>Paris<\LOC>. . They didn’t much like us, I don’t think! I think the Germans had given them quite a good time. Were you with Admiral <PER>Parry<\PER> then, at this point? No. I met Admiral <PER>Parry<\PER> when I got to <LOC>Paris<\LOC>. And what was he like? As a person very quiet, you know, you didn’t really feel, you know, he could hit anybody let alone kill anybody, but, umm, or even discipline anybody, he was always very gentle and… and very nice to work for. But very clever, of course. He, umm, knew what he wanted. And what… Just describe the sort of working relationship – what you did for him and what the purpose of you being there was?    Umm, do you mean… Umm, you see most of the… He, he really would have communicated to Captain <PER>Owen<\PER> most of what he wanted, ‘cause he’d be off doing something else. Umm, but… … so that Captain <PER>Owen<\PER> was really the person who was giving me work, when there was work to be done, but Admiral <PER>Parry<\PER> certainly was very approachable and he mixed with us, there was no sort of officers and others. Everybody mixed. And, err, he’s a difficult man to describe really. That’s nicely described, Irene… You know, but the… when we were in <LOC>Berlin<\LOC>, do you know <LOC>Berlin<\LOC> at all, in the lakes in the Wannsee, the lakes that are on the outskirts. Well, when we were living in what had been the, umm, Japanese Embassy in <LOC>Berlin<\LOC>. The most beautiful house and it was in that district where the lakes were – I always said the Wannsee lakes, and they would freeze over in the winter, ‘cause we had a winter there and, you know, the admiral would arrange skating parties and, you know, of course the ice there is so thick because it’s so cool, that you could have barbeques on the ice. . And, you know, that’s when life became a bit superficial, latterly when there wasn’t much work to do, you know, you really felt you should be somewhere doing some work! And how did you get from <LOC>Paris<\LOC> into <LOC>Frankfurt<\LOC>? Were you on railways or were you in vehicles? Oh, in Naval Jeeps. Most of the travelling we did. The only thing, when I went from <LOC>Frankfurt<\LOC> to <LOC>Berlin<\LOC>, I had been home on leave, and when I got back, it was to find that… I don’t know why but they couldn’t notify me and couldn’t get hold of me to let me know that the main party had gone on to <LOC>Berlin<\LOC> and it… … when I got back to <LOC>Frankfurt<\LOC>, I had to go and report to one of the army officers to get transport. And when I got there I found a message to say that General <PER>Eisenhower<\PER>’s chauffeur had married one of our WRNS. I knew they were very friendly before I went. And that he let them have his house in, umm, near <LOC>Frankfurt<\LOC> for their honeymoon and they were both due back in <LOC>Berlin<\LOC> and they would give me a lift. So I went breezing up the autobahn from <LOC>Frankfurt<\LOC> to <LOC>Berlin<\LOC> in General <PER>Eisenhower<\PER>’s car! Amazing! And what was <LOC>Berlin<\LOC> like? What was post-war <LOC>Berlin<\LOC> like? Absolutely devastated. Yeah. That really did shake me when I saw it, you know, there was, almost every building we saw was destroyed and there were these, and they weren’t necessarily old women, but they looked old, ‘cause they were all hunched up, you know, in dark clothes with wheelbarrows clearing the streets. Working so hard and little food, you know, they were working with very little strength. . But, umm, I must give the Germans their due; they did work hard to get <LOC>Berlin<\LOC> back. Did you go to the <LOC>Brandenburg<\LOC> <LOC>Gate<\LOC> or ???    Oh yes. Yes. Tell me about some of that? Well, that again was more like a tourist trip, you know, we… I’ve been trying to think what our office in <LOC>Berlin<\LOC> was like, and do you know… By then, of course, it was control commission, and, umm, I can’t visualise it at all, it’s an absolute blank in my memory. I can remember the Wrenery, the Japanese Embassy, and I can remember going on the tram from there to the office, but I can’t remember the office. At all! And I’m not… I was there for nearly a year. . But, umm, we went to see the bunker, you know, where <PER>Hitler<\PER> was killed, and that was still in, you know, pretty rough state, you know, bits of furniture were still there, you know, it hadn’t been tidied up. What was your sentiment towards the Germans at the time? Well, it was interesting because, umm, I found them very helpful, but then, and, you know, I quite liked them, but of course they had a lot to gain from us, in the way of food and so on. The Russians, of course, were the… the problem. Because, I… The story goes that the main Russian army that took <LOC>Berlin<\LOC>, they pulled them back and they replaced them with the sort of third line who were Mongolians, and they were pretty rough, and, umm, on one occasion coming home from the office, a couple, very… they used to drink an awful lot, any booze they could get hold of, a couple of very drunk Russians started… We were walking home from the office in <LOC>Berlin<\LOC> to our digs, and, umm, they started getting their guns out and shooting all over the place, and we had to jump in a hedge and after that… to keep out of their way, and after that they put a fairly strong Marine presence on the road, you know, a sort of guard on the… and we weren’t allowed to travel on our own. So, we were pretty okay on transport, if we got the tram home, we were alright, it’s if you started walking. We had a German cook in the Wrenery, and he found it difficult to be pleasant to us, but he was, because of course he… he used to collect our used tea bags and take them home and he knew that if he didn’t, you know, treat us all properly, he’d get taken off and we’d get someone else and he’d lose out on his bits and pieces he was getting. And we also had an interesting maid, <PER>Franzeska<\PER>, who was German. Not, sorry Jewish. And, umm, she had had a very bad time. She had legitimately become, well I say legitimately, but it was her boyfriend and not a German or a Russian, err, pregnant and she had this baby in a cellar which she was hiding from because the Germans were still looking for Jews, even after the war, and, err, anyhow, it was a Russian soldier who actually helped her have her baby in this cellar and, you know, who really rescued her. And then of course the British… … We were in the British region, of course, but <PER>Franzeska<\PER> used to have lessons in German for us, which… She was an educated Jew. What is said So you didn’t go to <LOC>Potsdam<\LOC>? Yes, umm, the <LOC>Potsdam<\LOC> conference was held while I was in <LOC>Berlin<\LOC> and Admiral <PER>Parry<\PER>, of course, had a… ‘cause the main purpose of <LOC>Potsdam<\LOC> was to sort of finalise the break up of the German <ORG>Navy<\ORG>, umm, and I went with Captain <PER>Owen<\PER>, because of course they’d done their work on the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> to contribute to that. I didn’t go in to the actual meeting hall, ‘cause it’s quite small actually, I was surprised. . I’ve been back since and had another look at it, you know, and I thought yes it is small. But I went this time, you know, because I was driving as well, you know, so our group, umm, the Captain said if you’d like to go, you can go, but you won’t be able to go into the conference. Did you know it was a significant moment in history? Oh yes. I think you… you knew that, yes. . You know, you saw <PER>Stalin<\PER> and <PER>Churchill<\PER>, you know, just as though you were a tourist watching! You talked a bit earlier about how the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> knew more about the <ORG>German<\ORG> <ORG>Navy<\ORG> than the Russians. The Russians wanted the carriers, the Brits wanted the destroyers. Was there… You know, just sort of recap on that. Was there any more of that discussion, sort of pre-Potsdam that you can recall or was it all sort of done and dusted by then? No, I don’t… I think they sort of… …There was another, umm, Admiral <PER>Miles<\PER> was someone who appeared on the scene at, umm, before <LOC>Potsdam<\LOC>, and he had a lot to do with the, you know, sorting out the German <ORG>Navy<\ORG>. But, umm… Sorry I’ve forgotten what your question was now. Just was there more discussion about, oh you know now we’ve heard about the V2 rockets, we should be getting those rather than the Russians? No, I think it was all done before hand. I don’t remember. I know there was, and I can’t remember what the… there was supposed to have been an incident when, now of course, I don’t mean <PER>Churchill<\PER> I mean <PER>Atlee<\PER> because it was at the <LOC>Potsdam<\LOC> conference, you know, that <PER>Churchill<\PER>, umm, lost his seat and <PER>Atlee<\PER> came in and that meant… made a change of foreign secretary and it was… What was his name now, the big man? Socialist. He was Atlee’s foreign secretary, and he is reported to have got, umm, cross over something at <LOC>Potsdam<\LOC> and banged the table and water… You know, there were glasses of water which, I gather that the Russians didn’t take very kindly to! This man, you know, who was determined to have his way bang the table. The work up until we got to <LOC>Berlin<\LOC> was really quite interesting. . But once, you know, the final stamps were being put on, the dividing of the city into regions and things like the break-up of the <ORG>Navy<\ORG>, of the <ORG>German<\ORG> <ORG>Navy<\ORG>, there really wasn’t much interesting to do, and it did become a sort of, almost a playground. Just tell me about VJ day? Well, we were in <LOC>Berlin<\LOC> when VJ day was announced and they said there would be a parade towards the <LOC>Brandenburg<\LOC> gate, so we went, had the day off and went down to see and it was a wonderful display, even though it was the end of the war and everybody was a bit tired and fed up. The Americans put on a great show with what equipment they had and so did the Russians. Were you thrilled that it was the end of the war? Were we… Were you thrilled that the war was over then? Yes, I suppose we were really. We were all a bit uncertain about what was going to happen, you know, the war was over and, you know, there was this devastated city – how was it going to recover and, you know, who was going to see the Germans behave themselves, you know, with little recognition that the Russians were really the problem, in terms of the future, because that was in Stalin’s day, of course. . Yes, it was like going, any group just going out to see a parade, you know. When was you demob, and just tell me a bit about that. Oh, I did go back to <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> to be demobbed. You know, I said I wanted to be demobbed and of course they were then planning the break-up of all the services, and I went back to <LOC>Chatham<\LOC>, just to be… hand over things that I… equipment I’d got that I had to return. It was a very uneventful thing, my demob! And I returned home. What were the circumstances around your BEM? Well, that again, was a bit difficult for me to explain because it was mainly for the work that I did, you know. The thing that came, you know, from… from the palace just said for zeal and devotion to duty. Whatever that means! Yeah. . But of course it was war-time and there was no sort of going to the palace to get your gong or anything, you know, it just came in the post! It must be nice to have… But it was quite nice to feel that it was recognised. Although it wasn’t madly interesting or madly responsible, you felt you were contributing in some way, which is what I wanted to do in the beginning! You know, it’s a great thing to serve your King and country. What is said Doing your bit! Yes. And how do you reflect on your life as a wren, then? I think one of the things, you know, I began to become much more interested in being with people rather than paper, as it were, and I had a… I was looking round for a job and I just found that there was an approved school wanting a secretary and they called them housemistress, in Bath. I didn’t want to be in <LOC>Bristol<\LOC>, I didn’t want to go back to my old job, and that’s how… that was my first step into social work. And then my father became very ill and as the unmarried daughter in the family, I was expected to be at home. And, you know, I was concerned for both of them, because he was a good deal older than mum, so I returned. I gave up the approved school that I was working at, which incidentally the last one was a place called <LOC>Duncroft<\LOC> in <LOC>Middlesex<\LOC>, which had been associated with <PER>Jimmy<\PER> <PER>Saville<\PER>! I thought my goodness! And, then I… … Oh, I had, before I left <PER>Duncroft<\PER> I had got myself a job with <LOC>Bristol<\LOC> children’s department, which was in the days before the social services as such were formed. And I stayed with them ‘til I retired. Which, golly, do you know that was twenty nine years ago. Do you still think about the <ORG>WRNS<\ORG>? Oh yes! It… Oh the WRNS has remained constant because they have a very strong association and that’s, I gather, how you ran me to <LOC>Earth<\LOC>. And I’ve belonged to the local branch since 1953, I think it was, I joined. So, you’re still as proud to be a WRN now, as you were when you became one? Yeah. Yeah. End of
 I served from 1941 to 1945 basically Western Approaches that includes <LOC>Plymouth<\LOC> right the way up to the top of <LOC>Scotland<\LOC>. And what’s your name? <PER>Joan<\PER> <PER>Field<\PER>, I was <PER>Joan<\PER> <PER>Rose<\PER>. Where are you from and what are the circumstances to you joining the WRNS? I was actually born in <LOC>Cambridgeshire<\LOC> at a little village called <LOC>Meldreth<\LOC> in I think it was fiftieth century thatched cottage which was my grandmothers small holding, I was born there and my parents worked on the small holding in 1934 we moved to a new town of <LOC>Welwyn<\LOC> <LOC>Garden<\LOC> <LOC>City<\LOC> where my father then got employment and I lived there and went to school there and won a scholarship and a bursary to ???? high school which is in <LOC>Welwyn<\LOC> <LOC>Garden<\LOC> <LOC>City<\LOC> and I’m matriculated at which was then a school of Matriculation I was then seventeen and I wanted to join. The war had broken out by then obviously, I wanted to join the WRNS, I went down I thought I’ll hopefully get in the WRNS if not I’ll have to go into the <ORG>WAAF<\ORG> but, they accepted me into the WRNS. At the time they were only taking on cooks and stewards which of course I did not want to do. I did an eye test and they decided I had perfect eye sight then and I was told I was going to be a Signaller… … it didn’t mean much to me but, I didn’t mind what it was and I was called up just a month before Christmas to HMS Cabbala which is up in <LOC>Warrington<\LOC>. What year was that?    I’m just trying to think… 1941, in the middle of 1941 and I thought this is marvelous all the officers at Christmas were waiting this is a lovely idea but, of course that was short lived. It was very tough at <LOC>Cabbala<\LOC> you were given two weeks what they call probabtion and you were given all the dirty jobs to do in overalls scrubbing the floors, cleaning the loos it was make or break time really. Squad drill and squad drill… you hated squad drill but, I got to love it after that but, that’s another story. At the end of the fortnight we were accepted some of them went home and some of them went AWOL. If you went AWOL then you just went into munitions or what have you but, if you didn’t really like it then perhaps the <ORG>WAAF<\ORG> would have had you, we were first choice in those days. Everyone wanted to go in the WRNS. And so I started my visual signaling and coding, I did some coding as well but, basically visual signaling and the course lasted I think six months… yes it was about six months, no four months I think and after that time you went on leave and then you were drafted to different places. We all of course put down for <ORG>Plymouth<\ORG> all wanted to come south because I lived then in <LOC>Welwyn<\LOC> <LOC>Garden<\LOC> <LOC>City<\LOC> obviously so it was south I wanted. . I ended up in <LOC>Oban<\LOC> I never even heard of it I had to find it on the map when I got the draft, I didn’t even know where it was… I found it and I thought ‘this is lovely, it will be lovely up there’. Can I just go back a bit you sounded like you were emphatic about wanting to join the <ORG>WRNS<\ORG> over any other service why? I don’t know I got no naval… all my father and grandfather all served in the army I don’t know what it was I loved the sea maybe the uniform… do you know I don’t really know but, I always wanted to be in the WRNS it was just something… I think <PER>Stephanie<\PER> had the same when you read her book. There is an attraction to it I suppose in a way it’s a sort of glamour of the WRNS. Now you mentioned <PER>Cabbala<\PER> and you mentioned ship visualization and coding but, I’d like to know a bit more about what you were learning and how you learnt visualization and what was the process? Well first of all you got to learn the Morse Code even at seventeen that was a bit tricky but, still you learn the Morse Code and that is absolutely drummed into you the Morse Code. Is it purely repetition?    Yes really and truly and you learn gimmicks to learn it you know f for face you learn all these gimmicky things to remind you. It is tough we were all put into classes and the visual signallers classes all began with a V and my class was verity and I can’t remember what <PER>Stephanie<\PER>’s class is but, she does mention it in the book. The wireless telegraphers classes all began with a W like <PER>Warspite<\PER> and the coding classes all began with a C and each course was a different length and we learnt Morse Code, Semaphore to signal with flags you know like the old <PER>Nelson<\PER> signal which kept changing learning the phonetic alphabet which half way through our course changed so the Americans could understand it which annoyed us because why should we have to change after all these years. Anyway so the phonetic alphabet… … every class was manned by an ex serving man usually a chief who’d never dealt with women before and some of them were a bit tough, a bit tough but, we needed it because we were completely raw to it all and we were taught naval discipline and different time watches you know how to read a twenty four hour clock which of course we hadn’t started to use then, the basics… really basics and I found it quite enjoyable it was just like being at school really. And what about your Wrenery where were you staying what was that like? Pretty spartan but, not too bad it was old <ORG>Nissan<\ORG> huts I think they’d been used by I think she definitely mentions it in her book I think they had been used by the post office they were old <ORG>Nissan<\ORG> huts on this big site at <LOC>Newton<\LOC> ???? just outside <ORG>Warrington<\ORG> and it’s obviously now been developed into a big housing estate but, it was a very large camp mostly the Wrenery but, there was also men onboard as well they were learning I think WT but, we were obviously being trained to take over some of the signal stations from the men to release them which we learnt afterwards obviously so I got my draft up to <LOC>Oban<\LOC>. And when you get a draft how is your communication with your parents and this draft you say ‘Oban blimey where’s that’ how did you get there? What did your parents think?    Well a bit staggered with my mother and my father my father took me up to <LOC>Euston<\LOC> <LOC>Station<\LOC>. I got this draft just a thing report to I suppose it was patrol police up at <LOC>Euston<\LOC> then I was sent to… no I went to <ORG>Kings<\ORG> <ORG>Cross<\ORG> and had to go to Euston all this military stuff all in civvies you were only allowed to take a suitcase of cloths. One outfit of civvie clothes and then the usual pajamas always pajamas you know the usual sort of things you were going into hospital I suppose but, only one set of civilian clothes and to report to this place at one of the stations I think it was Kings Cross and they took me under their wing and sorted me out and got me onto the train my father saw me off and that was really all that happened I ended up where ever am I going… you go miles and miles and of course there was quite a few sailors going up going back of leave and they were all kind to me, they all realised what was happening and the train was crowded and I can remember we couldn’t sit down anywhere and one of the sailors put me up on top of the rack at the top so I could have a sleep. I can always remember that. We got to <PER>Carlisle<\PER> there was an air raid warning and we had to stay in <LOC>Carlisle<\LOC> siding for about an hour which meant that I had missed my train from <LOC>Carlisle<\LOC> to <LOC>Sterling<\LOC> where I had to change again so that was another problem. Got to Sterling and of course the train to <LOC>Oban<\LOC> had gone so I was stranded the <ORG>WVS<\ORG> put me up in a hotel or hostel for the night and I went on to <LOC>Oban<\LOC> reported to <LOC>Oban<\LOC> to the officer in charge at <LOC>Oban<\LOC> and was told I was going to the pier signal station in the morning I was going to the pier signal station and in the meantime of course I’d been kitted it out at <LOC>Cabbala<\LOC> we were kitted up but, I didn’t have any bell bottoms that was essential for a VS Wren because it was so cold. So I was issued with bell bottoms and the next day went on duty and I thought this is crazy all this sort of business at <LOC>Cabbala<\LOC> and all the strict discipline naval discipline nobody seemed to be bothered up in <LOC>Oban<\LOC>. I don’t even think they realised there was a war on except for the convoys coming in. . I liked it, I liked <LOC>Scotland<\LOC> <PER>Stephanie<\PER> didn’t like it if you’re reading her book or you’ve ever read it she just didn’t seem to mix in very well with Scottish people but, I’ve got a Scottish grandfather so I did accept it more and I realise that they’re a bit insula they didn’t mean to be off putting but, they were it’s an insular land up in the <LOC>Highlands<\LOC>. I don’t know whether you know the Highlands very well, they’re a thing unto themselves. Ok well so just describe a bit about Oban… what the base was like, what your surrounding were like, where you slept and then we’ll talk about the work?    Well <LOC>Oban<\LOC> first of all I was stationed in what was called the Station Hotel and the signals station on the pier was only a short walk away and I met up with a girl that was going to work with me she had been there about a week we hadn’t yet started getting the convoys in so we were told what was going to happen but, the convoys would come in and they’d be in a bay and we had to man it all the time, we weren’t allowed to go on any boats but, that’s another story we had to monitor everything coming in and out we also had to look after funny enough the <ORG>RAF<\ORG> had their Sunderlands and <LOC>Catalina<\LOC>’s up there and they had a call sign which changed every hour and half of them could never ever read it so we used to have to read their code signal for them to send their patrol boat out but, that was unbeknown to our base that never had a clue what was going on, it was a crazy set up really and the submarines on patrol duty used to come in alongside the pier we had to give them their signals when they went out on patrol but, that was mostly what we were doing at the pier signal station. But, this wasn’t adequate enough and <LOC>Ganavan<\LOC> signal station which was right around the corner from where we were was still manned by the men. And they also had the new ASDICS centre opening up just below which was radar on ASDIC that was still done by the men and the men was going from <LOC>Ganavan<\LOC> and they were going over to <PER>Lismore<\PER> and the WRNS weren’t allowed out there because they were completely alone out there. There was no habitation just a few sheep farmers so the WRNS weren’t allowed out in <LOC>Lismore<\LOC> and that’s where the photograph was taken unbeknown to anybody. So the Ganavan signal station was going to <LOC>Oban<\LOC> and we was going to go there which meant great difficulty because from the Station Hotel to <PER>Ganavan<\PER> was about two or three miles in the middle of the night that’s no joke. So eventually I was there for about… at pier signal station from about I would say about a month before <PER>Ganavan<\PER> was opened. <PER>Ganavan<\PER> signal station was then opened up for the WRNS and we took over from the men and we had an intake of more VS WRNS so there was now six of us instead of four and we took over Ganavan from the men, very very spartan when we was at the pier station we were able to have meals in the mess, proper meals and when we were on night watch they would do us up sandwiches and when we moved from pier signal station to the <LOC>Ganavan<\LOC> signal station we were stationed at a place called ????? lodge which was very tough going. They didn’t like watch keepers because they couldn’t handle us nearly all the wrenery was writers or WT Operators who worked proper watch hours they were nine until five. . Not us we had to do watch keeping hours same as the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> so if we were lucky you would get a hot dinner, if you didn’t you just got a sardine sandwich so the food was pretty sparse if you read in the book people my friends who read the book say ‘why did you stand it’ but, I said ‘there was a war on we didn’t know any different we had to do it, it was our job’ the men… it was a very very sparse signal station do you want me to describe it to you?... What is said Yes please yeah… The signal station itself was right on top of <LOC>Ganavan<\LOC> just by <PER>Dunollie<\PER> house which is the house of the lord and lady <PER>MacDougall<\PER> I think they were called yes <PER>MacDougall<\PER> and it was on their land and it had been built as a look out coast I think originally for the coast guards it was very sparse. It was a two tier place you had to reach it… but to get to it it was a climb up a cliff almost a sheer cliff a road went below us and this sheer cliff up which we had to carry the oldest lamp batteries which was very heavy and then we had to have a coal fire… A because we had to be able to burn any confidential books that we had if any… if we had any kind of invasion we had to put the books goodness knows how because they were lead line… but, that’s why we had the fire. . We had a bunk down below and a signal up top and a balcony all around, we had a big ten inch Aldis lamps an RT set and it was really just go we were pushed into the deep end. And how far could you see from there what was your vista? Oh we could see where she’d got it right from… we could see right the way down to Mull over to <PER>Lismore<\PER> we had perfect vision of everything that was coming and going. Why was that such an important stretch of coast line in terms of the convoys and your role there? Because it was very safe they thought. They could come in and if you had a look at a map it is a complete bay and <LOC>Tobermory<\LOC> the escort ships and usually about two or three destroyers dropped the convoy off and went up to <LOC>Tobermory<\LOC> then they would go up the Sound of Mull. . If you could visualize that coastline Mull almost protects the bay so any ships passing have to go around behind Mull they don’t realise come in… that’s another story about the <PER>Duke<\PER> <PER>of<\PER> <PER>York<\PER>. I think it was a very safe haven they came in, they were escorted off from us probably down to <LOC>Gourock<\LOC> into the Clyde for unloading or they would mass up ready to go out and the <ORG>ETA<\ORG> of arrival or an expected time of dispatch… they were either coming or going. And what was the most ships you think you ever saw there? I don’t know the whole harbour would be full I would say thirty more than that yes… thirty most likely and of course you’d have a list and unfortunately you think there might be a straggler but, they never came and that was a terrible thing and you wonder what happened to that one. We had quite a lot of losses unfortunately not in the bay you know coming and going. You’d expect to see a load of ships…   Yes because we’d have a list sent to us which was a confidential list and an expected time of arrival and you’d give them about two or three hours but, they never came and you just wonder what happened and they were all manned by mostly merchant men so their <PER>Morse<\PER> wasn’t very good but, now and again you’d get a ship that had a few United States… when <LOC>America<\LOC> came in it was better planned you know the liberty ships came and they were better manned and a little bit overpowering really because they were so…. Shall I say this over clever. They used to send <PER>Morse<\PER> at the rate of knots thinking that we couldn’t answer it and we would send back at the same rate. This is why we didn’t like the Americans very much I’m afraid they tried all sorts of things. . They tried to come up to our signal station and we couldn’t have them in, we weren’t allowed to have them in. We had one or two problems with people coming up… shall I go on? Yeah… One night I could hear footsteps coming up and a knock on the door and I thought this voice I didn’t know who it was it was a man’s voice and we’d already had a <PER>Wren<\PER> murder in <LOC>Inveraray<\LOC> a VS <PER>Wren<\PER> murdered in <LOC>Inveraray<\LOC> on night watch so we were all… we were all taught how to handle a pistol we had to go on the range which was the <ORG>RAF<\ORG> had a range and we were taken onto the range by an instructor and we were taught to fire a pistol and I have very small wrists and I was taught to fire holding my wrist so I could fire with my wrist… we also had a rifle up in the signal station it wasn’t loaded there was no ammunition in it but, the pistols were but, this rifle wasn’t loaded it was just there as a warning. I heard these footsteps and this is perfectly true… I heard these footsteps coming up and I said to my oppo ‘I don’t like this very much’ so this… kept knocking on the door and in the end I got this rifle and I thought I can’t… I knew it wasn’t loaded and I thought what am I going to do so I put it up the other way and as this voice came through the thing I lifted it up and was going to clock him on the head with it and he said ‘it’s alright <PER>Joan<\PER> it’s only me’ and it was one of the signalman from down below stupid… who’d got a date, I had changed watches with a girl… I shouldn’t tell this really. He obviously used to come up for a cup of tea at this time and have a cup of tea with her and he thought she was on watch and in the end he could of got himself killed and I would have been quite within my rights because nobody… … we’ve got a great big prohibited notice on the door and it never ever came to anything and I never ever reported it because it would of got him into terrible trouble but, we were armed but, only with a pistol and a rifle with no ammunition because we had a Wren in <LOC>Inveraray<\LOC>. What were the circumstances of that?    I don’t know I’m afraid all that is a need to know you were never ever told what happened we were just told to be very aware and to take extra precautions and I think <PER>Stephanie<\PER> mentions this in her book as well. We never ever knew what had happened and I mean we had what we thought was a spy that come down and it was all prohibited land for civilians but, this man used to come down and sit on the rocks and wait for the convoys and he had binoculars and a camera and we were not allowed to take photographs of the convoys, we could take photographs around our cabin… around the thing but, not the convoys... . not allowed to so we reported this man to our headquarters in signals back in Station Hotel and nothing ever happened about it, he just disappeared we never heard whether he was just a local newspaper man or whether he was a kind of spy or whether he was just interested in ships we never heard. I’m afraid in those days it was all need to know you were never ever told. And just picking up on the Americans you were talking about because the Americans gave you some hassle? Yes well they would try to bribe us, they wanted to come up the signal station ‘look honey we’ve got some nylons’ or honey we’ve got bananas onboard you know this sort of thing… it was so stupid and childish we took a dislike to them what we didn’t like was the way they used to treat their officers complete disrespect they would call them by their first names which we thought was terrible and the captains and all the officers never seemed to take any notice of them and in <LOC>Oban<\LOC> one day shopping and the Americans who came onboard… came shopping as well and they would like to take us for a cup of coffee and ok fine which they did we took them to the <ORG>YMCA<\ORG> and had a cup of coffee going back some of their officers were coming the other way well we were appalled the way they spoke… … no saluting ‘hiya hiya cap’ I thought this is terrible I can’t describe it they were just another world away and they were trying to bribe us with bananas and nylons and we just didn’t want to know we thought it was so childish with all this very fast flashing <PER>Morse<\PER>. You touched on the different methods of communication you had the semaphore, you talked about the lamps there. So just when do you used different types of communication or is it one specific type in <LOC>Oban<\LOC> in the station? Always by <PER>Morse<\PER> by light or sometime by RT but, nearly always… … the RT we only really used for the ASDIC station but, lamps <PER>Aldis<\PER> and all the big ten inch which was very difficult of course to handle you had to go out on the balcony and of course up there the winds were always at gale force and we always had to hoist the cones for the weather every day… every day we had to hoist the cones for the convoys to know what the weather was. What is said What were the cones? The cones were the cone was a shape like that and you hoisted it up for the north wind and down for the south wind very primitive but, it gave them some idea where the wind. Another thing you could tell which way the wind was blowing just look at the ensign which we always had to fly, the white ensign and we had to by the colours… put it up at sunrise and down at sunset so the ensign was always flying so you could always tell which way the wind was blowing without the cone and if it was a gale force wind we used to put the cone up which sometimes meant the cone was up for days because the gales would blow up there, very windy. And sometimes we would have to be lashed onto the ten inch by our oppo because it was so windy you kept being blown away it was very very cold and we were always wet but, it didn’t seem to matter. Did you have a bath or a shower up there? When we went back…. How long would you be situated up there then? Well the night watch was a long one we’d go on something like eight o’clock and come off at eight o’clock next morning that was a very long one. The other watches was pretty well four hours on four hours off but, in the night watch was a tough one. You said you had to walk there and back? First of all we had to walk we couldn’t… we objected because the men in the ASDIC station down below us got transport they were working the same watches well yes ok… then they decided they would issue us with bicycles which they did. . We had a Wren officer come up to see us and she said this isn’t good enough and then they supplied transport for us so we didn’t have to walk the night watch backwards and forwards three or four miles in the pitch dark along a coast road but, first of all we had to before they realised what was happening. There is a story about The Duke of <LOC>York<\LOC> can you tell me about that?    The <ORG>Duke<\ORG> <ORG>of<\ORG> <ORG>York<\ORG> we never had the big ships the escort ships never really came into us just destroyers or corvettes because they always used to go into Mull to wait for the convoys to go back out so we never had anything what I would call large. I was on watch with <PER>Stephanie<\PER> on this particular occasion and if you can picture the islands and the sea and suddenly you see a great big cross mast coming at you and you thing what an earth is that. You had no idea what it could possibly be and we had no <ORG>ETA<\ORG> for anything, we had nothing. It was moving very slowly it got bigger and bigger we couldn’t believe it of course we called it up and there was no reply and of course that was worrying because there was no reply because every hour it changed the call up sign had changed in the code book so you would call them up by the code what it was for the day and no reply. So we had a little ship… we had two ships actually one was called the <ORG>Southern<\ORG> <ORG>Star<\ORG> and one was called the Southern Wave and they were patrols ships and they used to patrol backwards and forwards along the convoys all the time, they were old something I would call something like a corvette. I think they were old trawlers they were manned by <ORG>Navy<\ORG> and they were… if any trouble we called them up immediately. And we called up the <ORG>Southern<\ORG> <ORG>Star<\ORG> she was way out over <PER>Mull<\PER> and we asked her what it was all about and she said ‘I can’t see anything from here’ because they would be way way… she said ‘I’ll go and investigate’ she said ‘if it’s any trouble I’ll put a shot across it’s bows’ and that was that anyway this thing got bigger and bigger eventually I managed to call up obviously the Bunting Tosser that was visual signallers are called Bunting Tossers. Was asleep I should think he thought we’re only coasting around these islands and he came back quickly D of Y instead of a pennant number because all ships have pennant numbers. Either the pennant number of the ship of the code but, she came back quickly with D of Y and I said to <PER>Stephanie<\PER> ‘D of Y Duck of York’ I said ‘gosh it’s a battleship and base don’t know’ so we quickly phoned our base and they didn’t believe us because nobody had got an <ORG>ETA<\ORG> anyway the captain of our base came rushing down. Took him about half an hour to get to us by which time she was in full view massive great thing it just filled up the whole of the bay I’ve never seen anything like it and of course it was a great big who har about this why didn’t we know. Well of course she was on pilgrimage up to <LOC>Norway<\LOC> after the <PER>Scharnhorst<\PER> and she was doing this I suppose she though they’d got time… I don’t know why they did it they were way of course…. . She must have known the way very well because it’s very dangerous out there but, she did she came right passed us just of Mull. I mean I can show you exactly where she was on a map she just appeared by the islands as if it was on some kind of film it was incredible and the sort of thing you dream about. Lovely story… Nobody ever really again need to know… we never really found out but, we realised afterwards what it was all about she was on her way up to the battle in <LOC>Norway<\LOC>. What is said D-Day? D-Day came we had all ships… we couldn’t understand why they looked so dreadful they were all sort of battered ships and we thought we’d seen some awful sites but, there was about fifty of them with two destroyers The <LOC>Durban<\LOC> and something else one was the <LOC>Durban<\LOC> and one was something else maybe she mentioned it in the book. Anyway and we thought gosh the destroyer looks in terrible state surely the Navy… we had no idea what they were they came in I suppose they came in a week about ten days enough time for <PER>Stephanie<\PER> to get to know this signalmen yes it must be ten days. We still couldn’t understand why they were in such a state and why they didn’t because they only ever stayed two or three days but, they seemed to be a long time and we thought hello something is going on then all our… we were told we were not allowed to post anymore letters all our letters were to be cancelled… all our postage out was to be cancelled everything going out from the base was to be stopped and all leave was stopped and we thought something was in the air. You know you get that feeling. We thought well where they are going what are they going to do and of course they were the block ships. The night before D-Day they didn’t know what they were doing they had no idea what it was all about or so they said. The night before they all seemed to be getting ready… a big ship came alongside some of them and took of a lot of stuff we thought they don’t usually unload here it goes to <LOC>Gourock<\LOC> and <PER>Greenock<\PER> but, they were unloading all sorts of stuff and we watched them through the telescope you know chairs and tables and all sorts of things were coming out and we couldn’t understand this. Next day when we came up on watch they were all busy ready to go out and we had no expected time of departure at all. They all just seemed to disappear and our two patrol ships had no idea. They said ‘what do we do they’re going’ we couldn’t tell them because it was so secret and that was D-Day that was the block ships going down they were all rotten old ships that nobody wanted… … the two destroyers had been so battle-scarred that they were almost sinkable so they were the two big block ships and these were sent down to help out and we never ever heard until the end of the war what it was all about these were obviously then the block ships. A thing you touched on earlier but, I’d like more clarification on is that the convoys essentially you did talk about this documentation so can you just explain again for me you know how the process…?    A dispatch rider would arrive from base from Station Hotel which was their base a dispatch rider would arrive with a confidential letter which would contain <ORG>ETA<\ORG> of the next convoy coming in. so right you’d then get it out put it in front of you and put it up and wait for the first one to come in <ORG>ETA<\ORG> 09:00 and perhaps they wouldn’t start to come in until 09:30 they’d obviously been marked I think from <LOC>Ireland<\LOC> they were then sort of marked across get the <ORG>ETA<\ORG> of them coming across and that was literally how we got the ETA from the dispatch rider confidential letter would come. I suppose they’re every… the convoys were coming in quite regularly at least once a month coming in by the time they’d gone out again. The bay was nearly always choka block and then of course you’ve also got the <ORG>RAF<\ORG> boats going backwards and forwards with their Sunderland’s and <LOC>Catalina<\LOC>’s so it was quite a busy little harbour and every single thing had to be logged and logged out, identified and put down you know you had to be on watch pretty well aware what was going on all around you literally in the air with the <LOC>Catalina<\LOC>’s. . this why we had to have <ORG>Southern<\ORG> <ORG>Wave<\ORG> <ORG>and<\ORG> <ORG>Southern<\ORG> <ORG>Star<\ORG> who used to be out, they were also signaling and trying to get… it was really like a great big heard of sheep and two Shepard’s trying to keep them in it could have been organised chaos but, it wasn’t it was very very good. It always worked it was just sheparding these ships you know these big liberty ships, they were quite big. And do these liberty ships have its own call sign which you would…? Yes each… we knew each one we had a identification for each one so we could mark them off if not we’ve got everyone’s name the list wasn’t very long but, yes we had identification for all of them. You had to concentrate quite hard when they were coming in you couldn’t let your attention wander because you know you’ve got to be so quick. And you talked about some of them not coming how do you feel when you’ve done five convoys and you’re missing twenty boats what was the feeling? Well first of all when it first happened its’ you wonder what happened to those I hope they’re alright but, by the time you’ve done it for about a year or so you just except it you know what do you do you don’t know what has happened to them you never know what’s happened again you’ve got this need to know. . We used to try and find out but, we were never ever told that three of them probably been sunk off somewhere you think I wonder how far they got and what happened to the men but, you know what happened to all that lovely stuff that was coming in or going out I don’t know. You just don’t know you never knew you just had to accept whatever was happening just and leave it put all your sort of personnel feelings aside because it was no good worrying about it because what could you do. And what do you remember of VE-Day?   VE-Day I was still on watch on VE-Day I don’t remember much about it because I was up in <LOC>Scotland<\LOC> we were invited to a big parade in <LOC>Edinburgh<\LOC> which we did take part in later on but, the big VE parade we thought by the time we get there… I mean it’s a journey from <LOC>Oban<\LOC> to <LOC>Edinburgh<\LOC> I mean it’s you just don’t get on your bike and go you’ve got… I don’t remember we just had a party that was all we had a party. . We were never allowed obviously the rum, the rum ration but, sometimes we used to go on… the ships used to come in and we had a tot of rum but, I hated it I didn’t like it very much. Of course after the war I was in the <ORG>Royal<\ORG> <ORG>Naval<\ORG> <ORG>Association<\ORG> and I was Vice Chairman of the ??? branch of the <ORG>Royal<\ORG> <ORG>Naval<\ORG> <ORG>Association<\ORG> and they used to have tots up there always offered me, I don’t like it it’s to hot and to fiery for me so VE-Day was really just a tot of rum and a knees up in the base. And VJ-Day the end of the war totally? The end of the war where was i… at the end of the war I was out <LOC>Toward<\LOC> <LOC>Point<\LOC> in <LOC>Dunoon<\LOC> because as the convoys were no longer needed we were no longer needed so <PER>Stephanie<\PER> went to <LOC>Ireland<\LOC> and I went to Toward Point, <PER>Dunoon<\PER> to HMS Brontosaurus and that was the ships coming back and forth down the <PER>Clyde<\PER> and that was where I spent VJ-Day and just another knees up really you can’t say much more about it and from there I could either stay in the WRNS or I could be demobbed from there which I was demobbed because I wanted to go on a social services course so I already lined up what I wanted to do. In a way now I regret now not staying in I think in a way but, it happened it didn’t work out like that. And how do you reflect on it all now many years later? I enjoyed it I quite liked it, I’m glad I did it, it was an experience I’ll never have again and nobody will ever have again because it will never happen like that again, I enjoyed my time up there, I loved the highlands. End of
 <PER>Joe<\PER> where are you from? Well, I originate from <LOC>Suffolk<\LOC>, I was born in <LOC>Suffolk<\LOC>, my dad was born in <LOC>Suffolk<\LOC>, he was one of three sons and they all joined the navy because work wise in <LOC>East<\LOC> <LOC>Anglia<\LOC> was not too good. When he married my mother wherever he was he tried to get us as children with him. I mean I went to school out in <LOC>Malta<\LOC> for two year. So, what do you remember about the outbreak of war? Well, at that period I mean, (Dad finally decided), well as I was saying I was in the church choir I was walking through the village one day it was always surnames with the vicar “Pitcher” he said, “There’s a job going down at <LOC>Halesworth<\LOC> as an apprentice hairdresser if you wish” It was a job so I went down and got the job, my job obviously at the start I was taught how to shave with the old cutthroat and believe it or not I mean a shave in those days was tuppence and a haircut was four pence. Well, I mean I finally got to shaving the head bloke, the head bloke there I was more nervous than he was, yer anyway I succeeded. Okay, so let’s move on to the war then, what do you remember the outbreak of war where were you and did you expect to get into the navy at that point? People were saying, I mean I was obviously that type of age should be called up and they’d make you a cup of tea, and well my sons in the army or in the navy and I was glad when I finally got my calling up papers. So you didn’t volunteer you were called up? No, no I was called up and the railway warrant was for Afon-wen I thought surely not <LOC>China<\LOC>. So, I looked it up and it was <LOC>Pwllheli<\LOC>, <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Wales<\LOC>. <ORG>HMS<\ORG> <ORG>Glendower<\ORG>, and so finally had come the day and I had to turn up at <LOC>HMS<\LOC> <LOC>Glendower<\LOC>. What was it like going to <LOC>Glendower<\LOC> then?    Well, there was a train journey, train journey and cause funnily enough I met in with other lads who were being called up the same day so you got chatting to them. . I mean every week they’d be a crowd of lads come in and you’d see um come in your now you got your uniform your in the navy and you’d see the train come in and other lads come in and all of them you done your seamanship, and then you were allowed a week at home, sorry not a week a weekend at home and then back and do gunnery and get drafted to a port. Which was your port? My first port was, I’ll think of the name of it in a minute, <PER>Hull<\PER> and again you’d go on a pool, report to a certain place. I was amazed stepping out of the station at <LOC>Hull<\LOC>, the bombing, they were quiet heavily bombed. So you get on this pool and finally I had the ship, a little coaster, a collier “The HMS Kenrix”. HMS Kenrix, I’ve got a photograph of her here in my bundle. HMS Kenrix and I mean the, it was a collier and we were taking coal, I mean our object was from <LOC>Goole<\LOC> to <LOC>Poole<\LOC>. I mean having got loaded at <LOC>Goole<\LOC> which is like inland from <ORG>Hull<\ORG> you went up the Humber a little bit and these trains come along and just tip up and the dust I mean everywhere was saturated with dust, it would slide into the hold and suddenly you’re full up. Anyway going down the Humber the skipper said to me, our main argument (armament- is what should have been said) on a little ship coaster, they’d be three gunners aboard that’s all we had, three gunners ‘If you like you can try your gun” So, I had a blast away, I tried to just miss a buoy you know. Anyway having done that I see the chief engineer below deck he said “For God’s sake before you fire that gun another time tap on the deck- because it’s unbelievable the noise down there. I didn’t appreciate that and there we were at sea.    Convoy, you were always in convoy on that east coast because of E-boats were quiet frequent, you know German e-boats. We’d pick up escorts and more escorts from The Wash they’d come out <ORG>MTB<\ORG>’s come out you know. Having got in the <LOC>Southend<\LOC> area there’s a boat there, the convoy sort of sails past this boat and as you come by there’s a hailer “Where you from and where you bound?” So it’s from <LOC>Goole<\LOC> to <LOC>Poole<\LOC> and we had another gunner lower down honestly on deck from this ship and all he’d bring was his toothbrush and what ever and to get through the channel, to go through the channel at night because they were at times, although we got through alright, they were bombing from Dover from <LOC>Europe<\LOC> to that coast line. I mean at one period one convoy we went into there’s a deep sea ships would come all round the coast and join us and suddenly we ran into fog and at that period they were on tacking well that means you know suddenly, I was off duty but I was on the deck and we’re a little coaster and suddenly I see this whacking great deep sea ship making direct for us and I thought I’m too late to ring the bridge they can’t alter course and this is a true story and cause your life boats hang over board as you know on a little coaster you’d have a lifeboat hanging each side and they hit the life boat and the life boat and we lost the lifeboat , but we got out of it. We had a few days in port there and a new lifeboat fixed. Did you ever come into contact with any German e-boats? Never. Never, it was still the luck of the draw really. But another amusing thing I mean the skipper his wife come down by train and I mean in his cabin he had a four poster bed with the old brass knobs on the bed job you know on the corners and he said “Gunner,” he said “brass up these knobs once a week and there’s sixpence for you” It’s a laugh now but I mean it was a pint of beer. Yer. . Anyway, this one time going north to get to the Humber again, why this time the crew were so friendly, and all I remember I’m aft on the <LOC>Oregan<\LOC> and you know keeping watch, looking round and suddenly two sides of the bridge there was a bloke who was on the wheel and there was a second mate on the other side and they put their hands up and said “Look – no hands”. I mean its ridiculous I know but we was in convoy, yer, things like that you know it’s a friendly old crew you know-very friendly. Were you ever worried on those convoys, because they were attacked quite a lot weren’t they? They were, but never no. There was on the next ship I was on. How long were you on the Kenrix?    Well I mean, you were suddenly allowed leave. A case it’s up to you I mean I could have stayed aboard her. But Obviously you like to have a leave, you know when your entitled to leave you apply and you leave the ship and then come back to that port and you pick another ship up. This I did I went home on leave, come back and I picked up the <LOC>Cambrian<\LOC> <LOC>Coast<\LOC> another coast boat and she was running from <LOC>Kirkcaldy<\LOC>, <LOC>Scotland<\LOC>, to <LOC>London<\LOC>. . It was quite good I mean cause one day at winter time I was in <LOC>London<\LOC> for the Christmas and up in <LOC>Scotland<\LOC> for the New year. Och aye. Friendly old crowd. What year was that? I can’t give you the year – well I mean I was called in 1941 so your talking about ’42 . . It’ll be 1942 I can’t give dates Can I ask which port division were you assigned to? Were you a <LOC>Chatham<\LOC>? I was a <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> rating but I never got to <LOC>Chatham<\LOC>. You were a <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> rating and that was it. . Never got to Chatham- no Did you ever have any issues with other ratings? Port ratings or was it did you have a pride to be a <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> rating? Well, I mean my Dad was a <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> rating. I mean he finished up as a signalman, a chief petty officer. On one trip, we had to on the way going north we had to call into <LOC>Middleborough<\LOC>, so we didn’t go along side we anchored cause the actual town was quite inland any way we anchored in the harbour, there was a harbour there. So, to get ashore we had to a little liberty boat and I’d never sculled, I don’t know if you’ve ever done any sculling in your life, they lowered the little boat in to get the chaps ashore and I learnt to scull I didn’t go ashore but I was so happy getting lads ashore and picking them up again I thought it was wonderful. Again, by this time again 3 gunners, they’d be three gunners on board again. Well, I had a colleague <PER>George<\PER>, he was a Londoner and he had a gold tooth and he was quite a lad, he was a barrow boy sort of thing. He spent his spare time writing out 3d a pound pears on a bit of paper type of thing. Quite a lad, so <PER>George<\PER> was a shore so anyway suddenly up anchor and we’re away and <PER>George<\PER> is not with us so I thought oh! God so I thought, oh! You should have reported it, but I didn’t. If he’s got the sense to come up by train and pick us up you know no body’s going to know anything about it, if he come up by night. Well, ongoing into port, in <LOC>Kirkcaldy<\LOC> the procedure was the gunners helping to take the lifeboats in and as a mate I mean I was the below deck so “ Come on you bloody gunners come up were getting the life boats in” ‘Where’s <PER>George<\PER>?” So, I had to tell the first mate. So I said well I’m afraid he’s not here hopefully he’ll come up tonight. He said “Well, we’ll leave it but if he comes in nothing no problem. But, if he don’t I’ve got to inform the skipper he’s missing” I often thought if we’d been torpedoed on the way up and <PER>George<\PER>, I don’t know what he’d of done, I don’t know whether he’d have reported it you know- it could have been one of us that had sunk. Anyway <PER>George<\PER> turned up and he’d got with a young lass, he’s late whether he stayed with her the night I don’t know but any way he came up by train. So, he were saved. Again we’ve now left <LOC>Kirkcaldy<\LOC> heading south suddenly they realise no cook and the cook- the skipper said to me, cause they’d only be three gunners and I mean we used to have the cook would cater and serve us only a little cabin and a half where we used to eat our meals. . I mean he’d look after the skipper and mate and the first and second mate and the engineer, the first engineer, the second engineer, the crew looked after themselves they had the use of the cooker, you’d fuel it with coal so you couldn’t control any heat. “Pitcher” he said,” you’ll cook” So, I had to do the cooking- I was doing fine until we hit heavy weather- I was seasick! Any way that was it. I got over it, we survived .Yer. What was the galley like on something like that? Well, it was just, I mean a cook was a professional cook, he was a good cook, well he got his stores, but I don’t know whether he was suppin’ up on shore or what. But you’d have thought they’d have checked before all hands on board. Nothing though and away we went. How did you personally feel leaving a ship when you’d had a nice time with the crew? Oh! Horrible because you got to make new friends and get used to other people, it is horrible- well you couldn’t imagine that because I mean life at sea wasn’t all that happy. Really, you was tense a lot of the time. Yep (is it recording now or not?) yes I mean from that aspect but well as I say there’s quite a story here really. I wasn’t the only one on this first trip on a <PER>Silverstone<\PER>. Can I ask what did you think of the <PER>Silverstone<\PER> when you first saw her? Well, I mean (are we recording?) well my first I done my watch, my quarters were aft, we had a four inch an old four inch gun aft from the last war and I saw a rat- well I’m a country lad you don’t keep rats. I told um, which is probably why they didn’t take to me. I said come on rats; you don’t want rats “Oh! That’s <PER>Joey<\PER> we feed him” I said well I don’t feed rats. . I went and got a trap off the mate, baited it, caught it and killed it! So that was the end of that so whether they took a liking I don’t know. Can I just ask as well, I mean most of your sea ship, seamanship now is being coastal how did you feel going out to…   Deep sea? West? Well, it was quite an experience really I mean obviously the old <LOC>Atlantic<\LOC> is a bit tricky but, well I mean every day you get the old <ORG>Sunderland<\ORG> and come and circle the convoy, be flashing of lights and contact and all of that and we’d say they’re away home again, they’d be home at their own base at night. Anyway we finally come in through this harbour so, I can’t think of the name of the harbour, anyway <LOC>Nova<\LOC> <LOC>Scotia<\LOC> there’s an island there, there was a harbour, finish all guns you can unload your guns and that’s it-so we’d all unloaded ours, back in the mess and brewing up having a cup of tea, well suddenly this lad, who you know it was his first trip to sea I think, he come in with a Marlin gun I think he had, well with a Marlin gun the trigger, I think it was used in aircraft as well, was a sort ‘L’ shaped job and then you fired it. Well, we’re all sitting round supping our coffee and he flung it on to the mess table ‘I can’t unload the bloody thing “ prittttt- the tracer round the mess honestly the tracers and the armour piercing through the ships side we’re all down on the deck. Well, of course there is that one blast and we’re all down and they stop it the triggers released the mere fact of hitting it on the deck hitting it on the edge of the mess table started it. So, it was the luck of the draw you know. Nobody didn’t tell the skipper or nothing like that. I mean he’s one of forecast you can’t handle a bloody gun do you? No! That was that and the other thing on the same trip my first trip on her when I was off duty I walked round the deck I mean your off duty you can do as you wish if you don’t want to sleep I saw this hose and I thought oh! the weather was warm what about a shower and I saw this stop cock and I had a little go and nothing and I suppose I’d switched it off I don’t know any way one of the things , I didn’t know at the time, that was the magazine for all our 4 inch guns- to fire it you push your shell in , ram it home and then you put a cordite in a silk bag in and then a sparky was to fire it . Well, they come aboard to see if we’d had any action, which we hadn’t and examined it you know “Where’s your ammo, where’s your ammunition?” “In the locker”…. I’d flooded the locker please don’t say anything I did say, “Please sir, I did it”. So, I kept quiet but I mean no problem, took it all ashore, and dried it out. The cordites in silk bags- you can dry it out. It’s one of those things but that was I should have reported it I suppose I didn’t know you see. I mean there should have been a lock on the thing but there wasn’t so I done wrong there.    Anyway we had a trip ashore we was allowed one trip ashore at <LOC>Montreal<\LOC>, it was <LOC>Montreal<\LOC> wasn’t it, well, we had a trip ashore and the lights were all on it was lovely, we done shopping for the girls. I mean, well you know we were all lads 20, 21,22, the bloods rising type of thing and well we’d got a girlfriend at home you know could you just put that dress on and what ever and put that brassiere on, have a twirl round and we did all this. They fell in it was lovely it was great. Anyway that was it and then we went down further and picked up wheat from another port and away out to sea again. I mean they tell me the <PER>Lawrence<\PER> freezes up in the winter and we were praying there was going to be a heavy frost, but no we was out back to sea again, out to sea again. Anyway finally we come in to <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Shields<\LOC> with the cargo, this cargo of wheat I mean we had tanks, which they welded to the top deck and that’s where you ride there. . Well, I didn’t get on to well with the, I couldn’t somehow, I wasn’t part of it, I don’t know whether its cause I killed their rat, I don’t know I wasn’t getting on too well with the crew so I thought well I did have a problem with the a wisdom tooth so I thought well I’ll go sick and get off. So, that was it and what a do the wisdom tooth. When you say you weren’t getting on very well with your crew, I mean how does that manifest itself on a ship for somebody who doesn’t know what life is like on a ship. How did you feel why did you feel that way? Well, it’s a funny feeling I mean it’s rather suppose like a marriage that’s gone wrong you’d like to get out, rid of it really I wish I could. . I did have problems with my wisdom tooth – well I thought I’d use that to get off the ship but funnily enough having said that that ship was clobbered on the next, what I’m thinking I’ve lead a very, well a fortunate life I suppose I survived and that ship was sunk and I’ve got all the details here, was sunk the next trip. What was it like to get on to a new ship? Well, lovely because everything was brand new, everything was brand new so yes so from that aspect. What was your mess like? Ah, well just an ordinary mess, we slept in bunks it wasn’t hammocks- you slept in bunks so you were reasonably comfortable, quite comfortable. Where was that sailing then? Well, I well remember I mean we actually loaded and we didn’t know where we were going but we loaded at <LOC>Leith<\LOC>, come out of the Tyne, yes the Tyne, to <PER>Leith<\PER> travelling north to load and that was a sort of a general sort of cargo and cause it turned out to be the torch effort by <LOC>Algiers<\LOC> where the <ORG>Yanks<\ORG> and the British went into <LOC>Algiers<\LOC> <LOC>Casablanca<\LOC> and <LOC>Iran<\LOC> , So er, What is said So what was your cargo do you know? General cargo, I mean they’ll be guns we took guns aboard and general <ORG>NAFFI<\ORG> stores, general cargo. Did you have any sense that this was a different convoy? Well, we just didn’t know. We were not told anything on that score so we just accepted it. It wasn’t till we got sort of down nearer the Meddy that we knew we was involved somewhere in the <LOC>Mediterranean<\LOC>. So, I mean that first trip we got through, got into port, and discharged our cargo and away back- we went back to <LOC>Newport<\LOC> in <LOC>Wales<\LOC> to another cargo and away we went to sea again and we knew then we were going back to <LOC>Algiers<\LOC> again. Can I ask you about <LOC>Algiers<\LOC> because it was quite a big convoy wasn’t it? Well, it was. I mean when we finally, when we finally went through the straits of <ORG>Gib<\ORG>, well initially before we went through the Straits we were actually bombed with a high level bomber coming over, it was so high but I mean our guns couldn’t touch it but we had on the deck a we had a rescue launch which we had ex pilots who I don’t know whether they’d lost their nerve or what but they were going to crew these rescue craft if any ship was in problems in the <LOC>Mediterranean<\LOC>, that was the idea. Well, they said after the trip I may even have got a bucket out there with if you wanted a drop of rum- you had a sip which they did. Well, I said well you know well they said we were used to dropping bombs we’re not used to being here where they are coming down. So, anyway that was that. Anyway we finally got through bigger escorts come out of <ORG>Gib<\ORG>, we had a destroyer and I think we had a cruiser with us. Oh! you think well we’re safe here now; cause the other trip went ok. But, no we weren’t we were torpedoed – we got a hit for’ard and um well immediately – I mean having been hit the hatch covers are blown up in the air there are bits of timber which covers the hatch, well as one come down one of the long bits of wood it landed on a wire which ran from the funnel to the bridge, well that sets off the siren, well a long blast on the siren is abandon ship. Well, well I mean we weren’t sinking although we were well listed the skipper immediately left the convoy and started making for the shore this would be more or less opposite <LOC>Oran<\LOC> we were sort of a nights trip from <LOC>Algiers<\LOC> where we were making for. So, panic aboard, no I mean these lads come up from the engine room with all their little suitcases trying to clamber, well they couldn’t we were listing well they were trying to get in the lifeboats. . Well, the ship wasn’t sinking so we had to get rifles out to get um “come on get back down below deck we’re alright we’re safe, we’re going, we’re still under way. So, that was it Who were these people below?    They were mostly Indians, they weren’t English, they weren’t English they – I don’t know about the engineer whether he was – he wasn’t coming up – I don’t know what he was doing – he didn’t know how to handle it really, well who did? When your hit you don’t quite know um I mean suddenly there’s a list in as much all as you could see the cargo and guns and everything just sliding into the <LOC>Mediterranean<\LOC>. It’s clear water you could actually see the stuff just floating – it cleared that hold out entirely. A <PER>Corvette<\PER> left the convoy and escorted us, cause guns were useless we listed too much we couldn’t use anything but we weren’t attacked on the coast. I was thinking I’m wondering whether that coastline would be mines, but anyway we made <LOC>Algiers<\LOC>. Having got in, being listed we tied up alongside in <LOC>Algiers<\LOC> and the army was now established ashore and they would come in to discharge the ship ,you know, handle the derricks and everything and discharge . . Well, we got friendly with them, and you know we used to feed them because they’d come aboard we had plenty of food aboard and on this particular morning “Where’s old so and so this morning?” and course he has his “Well, he got stopped at the gates on the way out last night and he had thirteen pair of pants on” Obviously he saw to flog them on shore I suppose I don’t know. I mean we had <ORG>NAFFI<\ORG> stores, we had all that type of thing, we had everything aboard there. Yer. Where exactly were you when the torpedo hit? What was your first reaction? Well, panic really. I mean what do you do? The noise is deafening, immediately it takes a list. Well, I mean once you start to list the waters pouring in that hole /hold obviously the cargo is going out so, I mean having said there’s a list you could still- it’s like walking up a hill- but we were still afloat. You were very lucky to be………. We were lucky – we were lucky. Well, I mean having got in harbour, I was telling the story there. Well finally having the army lads discharge this cargo we then got in another part of the harbour and um I mean most of us was allowed ashore, we went ashore and everything. Well, then we had a bombing raid in the harbour and I think, I think the ship that was in there as well, I think that was what they were after <ORG>HMS<\ORG> <ORG>Sussex<\ORG>, I’m not sure but I think that’s what it was a cruiser. Anyway, well they missed her and hit us and we got hit the same exactly the same and she just broke up in the harbour. She just sunk in the harbour and nobody was killed. I mean a lot of us was ashore. But, I mean with the commotion we got back and I think the skipper told quite a story. . I think he was having a shower or something. I don’t know quite what happened there but anyway nobody was killed. What is said It’s interesting because you know you’ve had a pretty inoffensive war really until you got to <LOC>Gibraltar<\LOC> you’ve been torpedoed and you’ve been bombed. How were you reacting to real war situations now- can you remember? Well I think it comes automatic – I think it comes automatic. I mean we’d seen other ships sunk. I mean at sea suddenly you’d see a destroyer, I mean we were always in convoy you’d see a destroyer put a, I think they used to put a black flag up and they’d come through the convoy just dropping depth charges and I mean , in fact I well remember one convoy the ship broke down , a lot of old ships, some of the old ships merchant ships were very old and it broke down and they had to tow it into Gib. But um the old ship, your ship would think you’d been hit cause there was a terrific movement of water a surge of water when they’re dropped yer. So had you seen ships being sunk around you by then? Well, again we had that one actually when I was on the Cambrian Coast, one ship we were picked up in convoy and a ship ahead got sunk, one of the little coasters got sunk and well you heard the bang and suddenly the ship had gone. So, I mean you just plod on you don’t know the situation. . There was usually, they’d be a ship a tug go a stern of the convoy to pick up the survivors, so they’d pick up survivors. Yer. What is a gun layers course and why did you go on that? Well, it’s a step up from the seaman gunner, which I was, you got, I don’t know what, a little bit of an increase in wages and as I was on coastal ships I was the other two were seaman gunners you were in charge of the gunnery so from that aspect and you got a rise in wages and this was done at <PER>Leith<\PER> and I mean in the end you had to go to sea to fire off, there’s a little story there , on a little coaster and a biddy and the skipper to pass you out on this course to pass as a gun layer and you had to fire a twelve pounder gun , different positions on the gun and the procedure if , if the gun failed to fire according to the annual you just put it to safety and leave it but the bloke in charge of it he just opened the breach took it out and said “ Gun,” now what was it , he give an order and threw it over board and then carried on with his lesson. But, I mean that was not according to the book. But, I mean if that gun couldn’t use it we couldn’t pass because we was at sea – so that’s how it went on. Anyway I passed that. I mean another one I had to go in one of these where the bloke in charge was sitting and they got these rockets each side which they fire and as your learning the trade you’d sit beside one bloke one side and the bloke in charge here and he fired these rockets, well the poor bloke do you know there was blood coming down his nose I mean when they go off it’s unbelievable. Cause they’re on ships, not on merchant ships they’d be on a cruiser or whatever – there’s terrific noise. . So, you had to pass that. This was done at somewhere on the south/east coast – <LOC>Hartlepool<\LOC> area where we went – yer. What is said Well the next ship you did was the <PER>Malayan<\PER> <PER>Prince<\PER>… and that was an unusual cargo, just tell me about that. Were you in convoy with that cargo? Malayan Prince, hang on I’ve got to think on that one. Oh! Yes we had a very unusual cargo here, we loaded, this was money, it was printed in <LOC>Britain<\LOC> and we had to take this out to <LOC>Alexandria<\LOC> in <LOC>Egypt<\LOC>. . So, having got out there when it was being discharged we had to have rifles own stand on guard quite a bit of money passed hands there I assume.Yer. You went through the Suez Canal… What was that like? Well, I did remember one thing I told you I had to learn the art of hairdressing – I went as an apprentice. <PER>Malayan<\PER> <PER>Prince<\PER> was quite a biggish ship, it was a twin screw so we were Commodore ship going through the <LOC>Mediterranean<\LOC> so we had a Commodore on board so I’m aft in our quarters and they sent one of the boys down, down below decks to see me “Will you, they say from the bridge they tell me there’s gunner down there that can cut hair – the Commodore wants a hair cut, would you come up and give him hair cut?” Well, I mean just by hand clippers, so I mean I did it I well remember doing one bloke at sea, just an ordinary rating – well army lad where we had a <ORG>Bofors<\ORG> we had an army crew come down for a hair cut down the mess . Well, I give him a haircut but I give him a Mohican haircut, if you understand me, he had a tuft which he didn’t know he had down, he went back to his mess and come back “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” I said well it’s only a joke come on I’ll put it right. Well, any way went off and there was the skipper, the commodore we’re up on the boat deck in the <LOC>Mediterranean<\LOC> it’s a lovely day and there’s me with my hand clippers giving the commodore a hair cut, I never spoke about it I’m only the lower decks really so um, having done it he said “Well, I haven’t got any money on me at the moment gunner but see me at <PER>Alex<\PER> , I’ll see you get a bit of money for it sort of thing ” So, that was it so we arrive in <PER>Alex<\PER> well I knew he’d be going a shore so obviously I’m sort of on deck looking up and he I see him sort of go over to the skipper and I don’t know I suppose he give me a couple of bob or something like that he went ashore . Yes, that was the end of him. Was he nice? Oh! Quite pleasant , quite pleasant . Yes. Well he was getting a cheap haircut wasn’t he and at sea. And the <PER>Talma<\PER> was an interesting ship, it was a hospital ship?    Well, she was a very old ship, old ship but. I mean we had all English doctors, nurses aboard so I mean we didn’t have much to do with them really apart from the different ports we went to we had to do sabotage watch. . I well remember one place this was at <LOC>Calcutta<\LOC> you sort of walked round the firm had a Indian bloke there to make sure the right chaps were coming aboard and I well remember him turning round one bloke he said “Him no good <PER>Johnny<\PER> him sick cock” So, I don’t know whether he’d got venereal disease I don’t know. But then he’d go and make me a cup of tea and things like that, so friendly, yes. Did it; was it a different experience at this point to the war I mean is it any more enjoyable period? Well, yes I mean the war with <LOC>Germany<\LOC> is over but at this period I mean the Japs, I mean the thing with <LOC>Singapore<\LOC> that’s where we were bound for. Well, I mean there we spent quite a bit of time having got up to <LOC>Calcutta<\LOC>, by this time the British had re-conquered <LOC>Rangoon<\LOC> on the <LOC>Burma<\LOC> side and we were going down the <LOC>Ganges<\LOC> over to <LOC>Rangoon<\LOC> with Indian troops, leave them there, coming back, more troops and that’s what we were doing for quite a while. Then finally the convoy left <LOC>Rangoon<\LOC> and cause we had the big boys with us then making for <LOC>Singapore<\LOC> that was the idea. So, I mean going down that coast I was friendly with the sparks and he kept me informed he said “Well, we just had a phone call come through, not a phone be a message come through the <ORG>Yanks<\ORG> have just dropped two atom bombs and the Japs have apparently surrendered” So, well that was a good news that I mean to go into <LOC>Singapore<\LOC> that was we’d be well armed so all we done really was mine sweepers ahead of us and we just sailed into <LOC>Singapore<\LOC> and the being a hospital ship we was tied up, we were tied up alongside and cause prisoners of war flocked to the docks and well we had food aboard but obviously nature you’d say you know well obviously give him something . . Course they stopped all that, we weren’t allowed cause they had to be bought back to life again, you know on a normal diet, they couldn’t eat a sandwich as you put it. They were shocking. What did they look like? Well, thin obviously thin. But, they stopped all that. But, were you shocked when you saw them? Well, they were in a state they were horrible Yes, I expect you’ve seen photographs of them – horrible, yes horrible. How did you, do you remember how you felt when you saw things like that? Well, I don’t think, you got used to everything, you accepted it I mean we was quite interested with I don’t know what officer we had there we had a ship there anchored the other side, I think it was going to take the Japanese surrenders. . I’m not sure who it was but again I knew at the time I’ve forgotten the years have gone by, many moons have gone by haven’t they. What is said Can I ask how do you reflect on the war now? Well, well I’m glad to be alive and you know and pleased I survived. I mean cause a lot of the lads lost weren’t they – lost a lot of boys – yes. . Sorry I’m stammering now – it’s emotion - sorry – Glad to have done your bit then? Well, yes yes. End of
 My name is <PER>John<\PER> <PER>Douglas<\PER> <PER>Woodward<\PER>. I’m 89 years old, I was born on the 7th April 1924. [Sniffs] When in the service I had originally joined to be a signaller, and they found out I was colour blind. So I was automatically transferred to a, the a stewarding branch, which I didn’t want but you had no choice you did what you were told. And I got transferred to minesweepers. And I was based on the Isle of <LOC>Sheppey<\LOC> at Queenborough-. <LOC>Queensland<\LOC>. Queenborough Pier. . And we had about 10 minesweepers there. We went out every couple days to sweep any mines that had been dropped by … boats in the hope of sinking our supply ships. Why did you join the Because I wanted to get in the fight, I didn’t want to be left behind. At the time I was what they call, in the reserved occupation. I was an apprentice as an electrical engineer. And my Dad didn’t want me to, to join up, he was in the last war. And he would’ve preferred me to learn a good, steady trade. But I wanted to go so as soon as I was [pause] 18 I went over from <LOC>Maidstone<\LOC>, where our home was, I came over to <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> to <ORG>Pembroke<\ORG> <ORG>Barracks<\ORG> and signed up. . I said I was 19 but it didn’t matter because they just accepted you. If you could breathe in and out and move your arms you were physically fit. I was told to go home and wait and I’d be contacted. And about a week later the envelope came, report to <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> <LOC>Barracks<\LOC> on such and such a day. I went right through the war without actually seeing the German. We had long range fights with them but we never actually saw a German. But <PER>John<\PER>, you wanted to do your bit, but why did you not join the <ORG>Army<\ORG> or the I’m not interested in either, and it’s traditional in my family. My father was in the navy, so was my grandfather and an uncle. My grandfather was on <PER>Beatty<\PER>’s flagship, The Lion, at the Battle of <LOC>Jutland<\LOC>, and he didn’t come on deck for three days, he was in the Engineering branch. But that’s the service I wanted to join so I did. And what do you remember of your training? It’s rather confuse when you’re young, you don’t take things in so easily. But from <LOC>Pembroke<\LOC> <LOC>House<\LOC>--<LOC>Pembroke<\LOC> <LOC>Barracks<\LOC>, we were all marched down to, the a, further down the yard where we got fitted out. And at that time everyone, unless they were an officer, wore the same. Four and a … rig, with bell-bottoms, the scarf, and the, and the a, the hat. Sent up to <LOC>Skegness<\LOC> with another bunch to Butlins holiday camp, and that became HMS Royal Arthur. . And I was to start training as a telegraphist, signaller and I been doing <PER>Morse<\PER> code. Started on the <PER>Morse<\PER> code for about a fortnight, then somebody said ‘ooh, this lot haven’t had a, a colour test, they’d better have it.’ Most of them passed, but two others and me were all strongly colour blind, so you’re out. If you send the wrong colours when you’re signalling it could be a disaster. So that’s when I was transferred onto minesweepers on the Stewarding branch. Were you disappointed? Yes. Nobody liked being on minesweepers, we all kept putting in for transfer to something more glamorous. Destroyers, submarines, <ORG>MTB<\ORG>’s, MGB’s, but always got turned down. ‘You’re doing an important job, you will stay put,’ and that was it. How many people on one of these minesweepers? How--what was the ship--the boat Five officers, and about 12 to 15 crew. That includes the, the engineers, or the Stoker branch as they call it, signalling, and, and those doing the actual mine detecting. When we first started and went out minesweeping, it was three days on, one day off. And we had two seamen standing in the bows with rifles. When they saw a mine that was floating by, they’d shoot at it, hit the holes and blow it up. But that was when they started the minesweeping campaign, and they, the Germans when they dropped them, had long weights on wires so they just floated below the surface to hit the ship. If one of those wires came loose the mime would bob onto the surface, and that’s one of the things we looked for each time we went out. When the Germans occupied <LOC>France<\LOC>, they course got right on the coastline, and they had big guns and the …. and they used to pop away at us every time we came out. . And fortunately, we never got hit. There was one amusing anecdote: our commodore had been a senior captain before the war, and he retired of course, and he was brought back in and made commodore of the minesweeping fleet He had his 12 minesweepers, and we used to go out and do the same thing every day. The Germans being very meticulous would come out, we’ll say, Friday’s and Tuesday’s, not only the same day but the same time, to lay their mines and then dash back in. We went out the following morning each time to pick them up, and the skipper got a bit fed up with this, and he told the conference of his captains one day, he said ‘next time we go sweeping, run your trawls out, but don’t drop any wires. .’ Which is of course contrary to all naval instruction and you could have got a court martial if anything happened. But we went through the German minefield as they’d laid it, and we got away with it. So, the Germans came out again to replace the mines they thought we’d picked up, and they lost four of their own boats on their own mines. And I don’t think they thought that was very sporting. When we went out, I was due to report with six other stewards, we reported to the first lieutenant. We’re damage control party. If the ship got hit, we had to clear the damage away, put out any fires and pull the wounded into the war room where the doctor was waiting to do what he could. But fortunately it never happened, but that was my official station. And what about bad weather and storms and stuff? Did you ever encounter any dangers? Oh, we had some, yes. But we still went out, you just put on your … and that was it. We had safety lines rigged fore and aft so you hold onto those, you wouldn’t get washed overboard. What was it like watching the planes taking--going over you and stuff? Did you see much activity in the We went--Fortunately we never got attacked from the air. I don’t think the, the Germans thought our little boats were worth wasting a bomb on. They wanted them for the capital cities or the airfields. Were you involved in D-Day at Yes. Now, a week before D-Day, the base was shut down like an oyster. Nobody could go off-duty and no-one was allowed in for security reasons, obviously. You couldn’t get any post, you couldn’t make any phone calls because it was coming up, although officially, we didn’t know that. And for about three months before D-Day, on Admiralty instructions we’d started night-sweeping as an alternative to the day shift, so the Germans would get used to the idea of us popping along the coast during the hours of darkness. They wouldn’t think anything of it. So [pause] the early morning of D-Day, we went out at midnight, and we were sweeping right up to the line where the battleships were waiting to bombard the coast. . We knew exactly where they were going to be stationed and we swept that most carefully, and then we--as they started coming out of the darkness from two o’clock in the morning and waiting, and we retired behind them. There wasn’t anything else for us to do, we got sent back here to the, the Isle of <LOC>Sheppey<\LOC>. When the troops went ashore, we were a bit annoyed because we weren’t doing anything, and then about eight or nine days later we got the orders to patrol the Dutch coast, on the … and pick up all the mines which the Germans had so liberally round all the coast there. So that kept us busy for about three weeks, and we were stationed at a little town called <LOC>Terneuzen<\LOC>, a very small port but there was a long jetty so we could moor alongside there. And in the evenings, late afternoon, you got shore leave until you were going off again next morning. And I’ve never forgotten the things we saw when we went ashore. The Germans had got out in a hurry, and their, their signs were everywhere, on the hotel lounge that had been an Officers’ Mess, and the signs were still up. And they’d blew some of the bridges over the canals as they left, and the Dutch flooded some of the … to stop their heavy traffic getting away. And I remember once, we went ashore, and we all carried the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> raincoat draped over your arm, folded in a certain way, and the officer watching you very well with your things in the pockets: cigarettes, packet of biscuits, a tin of jam or whatever, which were not supposed to be taken off the ship, and we were giving it to the Dutch civilians because they were as starved as hell, and looked very ill. . And on this occasion we got ashore, and I, I saw a very thin, haggard looking woman coming up the street, pushing her battered pram, and she got two little kids in there, about three, or a bit less I suppose, and one blanket cover them. And I …. ‘good day,’ and she gave me a smile, she couldn’t speak English and I couldn’t speak Dutch, but I took out what I had and I put it in her pram. You should’ve seen the look on her face, she must’ve thought it was Christmas come twice because what they didn’t eat they could always trade for something else. After we got rid of most of the mines off the Dutch coast, we had a week’s leave due, well obviously we weren’t coming back here for it, it would be on the Dutch coast. And I and another fellow, we got along to the main road, which was the <LOC>Brussels<\LOC> road, leading into, into <LOC>Belgium<\LOC>. We thumbed lifts from army lorries which were always going up and down, and we got into about three, three hours, no, a bit less, into <ORG>Bruges<\ORG>, which was one of the most beautiful cities I’ve seen. It’s got two cathedrals, an opera house and the town hall, round four sides of the main square, and the, one of the hotels had been taken over as a … for the troops. Bed and breakfast. So we stayed there, and we enjoyed ourselves. And when we came back we got ordered back to this country, and we were still looking for mines which might have escaped detection, be going up and down, but there wasn’t much urgency in it anymore. . And I did put in an application to sit for leading steward but before that could take place, my discharge papers came through, and that was in the, early, early 1946 After the Yeah. But unlike the <ORG>Army<\ORG> or the <ORG>Air<\ORG> <ORG>Force<\ORG>, we got plenty of notice when it was coming. I know people in the <ORG>Air<\ORG> <ORG>Force<\ORG>, and they were given three days’ notice and then they were out. But in the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> we had time, you were told you would be demobbed in 3 months. Well that gives you time to start looking round for a civilian job, or somewhere to live if you’re married with kids, so I think we had a better deal. Can you explain--you, you talk about this minesweeping. Just explain what you were doing and what happens to these mines. Well, they looked like yard zips from the main masts, stretched out either side about 50 feet. And from these … are very sharp cutting wires, with weights on the end. And as you go to the water, the idea is to, your cutting wires to catch the mooring wires for a mine, and you cut it and the mine comes to the surface and you dispose of it. How many mines would you find on an average On an average day, [pause] possibly a dozen, possibly only two. It varied. And the disposal would be a shot, would it? That’s what it started with, yes. Then the Germans eventually, the acoustic mine, which wasn’t … it was just dropped in the Channel, hopefully in the path of oncoming ships. And it emitted a magnetic field from batteries that were inside, and every ship as it goes also makes a magnetic field, and when the two collide, the mine goes up. . So we had to have what was called degaussing equipment, a special coil fitted right round the ship, allowing currents to pass through that anticlockwise, and that nullifies the effect of the electronic field. And you could go over mines and you’d be alright. Could you find those mines? We found them, yes. Sometimes the Germans got crass and they dropped some of these mines at night from low flying planes. And we got back, I wasn’t there I was at, on a couple days leave and I went home to <LOC>Maidstone<\LOC>, but I was told, our squadron came back from patrol, and the last ship in slid into its place on the jetty and promptly blew up, because there was a mine underneath been dropped by a plane. . And the skipper at this last boat, as a result of being six feet from the jetty, he got his degaussing equipment switched off. [Pause] I think there was two survivors but who they were, I don’t know. But how would you find--I can understand how you could find a mine that was floating in the water, you cut it and it floats to the surface, how did you find those magnetic mines? Were they on the bottom, They’re on the bottom, yes. How would you find Well with, like a sonar device, it picks up the radiations from the mine and you can see exactly where it is, and then you can drop a depth charge on it. You set the depth charge for 20 feet or 30, whatever it is, and just pop them over to the side on a Y-gun. In <LOC>Holland<\LOC>, when you got to <LOC>Holland<\LOC>, you talked a little bit about what you saw. . Are there any other memories of just the devastation? When the Germans got out in a hurry they took everyone with them, alive or dead. And blew a couple of bridges and then retreated towards <LOC>Belgium<\LOC>. Did you feel like you were winning the war at that stage? Yes. The great day had come, the invasion had started. And we were pushing in land from the beaches, we hadn’t been shucked back off again and it was starting to, to bite. When you were pulled out of D-Day, did you--were you, were you able to hear what was going on on D-Day? [Pause] After the battleships have arrived, you’ve come back to base. . Did you--were you around long enough to hear about the guns going off? The--When the main broadside started, yes. I think that was quarter to six, and eight miles of ships all opened up at the same time. We already got information from the underground, the resistant workers, where the German strongpoints were all along the cliff tops, heavy gun emplacements, bunkers for troops and so on. And they got continuous plastering, and they hadn’t quite finished. It was a two hour bombardment, and half an hour before it stopped the boats were going ashore with the troops. Did you hear We were on the minesweepers behind them, we heard it alright. It was such a deafening crescendo of noise, there’s nothing like it. You weren’t even near Do you remember VE Oh, that was again marvellous. I was awaiting demob, and of course we got rather more leave once peace was declared, and I got, I think it was a four day pass, to go home to <LOC>Maidstone<\LOC>. And we came up on the train to <LOC>Victoria<\LOC> and the place was just one seething mass of people. Every colour, every uniform, everything you could think of, everyone was singing, dancing, laughing with complete strangers because they let their hair down. . And in front of <LOC>Buckingham<\LOC> <LOC>Palace<\LOC>, you couldn’t got a shoehorn in, there were hundreds of thousands stretching back down the Mall, waiting for the King, Queen and <PER>Winston<\PER> to come on the balcony. And the roar that went out must’ve gone on for about 10, 15 minutes non-stop. How do you reflect on your <ORG>Navy<\ORG> service I’m glad, I’m glad I went. Means I and thousands of others don’t have to read about history, we were making it, we were part of that history, and I think it’s something to be proud of. Are there any other stories you want to share? I don’t think there’s any, no. As I say, minesweeping is a very dull occupation with occasional short periods of activity. But unlike destroyers or battleships, you, you’re not engaged permanently with the opposite number. Were there any occasions where you were engaged? No. We were never attacked by planes, as I said, and we didn’t see any German troops. The only contact we had was when their long range guns on the French coast tried to get us while we were minesweeping. But they, they didn’t. What is said End of
 My name is <PER>Rodney<\PER> <PER>Newham<\PER> and I was born in 1920, and I; when I was 15 I had an apprenticeship in <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> dockyard, and for five years, and then I served a time on most of the ships that came in; on repairing. I was in the boiler making trade more than anything else. The boiler rooms and engine rooms were the ones that, the ones I was employed in. . And, I knew more about the ships than some of the sailors knew, because I used to know every part of the ship, even down into the shafts room, the room of the shaft - which goes through and drives the propeller, and one of my jobs was to put safety shields over the joints of the shaft going through the ship. I knew about most of the ships, were all different; the engine and boiler rooms more than anything, and the air supplies and things like that. When I was about 15 we sat in exams for artisan apprentices or dockyard apprentices. And at that time I wanted to go into the navy, but at that time they wouldn’t accept you in the, as an engine room artificer if you had glasses, because ships in those days, a lot of steam come from the boilers so you never, you couldn’t do it, so I went in as an apprentice in <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> dockyards and served 5 years, that was 1936. In those days even when you came out of the dockyard gates children were begging there in bare feet for your sandwiches that you had over, and you used to give them to the children who were there waiting for the dockyard people to come out, so that they could get these sandwiches. It doesn’t seem possible does it but that’s true, yes. I had a sister who was seven years older and I had a brother who was 7 years younger; and what happened to him, I never knew, I never knew. But my sister; she lived until about 83 I think, something like that; with my sister, yes. And, my father, was a chief engineer in art in the navy, he did his 22 years you know. . And, my mother died when I was 8, so I never really knew a mother’s love and care from the age of 8, no, so I can’t say that I had a happy childhood as such; not having a mother’s care. What do you remember of your early apprenticeship at <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> dockyard, what were you actually, was there a sense of war? Were you, were you building up to war or was it just a job for you at the time? Well at 1936 I went into the dockyard as an apprentice, a 5 years apprenticeship, ‘36, in that time, the war broke out at ‘39, that’s right, and so I was serving the apprenticeship actually when the war broke out, yes. When it was, when I finished, I was then a qualified boiler maker which was a hard job, hard work, so I determined at that time that I wouldn’t stay as a boiler maker. So I made progress in the trade and I eventually became an inspector of trades, in the dockyard, that’s what I retired as; an inspector of trades. It’s a, The apprenticeship of a boiler maker was a hard job; it’s a heavy, heavy material job. if you can imagine, the boilers they weren’t modern, they were what we used to call the arrow boilers, cylindrical boilers; made of metal an inch thick and we used to roll it into shape. Imagine they were big, they were up to thirty ton, the cranes used to have to lift that, yes. It was heavy, hard work, boiler making was, yes I know of a number of people that were killed, when; one of them, he had a plate dropped from a crane, it slipped out of the grip, fell on him and killed him, yes, it were terrible. And I remember a man, being killed, on, the cranes used to go up and down on rails lifting the heavy, well, lifting thirty odd tons, and one man was crushed up in the night, and it was a naval officer who actually went up there, up the steps, as you can imagine the steps were locked so that no, that other people couldn’t get up, but He went up there to retrieve the body or to see if he could do anything more for the body. . A very brave man; a naval officer lieutenant he was, as plain as if it were yesterday, yes, yes, yes, and, it was hard. Did you notice, did you notice; to talk a bit about this escalation in the amount of work in terms of providing for the war effort? Well there were a number of vessels that used to come in damaged because of the war, and they would be repaired in <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> dockyard, and, and they, we used to do, make, gun shields and torpedo platforms that revolved for the torpedoes on, and we used to do those and make those platforms for torpedoes to be fired from and things like that. And gun shields we used to make, made of bulletproof metal which was very hard to work with, you know bit hard. Any other ... . came in? Yeah, the <ORG>Arethusa<\ORG> was a cruise I worked on and the... was another cruiser, and, a number of riggers and mine sweepers, and then, when we used to do the re-fits; and that would mean stripping out the boiler engine rooms and renewing a lot of the stuff - the air supply through the ventilations down to the engine and boiler rooms, through turbo generators collecting the air and distributing it around the ship, yes, that was called aluminum trunking with grills on the end of the trunking. . And you could alter the different positions through the engines in the boiler rooms, yes, I used to make those grills and fit them, and things like that. I remember the Germans coming over, was quite a number of them, I remember the, and the <ORG>Arethusa<\ORG>, the cruiser opened fire on them, and I think, I think a lot of the craft were Italians on there that had came over; because it was noticeable that the Germans would have gone on but when the <ORG>Arethusa<\ORG> opened fire on them a lot of these planes changed and turned round and went back from where they come from, you’d never believed would you, but that’s what happened! Yes, the Germans would have kept on and would have attacked their target, but I think that some of the others were Italians on there. Yes because where I should have been down under the shelter I stood up against one of the workshop walls, and that was my shelter and watched the <ORG>Arethusa<\ORG> open up, as she was in dock, and she opened up and I was stood there with my back to the wall in the workshop and I saw these men on the <ORG>Arethusa<\ORG>; stripped to the waist, firing the ships and getting the shells, empty shells and throwing them aside and loading again and firing. That was on the <ORG>Arethusa<\ORG>, yes, they were really good, they were, they really, really turned those planes around; an experience. Course, I ought to been down in the shelter but I didn’t go down there. Yes, I was given one to go to, it was just a, well it was a dugout, and you went down steps, and, that was there, but I wouldn’t go down there; I stood with my back to the wall in the workshop, yes. Not that I was brave at all, it’s just that I wouldn’t go down the shelters. . I’d rather take a chance. ???? In the war, when you weren’t in the dockyard, or were you living in the dockyard as well? No I lived, I lived outside of the dockyard, yes, I lived in <LOC>Gillingham<\LOC> road for a time, near the railway crossing, you know that part of <LOC>Gillingham<\LOC>, and I lived with my father there, yes cos’, because my mother died when I was 8, but I went and lived with my dad. I think we knew that we’d, put it like this, that we’d win in the end, that we would be the victors as a nation; because I think that the effort, everybody was behind the war effort as far as I know, yes, yes. I suppose it was, you weren’t paid a lot of money, you, some people made a lot of money because of the war, but we were never like that, we never made a lot of money because of the war being on, and, it was hard work; these great big slabs, I used to do things on, with a vice, a heavy vice one end of it. And I used to roll plates and cylinders out of inch thick material, and I used to work in the furnace and pull rings out of the furnace and round ‘em up, and you used to have to have an asbestos sheet to shield yourself from the heat that came off when you pulled it out with rakes onto a slab out from the furnace. And the heat was so great that you used to hold these asbestos sheets up in front of you to protect yourself from the heat as you endeavoured with hammers, large, large hammers, to shape, to, to make them into the right shape. Sometimes they weren’t quite round and so you had to put dogs on them and shape them. You just had asbestos sheets to protect yourself from the heat. And the thing was that you was, you made things out of asbestos sheets, and you just saw it up, and all the dust, well you just breathed it all in; no wonder so many men died of asbestos. It’s a, I had, what they call, plague, in both lungs, which I’ve got now, but it never, it never solidified. Men used to breathe it and it would go solid in the lungs; but I was fortunate in that mine didn’t solidify, so it hasn’t affected me, the breathing, even up to, well now of course it does. I was fortunate, because many, many of my colleagues died at an early age because of asbestos, yes, I remember them; they were compensated a penny for it, and. I’ve never asked for compensation, and I’ve never, I’ve never worried about it, because I thought, well I have been breathing all these years, and with no affect, so I’m fortunate. And with regard to convoys and stuff what did you know about the work that you were doing about keeping convoys going?    Not a lot really; no we didn’t know a lot. We didn’t get a lot of information except what we read in the papers, you know. We just did our daily work, you know, cos’ I had to, we had to join the home guard, so very often it was a matter of coming home from work and going out to the home guard, yes, which was on beety avenue where we had a place, it was beety avenue! Where we used to sleep at night, then we’d be called out, they called it the z batteries and they were rockets and you loaded the rockets and fired at night, you know, and there were, there was two projectors and you had to load them onto a projector, which had two, and you was given the elevation and that over the phone, and you did that and then they would give you the word fire and you’d pull the lever and these two rockets went up from each side, and there was about, there was about; must have been 50 of these z battery rockets on one field, on beety avenue if I remember. And you was firing at the aircraft and you’d hear them but you could never see them cos’ it was at night mostly. And during the day, the batteries were made by regular soldiers, you know, and the home guard would do it in the evening, yes, Hear any? I never heard of any, no, to tell you the truth I never heard them, we’d actually made a hit, it was, yes, so there was two people on each one, and you’d get the, the rocket was in bunks, a number of them, and you would draw one out, ooh they were heavy; yes that big, yes, they were heavy too, and I think they were t and t, and they were heavy, and you’d run and pick one up and load it onto the rocket, and there’d be two, the rocket, and you would hear over the phone what elevation you had to set the rocket to, or the shell to, or rocket, whatever you like to call it, you’d do that and then you’d hear the elevation and that over the phone and then they’d say fire, and you’d press down and these two went up. There was a number of them on the field; there must have been, well it’s a job to say now after all this time, but quite a number. And the town’s people used to say they made a terrific noise when they went off, you know, when they were all fired at the same time, and, not a lot, not a lot, there must have been great celebrations, yes, I can’t remember a lot about it, to tell the truth. Oh cos’ we had home guard uniforms, and we were allowed to keep that, and I used to wear the trousers to work, for ages and ages i wore those home guard trousers. Dirty job boiler making was, yes. Can i ask you a question about <PER>Pembroke<\PER> house, can I ask you about <PER>Pembroke<\PER> house? Yes… How do you find living here?   In <LOC>Pembroke<\LOC> house? One of the best places you could be, really, yes, its uh, yes, I didn’t really imagine that I would be here, but it’s the best, the best that you can, I think, well its the, uh caring I think is the thing, yes, <PER>Pembroke<\PER> house, and I remember it of course when it was a girls; it was a naval children, girls, it was a girls home, <PER>Pembroke<\PER> house was when I was a boy. And I remember the girls being in their little sailors uniform, it was, yes it was true, that’s what <PER>Pembroke<\PER> house was, it was for children, girls, mostly girls, who’s fathers had been killed or some reason or other, you know that’s what they were, the girls, yeah <PER>Pembroke<\PER> house was a girls, yes a girls home, ex naval people’s children, yes. The people, you mean the carers? Very good very good, couldn’t wish for a better place really, no, no, very good. They umm, yes, I couldn’t be in a better place, I feel, at the end of my life; because they are caring and err I couldn’t be in a better place now, yes. And my daughters, my daughter, my son are glad that I’m here because they know that I’m being taken care of, yes. My daughter is able to come very, very frequently because she lives not far from here, yes right opposite, it’s the park isn’t it?, <PER>Jennifer<\PER> park. I, I have walked to my daughter’s, mind you they got onto me because I, I went out of the building, and I went along, into the park, and through the park out the other gate and along <LOC>Seeton<\LOC> road and up <PER>Cleve<\PER> road to my son in law, my daughter’s house; 64 <PER>Cleve<\PER> road, I think it’s 64, and they nearly had a fit when they come to the door and I was there, so, anyhow they got me back, no they phoned up first and told, told them here that I was there and that they were going to bring me back, yes.
 My name is <PER>Pam<\PER> <PER>Torrens<\PER>. I was four years in the WRNS and I was a chief petty officer after the first six months or so. Okay, so just, <PER>Pam<\PER>, before we get too much into your service information, just tell me a bit about where you're from. . What was life like for you pre-war? Well, I was born in <LOC>Southampton<\LOC>, into a family which was very sea-orientated, coming from a long line of sailors and fishermen. My father was a pilot and there wasn't any question as to which service I would go in to. When I reached eighteen and the family let me join up, I joined the WRNS. What do you remember of the outbreak of the war and what do you remember of the impact of war on your family? Oh. Well, the greatest impact was a German parachute dropped a mine which landed on the house behind us and killed the family outright. All four of them. Our house, which was a biggish, Victorian, solid-built and there were two other solid-built houses of Victorian style beside us, and round the back there was a small series of modern houses, and it landed on one of the modern houses. . The others were very badly damaged, ours was badly damaged and the other two were, but by the end of the month, ours was the only house standing. It had quite an impact on us. We couldn't live there until the end of the war. They repaired our house, but all the others had to be rebuilt. What year was that then? Was that . When did you sign up? How old were you? I was eighteen when I signed up in 1942. I went to the initial training in <LOC>Mill<\LOC> <LOC>Hill<\LOC> for Christmas. I was over Christmas there which was odd. It was a bit like a sort of warped boarding school, so it wasn't too strange, but of course I didn't have to scrub floors in boarding school and you do awful jobs when you're in initial training. Had you been to boarding school or anything? How did you adapt to Yes. Yes, yes. Oh, so you were able to adapt to that sort of ... It was easier; I'm sure, for me. Some girls who'd never been away from home were not happy and some of them went home after a fortnight. Not many. Just one or two who were used to being in the family all the time. When did you sort of have an, at Mill Hill ... Just talk through the procedure for weeding out the ones that might have gone off to do wire service etc. . and how did that all come about? Well, I think they start on that beforehand because my mother had to take me out to the admiralty to have a test in my German to see if it was good enough. I was just about good enough. Most people had more qualifications than I did or more knowledge because they'd lived in <LOC>Switzerland<\LOC> or <LOC>Germany<\LOC> itself. . That was already organized because whereas most girls were issued with a uniform straightaway, we were not issued until we'd been through a, as far as I remember, through a course that the special unit, in <ORG>Wimbledon<\ORG> at <LOC>Southfields<\LOC>, which trained us in the use of radios and what codes the Germans we were listening to would be using. At the end of that, we went to get our uniform because we became petty officers straightaway, so it was a different uniform. Did you go straight from <LOC>Mill<\LOC> <LOC>Hill<\LOC> to Southfields or home first? Yes. No, straight to <LOC>Southfields<\LOC>, yes. Okay. Can you just talk a bit about what you remember of <LOC>Southfields<\LOC> and where you were billeted and ... Yes. <PER>Southfields<\PER> was a nice house in <LOC>Wimbledon<\LOC> and there was a lieutenant commander in charge who'd started in the <ORG>Navy<\ORG>, I suppose about two years before, I don't know when he joined up. He had the idea of having a whole series of stations round the south and east coasts to listen out for German E-boats because they were attacking in little packs like the wolf packs of the U-boats on the <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Sea<\LOC> coast area and the channel when our ships went through. . They put a whole series of small stations, mind you, some of them were twelve WRNS, one Wren officer, in the middle of nowhere, twenty miles from the nearest naval base and nobody knew we were there or what we were doing. It was a pretty deadliest times as regards your time off, but the job itself was very interesting. You've explained the purpose of <LOC>Southfields<\LOC>. Just explain the environment of <LOC>Southfields<\LOC>, and where you were, and how your training was, and how many people were there and ...    We weren't big classes, I should think, there were only about a dozen girls at once if that. We had to learn how to use these radios and we had to use radios that worked on very high frequencies because that was the frequency that the E-boats used. The E-boats were MTBs but bigger than ours, at the beginning of the war anyway. Better armored and faster. . Ours were at a disadvantage and because they worked in packs, and they would sort of assemble in a small bay or cove, and it was difficult for radar to pick them up against the background and so on. Therefore it was very vital if we could get a DF fix, that's a bearing from two points to fix the position by radio, it helped our men to know where to take the MTBs. They were sent out if we heard ... We had to search all the time because the Germans knew we were listening by the time I joined. Therefore, they used a band of 20 MHz, but they could come up anywhere in the band so you couldn't rely on the frequency. You had to search the whole time. We were therefore called the twiddlers because of course, you had round knobs then, and you tuned along. . Any strange signal you met you tried to identify, and if you couldn't you described it because it might be a new device they were using and our people would be able to work out possibly what it was. You'd get all sorts of strange signals and of course, sometimes you were on duty and you never heard any Germans at all. Of the type that you were looking for anyway, but occasionally you did. Even if it was very faint, you could sometimes get a bearing on a faint signal. How did you know what the bearing was? You can hear the signal but ... Ah, ah yes. We had, in addition to the watch room where we did this continuous 24 hour search, we had a DF ... What were they called, a DF tower because it's a bit like a small windmill to look at, except that you don't have wheels you have a dipole area coming out of the middle of it which can be controlled from down below. You twist this big circular control which turns the dipole area and when it's in line with the signal, which you will have been told about by the watch room and you're in the DF tower, then you have to read off the reading on the band on the control. Well, it's a big sort of circular metal bar, I suppose, and let the watch room know. Then they phone it straight through to the naval intelligence center and if it was ... . Then presumably they would pass it on to the flotilla that would have to go out and deal with them, or possibly it was already out. I don't know. When you were in the south though, just to go back to <LOC>Southfields<\LOC>, where were you billeted?    Ah, yes. We were billeted probably a couple of roads away at a place called something like <PER>Rose<\PER>, <PER>Rosedean<\PER>, or Rose something or other. I can't remember. A private house which had been taken over for the Wrens, because mostly we were in good accommodation. We used to walk from there to <LOC>Southfields<\LOC> proper for our classes, or our instruction, and that went on. . Periodically you had to go back for refresher courses from your station. You'd go there for a week or a fortnight for a refresher in new things and all of a sudden, instead of being able to walk in a nice casual, relaxed way, they said you've got to march in a squad. Of course, we weren't very good at that because there was rarely enough people off duty at any one time to form a squad anyway. It's quite difficult to do a squad drill when there's only about five of you in the squad because there's always a gap somewhere. We didn't often have five off anywhere at one time, so we rebelled, and we marched and sang the Horst-Wessel-Lied. Do you know it? It's a marvelous German ... It was the <PER>Sturmtruppen<\PER> song and it had a wonderful beat for marching. Of course, nobody knew, we couldn't make much effect because it was a residential area with not many people around but we enjoyed getting our own back. There was no repercussions because they didn't hear us.  How big is <PER>Southfields<\PER> then? How many rooms is it? What is it?    Wouldn't know, I wouldn't know. You only went to your room for your class. Yes, that reminds me. I had my twenty-first birthday there and they had a dance that night, so there was a bit of a party on my birthday. . Yeah, that was strange. Southfields itself, you'd have earphones on and you'd take down whatever they said and the Germans used a very simple kind of code because they were so fast. They did about 50 knots or something. I might be wrong but they were faster than ours and because of that they use a kind of code based on the phonetic alphabet. So you'd have <PER>Anton<\PER>, [German ], <PER>Caesar<\PER> and so on. They'd put two of the letters together and make something up as a code for it and it was very simple. The only one I can remember is <PER>Sophie<\PER>, <PER>Tony<\PER> for the first letters of stopfen, which meant stop engines or stop. That was for the engine. That was the basis of the code and it was very simple to take down because you just wrote down the initial letters of the word or the letters they ... We knew a lot of them. We didn't know all of them but we knew a great deal of them or what they meant. This we copied down on a message pad which had a carbon copy below it which was kept in the station. The other one was sent to, I think was sent to <LOC>Bletchley<\LOC>. Only we didn't know it at <LOC>Bletchley<\LOC>, it was Station X, which to an eighteen year old was a very glamorous place to be involved with. There was always somebody else on duty besides you, especially during the daytime, who would take the top sheet of your message pad, immediately push the other pad over so you could carry on without pause and they would phone that through to the local naval intelligence center. Which for example, in <LOC>Portsmouth<\LOC> area, was under <LOC>Fort<\LOC> <LOC>Suffolk<\LOC>. In the <LOC>Dover<\LOC> area was under Dover Castle. I don't know if you've ever been there, but it's fascinating because it's a series of ... It's like a rabbit warren of tunnels that were built originally, some of them, by French prisoners of war back in some other war. It's been expanded since then and I was lent from <LOC>Abbot<\LOC><LOC>'s<\LOC> <LOC>Cliff<\LOC> near <LOC>Dover<\LOC> to them for either a week or a fortnight because they were short of people in the intelligence center. I saw the other Wren a bit because the messages would come through to us on the phone from the station, the operating station receiving the messages, then we would teleprint it to Station X. We didn't know where Station X was. We had no knowledge and you never knew anything more than you needed to know for your job. . We never knew whether the information we gave to the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> by this course was ever useful or not, which was sad really, but we hoped it was useful because they certainly needed the help at the beginning of the war. After <PER>Southfields<\PER>, how do you know you've passed? What do they do? Do you have to sign the Official Secrets Oh, you certainly have to sign the Official Secrets Act, yes. We were not released from it for at least thirty years. I was abroad then, and I didn't even know I could tell my family, and both parents died before I could ever really tell them what I had been doing. I was speaking to a lady yesterday at the <ORG>VJ<\ORG> <ORG>Memorial<\ORG> <ORG>Service<\ORG> in <LOC>Bournemouth<\LOC>, and she said the same. . Her parents both died and she'd never been able to tell them, and what horrifies me nowadays is that people don't seem to care whether they've signed it or not. If they can get money for their story, they will tell it, and yet there must have been tens of thousands of people who were involved in secret work and we fooled the Germans time and time again. It was wonderful, the integrity that people had then. You passed out at <LOC>Southfields<\LOC>, I assume. Yeah, because you got your uniform. Where did you go? You went <PER>Abbot<\PER>'s Cliff. . What do you remember of <PER>Abbot<\PER>'s Cliff? Well, you're four hundred feet up on a very windy cliff, I remember that. All the windows were covered with camouflage netting obviously, because we were right on the edge of the cliff and a prime target in a way. If you tried to go sleep after night watch, there'd be this beastly thing waving to and fro in the wind and flapping against ... So it was very difficult to sleep sometimes, or get to sleep. Once you'd got to sleep it wasn't too bad. How many Wrens there? There were more there because that was one of the bigger ... There were two bigger stations and that was one of them. They were bigger because they listened to other things as well as to the E-boats. In the watch room there, there were two sets. One very high frequency which the E-boats used and a high frequency which was used by more normal traffic. It was more routine German exchanges of messages between the, for example ... I remember it better when I was at <LOC>Ventnor<\LOC>, which was the other big station. We listened to the headquarters, the Headquarters of the Germans set up there. They would call every so many hours, just about two or three hours, they would keep checking all the harbor defense vessels to see that they were in order, and where they should be, and reception was good and so on. Then they'd pass other minor messages. Nothing very exciting. It was amusing at Christmas because they'd exchange Christmas greetings and things in plain language, but mostly it was the Q Code there. It was routine, but why we listened to it was because if there was any changes in the routine or different messages being sent then Station X was interested because it meant something was happening. Like the <PER>Bismarck<\PER> going through or so on, which I think it was the <PER>Bismarck<\PER> was one of the ones ... . Two of the big battleships managed to get down the channel without our knowing. How they did it I don't quite know, but they did, but usually it indicated enough for the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> to sort of have a look out and see what was happening. Otherwise that was routine. That was all in WT and the other was in RT. WT being <PER>Morse<\PER>, of course. What was it like living there? It was all right. We were only three miles really, from <LOC>Dover<\LOC> and about three miles from <LOC>Folkestone<\LOC>. You could, in time off, go to the pictures in either town or you could go and ... We didn't do much shopping those days. We didn't have much money. I think as a petty officer, I got thirty shillings a fortnight. Which is one-fifty I think now, but you didn't need much because you had your accommodation. . Your clothing was very, very cheap which you bought from the purser's store, which we called the parser's store. Things like a shirt would be one and nine pence which is about sort of twenty-five p or something. It's amazing the difference in prices. Do you remember a lot of people around <LOC>Dover<\LOC> and <LOC>Folkestone<\LOC>, or was it basically military? What is Said Oh, all of normal people were there. I had an aunt and a cousin who lived in <LOC>Dover<\LOC>. All the normal people were there and they just endured the constant, you know, they had a lot of shelling there. There were Wrens also stationed in <LOC>Dover<\LOC> itself because that's where I had to stay when I was temporarily transferred to the intelligence center there under Dover Castle. A funny thing happened during my stay there. You were permitted, if nothing was happening in the night, there was no traffic as we used to call it, in other words the Germans were no on operations that night; one of you could sleep while the other stayed awake then you changed halfway through the night. You slept on the floor in a duffle coat; there was nothing else to do. It was my turn to be on the floor. I was fast asleep when I suddenly realised somebody was near me. . I opened my eyes and there was a naval officer standing beside me, with gold braid all around here and gold braid up to his elbow. I thought oh my goodness, it's the admiral, what do I lie at attention or do I hop up? While I was looking, I should think, horrified he just quietly went away and left us. I don't know which admiral it was, but a very nice admiral it was obviously. Did you meet any of the senior admirals? Do you remember any ... Did you see <PER>Churchill<\PER> when you were in Dover? Nope, no. He wasn't there at that time. I was only there a week or a fortnight, you see. No, nobody of interest came to see us at all and we had very little to do with the <ORG>Navy<\ORG>. It was one of the things we regretted, obviously. We used to spend our spare time going for walks. If you walked over the dams far enough you could get cream tea even in the war, because they were so isolated that, you know, they were happy to sell you a cream tea. You could do that also from <LOC>Ventnor<\LOC>. You had to walk again, over the sort of dam land; inland to a little village that's still ... I can't think of the name of it. It's very well known for tourists now, and you could get a cream tea there and that was very nice. Then we'd get the bus back, but our entertainment was very limited. I can only remember going to one party from <ORG>Abbot<\ORG>'s Cliff, and it was an RAF mess in somewhere near Highs in <LOC>Kent<\LOC>. They'd taken over <PER>Siegfried<\PER> <PER>Sassoon<\PER>'s house, and the thing I most remember of it was a couple who mistook a slightly green slime there was on the little pond there, and walked straight into the pond. Possibly encouraged by a certain amount of alcohol. That was the highlight of that do. I can't remember much about it apart from just working, and walking, and doing things like that. It was never a socially good job because we were in such remote positions usually. After <PER>Abbot<\PER>'s Cliff, I was transferred to <LOC>Hemsby<\LOC> on the east coast. It was twelve Wrens, one Wren officer, a lot of sand dunes, a very cold sea and I liked swimming but I only went in once, a very cold <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Sea<\LOC> wind, and no village. Nothing except sand dunes. If you had any time off you tried to hitch a lift somewhere, to <LOC>Norwich<\LOC>. I remember us going for entertainment. . It must have been we had a Saturday off, and you could either try and get to <LOC>Norwich<\LOC> because there was an American PX there and you could actually have a dance or another night we cycled on awful station bicycles, belonging to the wireless station, but crotchety old things. Were they provided by Nuffield? Quite possibly because he did provide things for the Wrens, yes. We cycled nine miles into <LOC>Great<\LOC> <LOC>Yarmouth<\LOC>, which isn't very great even when you get there. We went to this hop, which they don't call it hop now, but it just means a very ordinary dance with a lot of rude soldiery there, so to speak. We cycled back and halfway back, the chain fell off my bicycle and this is about 10:00 at night along a country road. . Luckily two very gallant sailors caught up with us and put my chain back on and said, now don't stop pedaling until you get back, and we managed to get back. We weren't late but I suppose we would've had a good excuse. What sort of operational were you running from <LOC>Hemsby<\LOC>? Well, it was the single operation there. Just the radio telephony, looking out for E-boats. It was just that. You didn't have the other thing which I wasn't qualified to do at that time. I hadn't been on the Morse course, but I disliked <LOC>Hemsby<\LOC> so much because the flat countryside I didn't like. I was used to <LOC>Hampshire<\LOC> which is rolling, and wooded, and beautiful. I was a long way from home too, so was Dover, but I didn't miss it so much. . I had got relatives quite near and there was more going on. I realized that if I learnt <PER>Morse<\PER> they couldn't keep me at <LOC>Hemsby<\LOC>, because they didn't do it. I would either be at <PER>Abbot<\PER>'s Cliff, and I didn't know about <LOC>Ventnor<\LOC> there, but I knew there were other stations, so I think the radio mechanic there would teach you up to a certain level. I'd done it in Girl Guide, you know, zero speed, and he'd get you up to sort of ten words a minute or something. . Then you went back to, I think it was <PER>Southfields<\PER>, to have your speeds brought up to twenty-five words a minute and you were taught the German procedural methods which were marginally different from the English. Then you could be sent to either <PER>Abbot<\PER>'s Cliff or <LOC>Ventnor<\LOC> and I think I was sent to <LOC>Ventnor<\LOC>. Did you find that studying it at <LOC>Southfields<\LOC> in <LOC>Morse<\LOC> very No. No, it was ever so easy. What was <LOC>Ventnor<\LOC> Oh, lovely. Lovely place. I loved it at <LOC>Ventnor<\LOC>. When did you go there? Was it pre D-Day?    I was there twice and I was twice at <ORG>Abbot<\ORG>'s Cliff. It was over D-Day, during D-Day, but I went there about in '43. I think it was something like September '43. I had just passed as a WT operator and that made me into a chief petty officer or chief <PER>Wren<\PER> as they called it. Which I think is a bit misleading, it sounds as if you were leading the whole of the <PER>Wren<\PER>s, if you have a title like chief Wren, and because I think she was referred ... . I've forgotten her name now. I think she was called the chief <PER>Wren<\PER>. Anyway, I went there and I loved it because it's beautiful. It's very pretty around <LOC>Ventnor<\LOC>. Also, I could get home for forty-eight hours easily, or even thirty-six. Across the island, and that was Solent, and the family then were living in <LOC>Totton<\LOC> because we couldn't live in our own house in <LOC>South<\LOC> <LOC>Hampton<\LOC>. I just felt more at ease there and I think I went back to <PER>Abbot<\PER>'s Cliff at some stage, but later on. I'm trying to remember when it was. I was certainly, at D-Day, I was certainly at <LOC>Ventnor<\LOC> and it was a wonderful place to be because <LOC>Ventnor<\LOC>'s nearly at the southern point of the Isle of <PER>Wight<\PER>. It was glorious morning and somebody came and shook me up and said it's today, it's today. They're going. When you went and looked, because we were four hundred feet up there, very, very high; you could see a stream of ... They were landing crafts in rows, going out each side, and because it was a glorious day with blue skies, blue sea, bright sunlight, they all looked white. I remember them as white, but they must have been gray. I think they were pale gray or something, landing craft, and it was a magnificent sight. It also gave you a rather creepy feeling. I had danced with a sergeant the Saturday before and you couldn't help wondering how long he survived. . Of course, I didn't know, we'd hadn't met before, we just danced, but it did make you think, you know? How long were you there afterwards? Did you see the hospital ships coming back? No, no, I wasn't there for that. At some stage I was transferred back to <PER>Abbot<\PER>'s <PER>Cliff<\PER> and that was when the V-1s were coming over, the flying bombs. At that stage they'd moved the watch room from an upper floor to a ground floor because we had anti-aircraft guns of every description you can think of in all the fields right beside us, and extending in various directions to try and bring the buzzbombs down before they reached <LOC>London<\LOC>. . For that reason we had a blast wall; we were on the ground floor with a blast wall all the way round, and when you heard them sort of cut out, we had earphones on as you have, and we'd just dive under the bench, you know, in the hope that it wasn't going to land on us. Of course, they did bring them down quite near sometimes, and one poor gun crew were completely wiped out because it landed on them. You would hear them cut out, you know? The engine you would hear coming towards you and I can't remember whether it was before then or after then that I was in <LOC>Ventnor<\LOC>, and I was sleeping after a duty, and I could hear this buzzbomb coming nearer and nearer, and then it lit up my bedroom with its tail, so it was so close. I thought well, this is me. . I'm just going to die now, and no it didn't because it went ... It came very close, went into the hillside behind us and because the hill had hummocks the blast was deflected away from us and we had very little damage, but it was enough. Funnily enough, you're just resigned. You think, you know, you're going to go, you're going to go. They were supposed to go to <LOC>London<\LOC>, weren't they, but I know the POW's that made them deliberately altered the fuses so they'd overshoot or come down ahead of. An awful lot of them never made <LOC>London<\LOC> or went past <LOC>London<\LOC>. Did they? Yes, and I think they sometimes aimed at different places possibly as well, because ... I don't know how, whether <ORG>Southampton<\ORG> ... I think we thought it was going for <LOC>Southampton<\LOC>, you see, because we didn't have many buzzbombs in that area, but your reason is a very good one. Yes. After D-Day, you went back to Dover? This is when it was you [crosstalk That was when we had all the buzzbombs coming over. Yeah, what about the V-2s? Did you ever see the V-2's Well, we met those in <LOC>London<\LOC> because when our job ... As the armies moved along the coast towards <LOC>Germany<\LOC>, there was no point in having <LOC>Ventnor<\LOC> open, for instance, because we'd taken that part of <LOC>France<\LOC>. Gradually, we were drawn back to <LOC>London<\LOC>. To occupy us, they had us helping to translate captured documents using enormous technical dictionaries and doing the preliminary translations. Then it was handed to naval officers, English and Dutch, who had a much better knowledge, and also maybe engineering knowledge, which we didn't have. I was very amused to find out that there was a word called a stuffing box, so I know the German for stuffing box, and injection jets, but stuffing box was very amusing. We did, as I said, the preliminary and while we were there we lived in a block of flats in <LOC>Chain<\LOC> <LOC>Walk<\LOC>. . <PER>Mary<\PER> and I shared a room right at the top, and every so often you'd hear this enormous crab-bang and it would be a V-1 landing somewhere or other, but, I mean, you had to take it. It was philosophically. It didn't really worry us. You just accepted it. 01:34:4  Where were you working when you came to live there? I think it was either in admiralty or in some other place which they'd taken over, because we'd translated part of the schnorchel, which is this device the Germans had and we didn't. Our <ORG>Navy<\ORG> was particularly interested in getting it translated. . It was the device by which they could remain slightly underwater and therefore difficult to see from aircraft and so on, and of ships of course, and they could exchange the foul air in the submarine for ... I'm talking about submarines, sorry ... For fresh air, without actually surfacing. They called it the schnorchel because it was like our word snort. The snorter, really. You can't remember where that you were doing that though? Well, I can't remember the actual building. No. No. It wouldn't have been far. We would have walked there, I think. What about VE Day?    I can't remember that at all. I think we were sent on leave. Those of us who volunteered to go to <LOC>Germany<\LOC> after the war for until our time for being discharged came, were sent home on leave prior to the Lords of the Admiralty, who looked after us very well, deciding it was fit for Wrens to go to <LOC>Germany<\LOC> because, I mean, it was in a pretty awful state immediately after the war. . Even when we got there it was in an awful state, so we went out in November '45 and we're put into a naval barracks which had been taken over from the German panzers. <PER>Mary<\PER> and I shared a room which had two huge wardrobes in and a space for our swords, because presumably it was for I suppose their dress uniform of the panzer army. The panzer who were the tank regiment, so to speak, or the tank core. We were only in the barracks for about, magnificent barracks they had, for about a fortnight. Then we were taken by taxi or limousine to our jobs. Then we were housed, as we were all ... We were a group of eight, POs and CPOs, and accommodated in a very nice block of flats in the center of <LOC>Hamburg<\LOC>. We were allocated to the <ORG>Army<\ORG>, lent to the <ORG>Army<\ORG>, because the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> had plenty of German speakers, more than they needed and the <ORG>Army<\ORG> needed a lot of German speakers. I was attached to an <ORG>Army<\ORG> group who were denazifying the employees of the headquarters and district of the German post office in the <LOC>Hamburg<\LOC> district. We were supposed to be assistant interpreters, but I really wasn't good enough for that as I discovered the first time they tried to make me interpret. The new head, they were getting rid of all the Nazi's, so the head had already been changed for a non-Nazi. Nice man. We were standing out in the street and I was standing with this captain I worked for, <ORG>Army<\ORG> captain, and he was explaining to the German how we were going to peel away the layers of <ORG>Nazi<\ORG>'s as one peeled an onion. I thought, my goodness, what on earth is an onion, how am I going to do that? Fortunately, the German knew a lot of English and he stepped into the breech and rescued me, which was very nice. They didn't use me as an interpreter after that. I had jobs like checking inventories when they took over houses. Going through the inventory and translating it into English. Also, going through questionnaires. All the employees of <LOC>Hamburg<\LOC> district had to fill in a questionnaire giving their status in the Nazi party. If they were scharfuhrer, which was roughly sergeant level, they were out. Although you may think, yes well they're not going to be honest are they, but if somebody who is a scharfuhrer has been booted out, he's going to denounce the ones that stay in. That's how it worked, sort of, if somebody didn't get booted out. . The questionnaires worked quite well apparently, and then they were replaced by non-Nazis. Well, <LOC>Hamburg<\LOC> was devastated wasn't It was devastated, but there were still buildings. Especially the docks area was really devastated. That was piles of rubble and you would see one room halfway up a block of flats with a bit of smoke coming out of it meaning, somebody was living there, because this was six months after the end of the war. It wasn't damage. They would live in whatever they could live in. Did you see many dead bodies there? No, but you could smell them sometimes. You know, you would walk past piles of rubble and this sweet-sickly smell would come out. Also, you saw Germans, I could see from the window where we had ... No it wasn't the meal, it can't have been meals, it must have been our flat. We lived in the flat. We had eight of us in one flat, the group that went over, we all lived together. Although we worked in different places. You could see Germans going through our dustbins looking for food. . They looked grey. Everything was grey, I remember, because the weather was grey. <LOC>Hamburg<\LOC> gets some of the damp that comes up from the <LOC>Atlantic<\LOC> and the <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Sea<\LOC> and they also get the cold from <LOC>Germany<\LOC>, so it's not a very nice climate. Do you remember how you felt when you went to <LOC>Hamburg<\LOC>, or what you Well, I didn't feel terribly sympathetic because they'd bombed us with a very poorly aimed thing. I mean, you can't aim dropping a mine on the end of a parachute in a residential area of the north of <LOC>South<\LOC> <LOC>Hampton<\LOC>. We were about three miles from the port. . They bombed terribly badly, what's the cathedral town in the middle of <LOC>England<\LOC> they bombed? Coventry. That was the first one they did, yes. We hadn't done anything like that, at that time. It was way on in the war that we, you know, we had more power and we could bomb more effectively than they could, but they would've bombed us I'm sure, equally effectively if they had been able to. By then, you were just resigned to seeing devastation pretty much, you know, wherever you Yes, yes. . It was devastating, but in the middle of <LOC>Hamburg<\LOC>, although it was terribly, badly damaged, there were a number of buildings, for instance the NCOs club was the [German ] that's underneath the guild hall so to speak, and it was beautiful. Very nice. We used to go there with some of the other lads that we discovered did our job. We became friendly with them, and we'd go there occasionally, and we'd sing German songs because we all knew lots of beautiful ... I mean, German folk songs are very musical, and pleasant, and we'd sing these. We all knew one which, in my innocence, and the other girl's innocence, we didn't know the full meaning. . We knew the meaning of the words but there was a secondary meaning that we didn't get, you see. We innocently sang this song with the lads, you see, and then we saw German faces peering at us sooner the waiters and waitresses; fancy them singing that song. We found out afterwards. Do you remember the lyrics? I can tell you the words. . [German . Do you know it? No, I don't. It says let me in through your little window, and then it says, you Oh. How do you reflect on your service as a <PER>Wren<\PER> now?     If you meet any <PER>Wren<\PER> almost, nowadays, they all enjoyed it. They all look back to it as a period they wouldn't have wanted to miss. Even though, as I say, we didn't really have a social time and we had very little to do with the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> because of the circumstances. We did have a good time when we went to <LOC>Germany<\LOC>. That was terrific because there weren't many English girls over there, so we did have a wonderful time over there. . No, we enjoyed it and I always felt, as I think I told one of you on the telephone, that our Lords of the Admiralty were really kind old uncles who looked after the Wrens, because I'll tell you one story that's quite interesting. When we went to <LOC>Germany<\LOC>, went on our draft, we had to go to <PER>Howell<\PER> and stay in an <ORG>Army<\ORG> transit camp, which was <ORG>Nissen<\ORG> <ORG>Huts<\ORG> in November. The only heating you had in your hut was this iron stove in the middle with a sort of bendy, metal pipe going to the ceiling and my bunk was the far end so I didn't benefit much from that. It was cold and miserable and the ablutions were sort of three or four things, and you went out and washed in concert, so to speak, not a proper bathroom. When they got us up at 4am to go on board and they gave us breakfast of brown stew and plum cake, and when you'd finished what you could eat of the brown stew, you went over to a dustbin already half-full of other people's uneaten brown stews and you wiped it into this horrible mess. We then embarked for a rough <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Sea<\LOC> crossing and the only people in for breakfast the next day was me and an <ORG>Army<\ORG> officer in the far corner of the dining room. . My idea of food and accommodation in the WACS endured must have been a bit grim. You never <PER>Mountbatten<\PER> or anyone like Nobody, no. No, I didn't meet anyone. Any Wrens that stood out? Any famous Wrens? No, we had an interesting collection of people. As I said, we had admirals daughters who were not commissioned because an awful lot of the girls in our job were suitable for commissions but there weren't that number of ... You could only have one officer in charge of, you know, so many of us. I met people who had the honorable this, and lady so-and-so, who had been brought up where they learnt German, you see. . We also had people who'd worked in travel agencies, and traveled abroad, and teachers who'd volunteered. So we were a very mixed ... Oh, and Jewish girls who'd probably come over from <LOC>Germany<\LOC> with their parents in the 30's, early 30's. It was a very interesting group. Very secretive. You didn't talk. No, we didn't talk. No, we can't have because they didn't know about us. If you read about Enigma, for example, you'll find that we absolutely fooled the Germans. They had no idea that we had broken their codes. Not just ... There were more than one code, there was the <PER>Lorenz<\PER> Code and we used to listen, you could hear the Lorenz machine operating, but of course, you couldn't read it because it was automatic anyway. . Very fast and in a different code from Enigma, but they broke that as well, but the Germans didn't realise it. When you say you could hear it ... Well, it was sent by radio, and you could hear it, and it would be a sort of ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding like that, but you couldn't read it. I mean, they could read it, because and I suppose they could hear, they'd worked out ... You had to receive it on a machine. You couldn't receive it; a human being couldn't take it down at that speed, whatever it was. I don't know quite what form it had, but you heard it sometimes. . You could also hear what they called hellschreiber, which was a teleprinter. That was very fast too. You couldn't take that either, but it could be taken by a machine and then rehashed so it was readable and you had to investigate straight signals, of course. End of
 I was born in <LOC>London<\LOC> at <LOC>City<\LOC> <LOC>Road<\LOC> <LOC>Hospital<\LOC> 1926 my mother told me that the snow was up to the windowsills I’d imagine this was on the ground floor. Within a few days I was a poorly baby, I went down with double pneumonia, which was one of the child killers of those years and therefore I was on open order. . Open order meant that every twenty four hours they checked you just to see if you were still alive and any of your relations come in at any time to see myself and my mother of course in the bed by the side of me to see if we’re all right. I was baptised in the hospital chapel and fortunately I managed to overcome that problem. Why did you want to join the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> and what were the circumstances around I think really in those days it’s difficult for people to envisage this now. A war was on and people like myself you wanted to fight back. It’s like a burglar trying to break into your door normally you’ll try and stop him and I was doing a certain amount with the ARP (Air Raid Precautions) and I really wanted to go a little bit further so I thought about it, and I thought I’ll try and get a little bit more involved so I went to the local drill hall where they usually take volunteers for any of the three services and this is one in <LOC>Edgware<\LOC>, <LOC>Deansbrook<\LOC> <LOC>Road<\LOC> and volunteered for the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> I came along to pass all the tests I think there a few weeks later and be they excepted me and said a letter would follow, but they couldn’t take me at the time because I was only seventeen. . They said they would take me at seventeen and a half providing the job I was going to do in the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> took about six months so I would be eighteen by the time I could go aboard a ship. So when I started work on the Monday after that I said to the foreman well I’ve joined the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> and he was going ‘no no you can’t… … we want you here we’re doing more work here you don’t have to join the <ORG>Navy<\ORG>’ I said ‘I’ve made up my mind I’m joining the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> forget it’ and another bit of luck because that firm was working a hundred percent with asbestos and at the time there was no problem, but of course I find out later on nearly everybody in that firm that I knew died of asbestosis so must have been another one of my lucky… lucky times. From there dead on my age of seventeen and a half a letter arrived report to the drill hall where you joined and you’ll be taken on from there to <ORG>HMS<\ORG> <ORG>Royal<\ORG> <ORG>Arthur<\ORG> so dually I turned up there, a little crowd of us and then I a truck I think it was took us to the <LOC>London<\LOC> station and from the <LOC>London<\LOC> station a group of us went up to <LOC>Skegness<\LOC> and there we are at HMS Royal Arthur. There we did all joining routines, get your uniform and be told lots of things about the <ORG>Navy<\ORG>. . Lots of horror stories I’m afraid to do with what’s known nowadays as… I think it was venereal disease in them days which was rife. I went on from there after passing all the usual tests to <LOC>HMS<\LOC> <LOC>Scotia<\LOC> where I went through the exams for a telegraphist in 1944 I went down from there to HMS Royal Arthur again and at that time D-Day was coming up and they had quite enough telegraphists to fit all what they wanted so they said ‘would you like to change over to something else’ I said ‘well if you need something else’ he said ‘yes you can become an Able Seaman and from there… … there are lots of things you can aim for’ so I thought I like that sound of that so although I was a telegraphist because I passed the exams went from there down to HMS Ganges. HMS Ganges was tough you can’t say that hard enough… it was tough after being in somewhere like HMS Scotia which is quite easy. Why was it tough? Well because you had to be an <ORG>Able<\ORG> <ORG>Seaman<\ORG> and an Able Seaman as it turned out was a tough job. The one thing because D-Day was coming up you did training to fight on the land as well as fight on the sea so we were going in for bayonet practice, throwing of hand grenades amongst your ordinary seamanship jobs and D-Day happened while I was still there and we could hear the fighting going on the other side of <LOC>Harwich<\LOC> from the landings. . And we were giving blood as much as we can for the injured and we were told several times that ‘if the fighting gets any worse and it’s horrific now you’ll be over there joining them whether you are fully trained or not’ So fortunately fighting although injuries didn’t get tougher than they were so passed out as an ordinary seaman and after that I was asked if I wanted to do what was called a Suberate. The Suberate you could be an ASDIC Operator, a Gunner, or you could be a Torpedoman. Well as I was already trained as a Telegraphist being a Radar Operator seemed about the next step. So anyway that was another short course on The Isle of Man. Are these all Stone Frigates that you’ve been training They are all stone frigates all the land bases are stone frigates so… so far I’ve never even seen a ship only little whalers and we did learn to sail and do all the knots and everything at HMS Ganges. So in between that when I finished my telegraphist course and they said to me ‘well we’re not sure if we’ve got enough telegraphists’ they said ‘there is lots of options’ so I said ‘can I have the options’ they said ‘yep well one nice job that is coming up nowadays is a signalman on landing craft’ they said ‘well you’ve done all the training you only have to learn to be a signalman with the flags and so forth’ but it came into my head the landing craft with me standing up the front there flag waving and the Germans shooting at the flag waver so I said ‘no I’m no hero I come here to do a job not be a hero’ so anyway so I finished up as a Radar Operator. There was two types of radar operators. There was a <ORG>Radar<\ORG> P??? and Radar Gunnery <ORG>Control<\ORG> well as I carried out gunnery in HMS Ganges on big guns they had six inch heavy guns there that you trained on I operated for the Radar Control <ORG>Gunnery<\ORG> so I did that course and from there I went down to <LOC>Chatham<\LOC>, which was my base anyway I was a <LOC>Chatham<\LOC> Rating and waited there for a ship. . When you’re waiting for a ship all you do is walk about the barracks jobs like painting coal white or sweeping up all different places and you go down every evening in your own time to what I believe is called the big barn and they’ll have lists for people to go on draft for a ship. Well the first one I came across after going down there for several weeks had my name on there was quite a lot on this draft so we had to go for some reason to have a medical… everyone had to pass for a medical that was on that draft what it was for they never tell you… they never tell you in the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> it’s known as the silent service… they never told anything. Anyway I went for this medical examination as it came to my turn to see the medical officer he said ‘out’ I said ‘why’ ‘out’ so I stand out to one side wait for some time and then came across I said ‘what’s wrong I feel alright’ he said ‘you’ve got German measles’ well my goodness ‘German measles and you’re fighting the Germans I haven’t been anywhere near <LOC>Germany<\LOC>’ he said ‘don’t be funny’ I was out. . I spent a few weeks in sickbay I’ve got no memory at all of what happened there, I don’t think anything could of happened, but if you’re going on a draft and you’re going on a ship obviously two hundred men upwards on a ship you could pass it on so… in a few weeks’ time my name was on another draft and this was for HMS <PER>Carron<\PER> and we’re not told we’re just told we’re going on a draft and the number on the draft. So when the time came there was about a hundred and fifty to two hundred of us from <LOC>Chatham<\LOC>. We were put on <ORG>Navy<\ORG> trucks open back, but covered truck taken down to the <LOC>London<\LOC> station I’m not sure which one it was now… but all of us put on one train I don’t think there was any other people on that train. . Every one of the doors were locked, locked in and a young lad by the side of me said ‘you know what that’s for’ I said ‘yeah to stop us from getting out’ ‘no it’s not it’s to stop the girls getting to us when we get to a station’ I started to chat, we got friendly. None of us ever knew each other we come from all over the place, but anyway that was a long trip up to <LOC>Glasgow<\LOC>. We stopped quite a few times I think for air raids and for no reason. I believe we stopped at <LOC>Carlisle<\LOC> and the windows were opened on the carriages lovely cups of tea and sandwiches passed across from the <ORG>WVS<\ORG> or whoever now anyway after a little rest on started the train again. . As we drew out of the station I remember there was a big factory by the side of the station right on the track an old mill or something like that and out of the windows there was balloons, the girls waving the balloons well not some of the balloons I can remember I think they were a little bit of another type, which I won’t mention, but anyway that was nice we loved the fact we were being cheered on our way. We eventually in <LOC>Glasgow<\LOC> and we changed straight away what must have been a local train that train took us to <LOC>Greenock…<\LOC> <LOC>Greenock<\LOC> was our destination and we were then put in to what must have been a <ORG>YMCA<\ORG> a big building and we were then told that we were due to be a ships company of a brand new ship that had been built in the ship yard that was right next door to the <ORG>YMCA<\ORG> really. Now it wasn’t ready we could go and look over the ship anytime we liked a mass of wires and people welding and I can’t really remember what we did we must of walked around <LOC>Greenock<\LOC> anyway in a few weeks the ship was ready all the old wires and bits and pieces had been removed and we were given our places on the forehead mess deck, we were pointed out where we had our locker, where we put any clothes we were in uniform now of course our civilian clothes had gone so we just had our <LOC>Royal<\LOC> <LOC>Naval<\LOC> clothes. The first of the things we had to do was go through the trials. The trials were taken up the Clyde to do the speed… whatever was determined and a few gunnery trials anyway when we finished at the trials and the ship was commissioned then into the <ORG>Royal<\ORG> <ORG>Navy<\ORG> that was the time we was going to be off none of us was told we were going to go on a certain day so if we happened to be having shore leave we couldn’t tell anybody, but then one dark night shortly after we finished our trials we slipped from the dockside of the yard and edged our way up through the Clyde no lights of course, we closed all the water tight doors all the scuttles all the dead lights… and we were given our positions that we were on watch then, we were real sailors then. So I was starboard watch so therefore I would be up on the… … half an hour on the starboard lookout we never had any actual training for this we were just told to do whatever we were told. So anyway we eased out of the Clyde you had to go past the boom which lets out the Clyde and I remember I came off watch or I hadn’t gone on watch I can’t remember this stage, but I had reason to go to the head which are toilets… I was just sitting down and there is an enormous explosion and the doors rattled… I pulled my trousers up quickly… rushed out of the door… … into what they call the canteen flat that’s the passage way and bumped into one of the other sailors who was a little bit more experienced than me… ‘have we been torpedoed on our first night out’ ‘no it’s only the Torpedoman trying the depth charges out’ a bit shame faced ‘I didn’t know that’ he said ‘you were in the right place there anyway’ so we had a good laugh about that anyway from there as I say it was a dark night. Why was it all so clandestine when you This is one of the problems the enemy knew that there was ships being built nearly all the time and they would come out of the Clyde or come out of the Tyne or perhaps come out of <LOC>Ireland<\LOC> and if you can visualise <LOC>Ireland<\LOC> and <LOC>Scotland<\LOC> in narrows…. It’s really wide you know it’s a long distance but it narrows as a continent and therefore ships have to come in and out of that area well this was always the places you’d have two or three U-boats just lurking hoping for a good kill and whether they ever found out that a ship with spies or anything that was coming out at that time I’ve no idea, but that was the most dangerous part because none of us had worked together. . We’d all come out of training we’d had good training in our own jobs, but of course not as a team because we were not with the same people we were training with. So from there onwards as you go up through the Hebrides it was really a few sailors that had experience and the officers of course that were experienced and you had to have all their knowledge to do what you were doing because you would get no escort you’re a ship completely on your own with seventy five percent of the crew never been to sea at all never even seen a ship before very often so if we’d been attacked at that time we would have been a sitting duck. When we arrived at <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> flow, which is relatively safe we go through the boom again to get into the flow and from then onwards we do are training. Well the training at <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> Flow really is to get you working as a team. The whole ship has to know exactly what they’re doing the gun crew of four or five has to know how to work together and if you’re in the transmitting station, which is one of the ???? as we were as gunnery control you’d have about ten people in that room, which is only the size of an ordinary sitting room and each one of those has a job to do because on a destroyer, which we were HMS <PER>Carron<\PER> was a destroyer a brand new one as well so nobody knew anything about it so we had to learn how to use the fire control table as it was when you’ve got eight people on it and all those eight people although they are trained on something similar in their training they still have to know how to fight if the ships attacked or if we’re attacking another ship. So that is what was expected of us in the Flow… By that time we were so short of destroyers in particular and other escort ships so not only are we staying in a nice safe area to do our training we were sent out in harness as it was called with another ship that might be more experienced and then there is one that is experienced and one that is training and that is us so we learnt it the hard way. All our real fighting was around that time. . At the end of 1944 which was October, November, December we was around that area so they would send us out with another ship and this is in one case we was the only ships that were in the Flow destroyers and of course we was duty destroyer and HMS Bullen, which we didn’t know about at that was a ship that got sunk. So we was sent out with no basic training on this. We had a call to go to a ship off <LOC>Cape<\LOC> <LOC>Wrath<\LOC> that had been sunk or been torpedoed they didn’t actually… our message was not that it had been sunk. That a ship had been torpedoed two destroyers had to go out to try and help to catch the UBoat that had sunk it and pick up survivors if there was any there. . So there was two of us and it seemed from one of the records I’ve looked up the other ship that went out with us was another ship that was also working out… so there was two destroyers without absolutely no experience at all had to go out to this ship. I found later in life it was HMS Bullen, which was an escort vessel and they had been looking for a U-Boat. The very U-Boat they had been looking for hit one of our ships first so HMS Bullen had been sunk and the other ships that were with her were still looking for the U-Boat. Well the first thing we did was our skipper was very knowledgeable, very experienced and he went to the position where the U-Boat had sunk HMS Bullen. . Nobody was told anything, he knew it was HMS Bullen none of us were told. So the first thing you do you go around depth charging the whole of the area in case the U-Boat is still there. Well we picked up an echo which told our ASDIC operator that there was something down there, which could be the U-Boat so we depth charged that area and apparently the echo didn’t move it stayed there so we assumed that… that was a U-Boat and it never came up, never got any oil, never got anything. So at that time in the war the snorkel had only just started, which helped them later on in the war. Now if this U-boat didn’t come up within twenty four hours then it was a dead duck. So we waited around there all night with a boarding party ready to go onto the U-Boat because it would have had to come up for fresh air if it had of been… and then it seemed we had to go on another job. I don’t know whether we received the message, but we had to go on an escort job. So we stood down the whole team. we stood… this was the next morning we stood down the boarding party and I was looking over the side of the ship, I had no work to do… I was off watch I could see in the near distance a magnetic mine float past, but nobody shot at it which they might of done usually in case there was a U-Boat down there they would know we was still there. . We was on silent routine all night, you never started your engines because you didn’t want that U-Boat if it was still alive down there to know we was still up there waiting. So in the end we went back to <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> Flow and carried on with our learning to fight a war. Tell me about Christmas in Skapa? Well this I told you about was the 6th of December some more jobs we might of done there I’m not sure, but the next important thing that I can remember is that we are not required for work around the Christmas period so we were back in Scapa Flow and it was quiet and we were safe, but none of us has had a Christmas away from home before this and there we all were in a dead place Scapa Flow… <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> <ORG>Flow<\ORG> is a terrible place dead as anything and what surprised me there is two hundred on a ship roughly two hundred ships complement and luckily we had a few amongst us that were experienced and there we were the cooks in the mess making Christmas cakes with whatever stuff we could get hold of. We also managed to get… … I’m not sure where from a Christmas tree from somewhere and that is run up on top of the mast on top of every ship at Christmas time if they are in harbour they have a Christmas tree run up on top of the ship. And we should have been served I think by the officers being Christmas, but I can’t remember whether we were or not and you’re not allowed to have drink onboard it’s a dry ship, but some of the old ???? saved some of their rum ration, which you’re not allowed to do because there is a very high charge if you're caught, but the officers normally on a small ship like a destroyer close their eyes to lots of things that they wouldn’t be allowed to on a big ship that we call a passer ship. . So many of the lads that were allowed rum, I wasn’t because you’re not allowed rum until you’re twenty and I was only eighteen, but out came the rum ration horrible I hate it and people made up things out of paper some ???? paper red green and blue came from different places out of hidey holes and that was made into decorations and we were moored at a buoy there at the time and we would sing Christmas songs. Some people had instruments so we had a small band onboard and I suppose some of our lads that come from homes that never had it bad I think they were very tearful for them. I came from a home that we didn’t have much money so Christmas wasn’t much different. So anyway we all enjoyed our first Christmas away from home at a lace like <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> <ORG>Flow<\ORG> so that was quiet good. Commander <PER>Wilkinson<\PER> was our captain and everybody would have given their life for him really after we’d been with him for a time… although it was very strict… he was a lad the same as us later on in the story when we go to the Far East I’ll tell you a little bit more about it. . We had water polo teams and he was on the team with the lads against the officers and that was the type of person he would be and I think he was boxing champion of the fleet or part of the fleet and yeah he was such a nice person you know and there is another case that I will tell you when I go ashore. But the next thing we went on really after Christmas was when we really started learning that there was a war on. We would still go out as a ship working up together, but the first one we went out with I believe two aircraft carriers and this was to be a strike against <LOC>Norway<\LOC>. . We didn’t know until we were out at sea that we were doing this, but there was these two aircraft carriers some more destroyers I think and some other ships now are job was not only to protect one of the carriers, but it was also to act as a life boat really when the aircraft took off and I think a couple of these were old type aircraft, I can’t remember the name of them, but they were bi-planes. Now this was a really rough day and they took off… and I watched them I was on watch all the time and I watched them from the deck and the carrier was bouncing up and down and they took off and I think they carried out or tried to carry out their task, but the two I saw come back didn’t make it because the ship was dancing up and down the aircraft carrier dancing up and down and I believe one of them hit the deck and was pushed overboard, that’s with the people in it… they can’t take them out pushed them overboard to make room for another one landing and the other one disappeared I think he was given orders to try and fly back to his base or a base because it was too rough to land on the aircraft carrier… we were crash boat I think it was called we went to try and find the aircraft that had ditched… sadly no aircraft so anyway I think they had to call off the strike because it was just too dangerous to do anymore flying or anything like that… … so that was really a bad beginning to my war… then we went back to <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> Flow. When you talk about it being rough how were your see Terrible I was sea sick most times when I went to sea, but when you are on look out or when you are in the TS which is ??? the TS is down below and that is the transmitting station that takes the… that’s like a relay from the director tower which is right up the top of the ship through you in the TS to the main armament which is four 4inch guns so I was a communication number. The director would speak to me the two officers and the director would be speaking to me and I would be speaking to the guns, but apart from the director would have instruments that would send signals down to our big computer the original mechanical computer would send that information mechanically to the guns, but once I got into a position where there was excitement I forgot all about sea sickness… … I was okay so that was a good thing, but normally if I wasn’t on watch I’ll be standing on the upper deck watching the sea heaving up and down… probably being sick. The only time you go to action stations is when you’re expecting action later on when we talk about the mine laying we’re at action stations all the time, but if you are doing a job just escorting then you are at cruising stations until some trouble pops up. Depth charging a U-Boat is not a case of going to action stations it’s only if the U-Boat fights back then you go to action stations. So anyway we went from there back to <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> Flow I think we did one or two journeys like this of the Coast of <LOC>Norway<\LOC> and this is the beginning of 1945 and eventually we supposedly finished our training learning working together as a team. Mind you all this time I’m talking about to you now we were still learning because we were still teaming up with people that we never worked with before so if we run into any real trouble at that time we wouldn’t of stood a lot of chance. . It wasn’t until later on when we learnt these things. So the next one I think is an important one this is about February I believe we were just told we were going out that night and we were not given any real information about where we were going and what we were going to do, but it was a very big do. There was a very large force; we left about ten o’clock at night. Is this out of <ORG>Scapa<\ORG>? This is out of <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> this is what turned out to be the mine laying operation although there was no moon it was all-star light so it was very good visibility and it was a very calm night strangely enough hardly any rough sea or anything. We set out and you seldom know who is with you… it’s the silent service and we’d been out about an hour I believe about ten o’clock and the skipper then said over the tannoy what we’re going to do… … he’d opened his orders and he told us that we are a big force one of the large force was going down the southern part of <LOC>Norway<\LOC> to <LOC>Egersund<\LOC> and they were going to attack a convoy. We were one of two ships another one was HMS Zealous was a same destroyer as we were and are main task was that we had to escort this minelayer HMS Apollo. First of all both forces working together had to pass through a big minefield there is a big minefield that was laid I think by us and we had to go through one path through it, which was the only path through it, but we knew where the opening was so it should have been safe enough, but you do get loose mines so our <ORG>ASDIC<\ORG> operator had to pick out the mines and I was on watch at one time and I could hear him saying that there is something on the port side and the captain would move the ship over a bit. So anyway we got through the minefield all of us with no real problem and then we split up. We were to wait until twelve o’clock and at that time at twelve o’clock the other big force we were by the way up near <LOC>Stavanger<\LOC> at that point and the other big force was two cruisers I think, no aircraft carriers at that point and they were going to attack a convoy… a German convoy that was going to leave <LOC>Egersund<\LOC> and was going to hug the coast all the way up to <LOC>Stavanger<\LOC>, but the other force was to stop them getting there. So dead on twelve o’clock the other force that was going to attack the convoy and they were hoping when that started lots of fireworks down along the coast it’s quite a few hundred miles, but that would take the heat off what we were doing… we were a clandestine operation. . We were to escort the Apollo to the point where she was going to start laying mines dead on twelve o’clock and we were to between her and the Norwegian coast and if she was sighted by the Germans or picked up by radar by the Germans and they were to start firing we were to make as much noise as we could and tear up and down between the sea between the Apollo and the Norwegian Coast and use all the guns and flares and everything we could to take the heat of her so they’d attack us. So the Apollo would of either flashed us or indicated to us or not I’m not sure because everybody had to keep radio silence and we were on silent routine… nobody was allowed to smoke or anything. You were not even allowed to bang because the noise… … we were not far away from the coast our two, but the ships both us and the other escort destroyer the Zealous had to keep up as much steam as we could because if the fireworks started we would have to at full speed rush up and down this bit of coast firing whatever we could to prevent them seeing the Apollo. Well I could hear from the guns in the TS and from the director before we started doing anything and I could hear the people on the guns saying ‘I can see the headlights there… there only over there a little bit a car coming down from the right to the left’ I could hear all this and ‘I hope they can’t see us where they are’ and then he said ‘right they’ve started down the other end’ and they started firing down at the other end they attacked this convoy and they would have been… You couldn’t see that though? We couldn’t… I couldn’t see anything anyway because I was down in the TS so I was getting all the messages not from the two officers in the director tower, but from my mates on A gun, B gun, X gun and Y gun they were funneling all the information to me ‘saying I think that blokes smoking over there… hope they can’t see us’ apparently they didn’t we didn’t have to do much. So we were slowly moving up and down and the Apollo started laying her mines dead on time… … dead on twelve o’clock The minelayer… it’s a big minelayer they carried a lot of mines a big cruiser they are and once they start laying the mine that’s where we would have had to come in they can’t stop they’ve got to do the whole of their mine laying because the mine field is being laid so they can’t turn back, they can only go on and carry on laying their mines. . So anyway we’re just going slowly up and down and because our ship was keeping steam up ready for a quick dash up and down the valve blew so you’ve got a normal what is a well-known destroyer hoot woop woop, which we do every time we come in and out of harbour just to signal. And apparently everybody went mad the cruisers went mad, we were in silent routine you know and the fact that we were never sussed out not until the very end and I think it might even be if anybody had heard that woop, which is a well-known British destroyer signal to say I’m coming in to the harbour or somewhere if they thought you know it can’t be a British destroyer nobodies daft enough to do a thing like that you know. So anyway they laid the mines and then we knew I don’t know by signal or what just said ‘all done we carried out our mission see you back in port’ and I was at that time listening to some of the… and they were saying ‘look at her move’ and she was doing forty knots, she was one of the fastest ships there were and they could see the bow wave… it’s night but it was star light and you could see… you could see the shore, you could see the place where the guns were, they would have had a crack at us if they’d known and away went the Apollo at speed and we turned around, we went as fast as we could, but we were not allowed to go at a good speed because we got a signal that the Germans had sussed out that they were being attacked from <LOC>Egersund<\LOC> with the battle we had going on down there and some friends of mine afterwards on the Apollo I kept in touch with them. . They said they understood and they were in the wireless room… telegraphist office they had understood that we had been challenged the force had been challenged because they had picked us up on radar. The force had been challenged and he thinks that the Apollo that was in charge of course had given the right challenge answer, but then they challenged again later on and didn’t the Apollo started disappearing so they sent torpedo bombers after us and they never found us so we got back okay. So the mine laying was successful our force further down at <LOC>Egersund<\LOC> had stopped the convoy going up to… … the German convoy had sunk one or two of the ships and one or two of are ships had injured people, but this whole mission was successful. It sounds to me like you were expendable when you were out there with the Apollo? You are… I would of though a destroyer was valuable bits of kit… … tell me a bit about the role of a destroyer and it’s comparable? What I shall bring in is because later on towards the end of the war which won’t be in that one is when we were a big force escorting some of the cruisers out to the <LOC>Far<\LOC> <LOC>East<\LOC> we only took them as far as <LOC>Gibraltar<\LOC> you see and then another force takes over, but we were escorting a battleship the Renown and we were the close escort on the destroyer each side fairly close when others were further out and it was a beautiful day like this and I wasn’t on watch I was just leaning over the side, but we were quite close because we were close escort you see and I’m just leaning over the side and over the tannoy comes the voice from the captain ‘we’re now reaching a dangerous area and there might be U-Boats around if a U-Boat has fired a torpedo and we see the track of that torpedo heading towards big sister’ which they called the Renown ‘then we stop it, you know what we mean… … we stop it’ and there’s me looking over the side looking and there is a torpedo bulge on the Renown and thinking to myself yes we’re going to lose two hundred men just to stop a torpedo bending a torpedo bulge you know… Just tell me a bit about the role of a destroyer? Well the role of most destroyers is they’re fast and they are maneuverable and they’re like a smaller version of a cruisers they have all the gunnery, but smaller guns so they’ve got four big guns 4.5 big guns and other small guns got all those. The one thing they’ve got extra apart from the smaller size scaled down. The big ships have not got anti-submarine equipment they’ve got torpedoes and things unless the submarines on the surface they’ve got no depth charges. . So a destroyer had depth charges so we are there too… But on the other hand the difference the reason why you’ve got a destroyer is just as I said if the capital ship or whatever it is we are guarding is torpedoed the last resort is you get in the way of the torpedo they’d rather lose a ship that’s only got two hundred men onboard than a possibility of losing more than two hundred men on a battleship remote as it might be that it’s got a torpedo bulge and this is why we we’re short of destroyers because so many of them get lost because the first thing you do when a torpedo is sighted is go to attack the submarine that fired it, but you should be near enough to get in the way of the torpedo if it happens to be heading you way. You know you talked a bit about how you weren’t a team you were a young crew is there a moment when you were onboard where you thought we’re working brilliantly Well not really you just sort of fit in part of life is you manage to fit into every situation luckily enough I never worried you think because you are a good swimmer you must be alright if the ship sinks, but then when you think about it and you speak to other people you’ve got sea boots on at the time, you have a belt which should save you, which you wear all the time at sea, but you can’t wear that belt blown up because it gets in the way of the arms and everything so what happens is if you have to jump into the ogin as they call it… the sea that belt mustn’t be blown up because you might break your arms so you’re expected to blow that up when you hit the sea and I can’t see… … luckily I never had too, but I know survivors that have told me ‘I had to blow it up as soon as I hit the water, but I had no breath at all left so I couldn’t blow it up’. But the sea boots drag you down because this is what you’re wearing it’s just one of those things. What’s the next big event that you recall It was really mundane most of the things as escort to the monsters we did your enemy in most cases was the sea we got battered left right and centre trying to keep up with the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> and <PER>Queen<\PER> <PER>Elizabeth<\PER> because as we took them out of the Clyde we zig zagged all the way with them and we kept up with them until they reached top speed, which was for the distance all the way across then we left them or we either waited around for the next one coming in. . for instance we might of taken the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> out and we might have had to wait just a few hours for the Queen <PER>Elizabeth<\PER> to come in. And all the time one of you might pick up one of the three of you… the <ORG>Queen<\ORG> <ORG>Mary<\ORG> would have its own <ORG>ASDIC<\ORG> besides its own radar and we of course had the ASDIC and radar and our cohort perhaps the Cavalier would be the same. . Well when we’d steam out we would probably be apart at the extremes of your ASDIC circle and you radar circle so you didn’t interfere with each other’s receipt of the wave and if we picked up an echo, which might have been a submarine, might have been a wreck well immediately we’d run up a black flag on our flag deck so the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> would know and also the Cavalier would know that we’ve picked up an echo. Immediately we’d hive off to attack that echo and this is where you are in trouble if it is because a U-Boat might of already fired its torpedo and this is where you turn off swiftly at full speed if you can, if you’ve got a beam sea which means you can’t turn off left or right you hit the beam sea a destroyer you’ve got hardly any draft you’ll turn over straight away so you have to be very careful… … we never did whether it was luck or judgment I don’t know anyway then if you haven’t been hit by a torpedo then you’d find your wave to wherever that echo was and you would attack the echo you’d loose of about two depth charges from one side two from the other and roll off from the two racks from the rear a pattern of about ten charges. Well if the U-Boat is a very experienced one and he was watching you on the periscope he wouldn’t be there when you arrived he’d of either gone down low or he would of disappeared in another direction, but at least you’ve kept him down no chance of hitting your charge… and then we’d have to try and catch it up it takes about half a day because they’re keeping the same speed. If the two destroyers had to leave the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> or the <PER>Queen<\PER> <PER>Elizabeth…<\PER> the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> would carry on, it wouldn’t stop and one of the worst things that could of happened if they’d actually torpedoed the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> then they would of lost a lot of lives because if the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> was coming back in it would have a full complement of American GI’s and that would be between ten thousand and fifteen thousand it would be carrying now they would not be able to tighten up their water tight doors because they’re going from the different decks all the time in the twenty four hours. If we go into action stations then we close our water tight doors, which means if you’re torpedoed on one side it will only damage the compartment within so most likely the ship wont sink, but if it’s on the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> then they’ve got no chance of any of their water tight doors because they’re travelling between the different decks. They’re perhaps sleeping on one deck travelling up the next deck to eat food another deck for exercise… … the top deck is always exercise so they couldn’t close their water tight doors so any of those would have been one of the biggest disasters you’d find. What was it like seeing the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> and the Queen <PER>Elizabeth<\PER> sailing with you… … did you have any pride was they ships that you knew of and were proud of anyway? Well all we really knew was going to pick up one of the monsters or bring one of the monsters in. if it was the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> and we were in <LOC>Greenock<\LOC> then we would of known it was the Queen we were taken out and that’s always got three funnels anyway if we picked it up… if it’s got three funnels it’s the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER>, if it’s got two funnels it’s the Queen <PER>Elizabeth<\PER> and so on you’ve got four funnels with the <LOC>Aquitania<\LOC> and so it went on. . You were never told you would just sail out and go to a rendezvous where you would wait around or you’ve already contacted that ship to say you were there and you’d bring it in. Very often even we two escorts one would be at <LOC>Greenock<\LOC> at the Clyde and the other would be down at <LOC>Liverpool<\LOC> and we would meet a point of rendezvous going out of the Clyde and the other one Cavalier perhaps come out of <LOC>Liverpool<\LOC> and then we would steam up together to the rendezvous point for the monster. . This happened once or twice a week for one of us we never had the same cohort because they wouldn’t always be in the same area, they’d be doing something else and between that if you’re duty ship if there was an aircraft carrier which happened in one case had been torpedoed we’d just come down from <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> to <LOC>Greenock<\LOC> and we’d just arrived at the harbour entrance we went straight to an oiler because you always have to fill up with oil because you might have to go out And just as we were at the oiler we got an emergency call to say that an aircraft carrier had been torpedoed just out in the <PER>Clyde<\PER> at the beginning of the Clyde so we just let go from the oiler and straight out to the ???? an aircraft carrier and strangely enough she was on her own she come from <LOC>Londonderry<\LOC>, she’d had no escort and luckily she didn’t have a full complement of seaman and so forth and she was coming to the Clyde. I don’t know why, but they torpedoed that. . They torpedoed a merchant ship at the same time and the U-Boat got away so we went to attack it. It was dark and we left the others I think looking for the U-Boat afterwards when we came back into harbour. How long are you at sea when you are out in the <LOC>Atlantic<\LOC> and how often are you going back to base and getting your land In a destroyer not very long because you haven’t got that much fuel and you’re always using your top speed always maneuvering. The only way of getting fuel if you are out for a long time is from one of the bigger ships wither from an aircraft carrier or if it’s as big as the <LOC>Belfast<\LOC> or a cruiser or something like that and also food. Your food runs out after a short while so the only time we were really out for a long time is when we were up at <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> when we was working up… … when we was going out on forays to help sink the Tirpitz or doing other jobs. Most of the others it was a case of going out just for a day or two just picking up one of the monsters and then come back with a monster or take one out and leave it, it which case we would have to go to <LOC>Londonderry<\LOC> perhaps and then we come out of <LOC>Londonderry<\LOC> again you know and go out on that so we were lucky on that respect that we were not out for very long. There is only we was out for a very long time it must have been over five days I can’t remember what the occasion was, but we had run out of food and we was further up in the <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Atlantic<\LOC> and our captain was an ex fishery fleet man… he had his own fishery fleet… … so what he decided to do as we run out of food he said I know where the fish are so he guided the ship up too where he knew they were, picked up a shoal on the radar, on the ASDIC, dropped a depth charge, lowered a boat, picked up all the fish that came up stunned he stood on the <ORG>Foc<\ORG>’sle… we saw him stood on the Foc’sle and said ‘that one mine’ picked the biggest one and we lived on fish a few more days after that. But our runs were mostly just about five days at a time, but that meant every time we came into either Scapa or if we were in <LOC>Liverpool<\LOC> or to the Clyde we had to always have plenty of fuel onboard because if you’re duty destroyer and then something comes up where a ship has been sunk you’d have to go out straight away and you might be out for a long time looking for a submarine or more than a submarine so we were lucky in that fact that we never went out for a long time otherwise it would have been oiling at sea which is a dangerous practice anyway and picking up food and everything from it. Can you just describe radar… … this is the job you were doing yes? Radar yes… well first of all when I was on a radar set it’s only a small set and there are different types the 293 that is high up on the mast specially for picking up aircraft or surface ships really any distant I can’t think of the range of it, but it sends out a signal from there, which of course if it doesn’t hit anything you don’t get it back, but if it hits anything even cliffs or an aircraft or a surface ship then it bounces back and on the screen which is a round screen and the curser is going around all the time that will show a blip and that blip you have to be able to determine whether it’s a cloud, which it might be depending on your radar if it’s doing vertical or angler and then you’d read off the distance angel and everything. . This is mostly on a level, but you have another screen that gives you the height of an aircraft… so you use one with the other. When that electronic signal hits anything then it returns and then you read of the distance of it. Is it easy to It’s easier to use where you find the difficulty is by experience very often you know what you are looking at either the land because of the size of it on there if it’s a small blip its and aircraft a ship whatever, if you know you are using one type of radar it’s only horizontal if you’re using the other one it could be horizontal or an aircraft and it would give you a good distance the time it takes of course it’s based on if it takes ten seconds from there to there its… … and you read it off the screen. Luckily at our point in the war we never had any trouble with aircraft only times we had problems with that is if the torpedo bombers had been sent after us of <LOC>Norway<\LOC> then we would have had to use are… then we would know… we’d have to use the two radar sets then the one that gives you the signal with the height of the aircraft and the other one that gives the distance of it. Then you are trained to know which is the distance. and I also believe as far as I remember if it was one of our own aircraft it would have an identification signal, which you would know on your radar set before it got to you so you’d have to be pretty well experienced, but my time was not always on a radar set you were sometimes on lookout as a seaman where you are sitting up in a lookout box and starboard side was mine and you are looking out for aircraft which was not very often, surface ships or more than likely you’re looking out for a little tiny periscope, which is very hard to see in the rough <LOC>Atlantic<\LOC> or you might be unlucky enough to see the track of a torpedo coming towards you in which case you get into a panic and call out quickly to the people on the bridge. What is said The people on the bridge the captain or the officer on watch at the time in those days it was an open bridge nowadays it’s enclosed, but it was an open bridge so the bridge is here and you’ve got a look out position just here so you just call out to that person on the bridge, duty officer ‘chip bearing red 5 0 green 5 0 whatever your position is, angle of site if it was an aircraft and he can immediately look at it and decide what action to take, but if you’re on that look out position which I was on quite a lot as a seaman it’s rough because as the ship goes down all the time being a destroyer you’re almost a submarine at times the whole of the sea comes up over you and you get knocked back against the search light and its very damp that is very rough… uncomfortable but this is what you get used to. You used to wear a special suit which covered you completely, a water proof suit with kapok lining, but even that the water got all the way day and you got soaking wet. I remember coming off watch on one occasion like this because normally you have to climb down the outside ladders of the ship because the doors you would go in and out in port are open when you are at sea the doors will be closed because the water comes in those so you have to climb down ladders down the outside of the ship. Not outside in the sea but climb down from the top deck to the lower deck and if you’re not carful the wave when it hits you can get washed away so you hold on very tight. Well this was the middle watch I recall which is from twelve o’clock at night to four o’clock in the morning, but you’re not on watch lookout all that time on the four hour watch you do different jobs, half hour on lookout, half hour perhaps on a radar set, half hour behind A-gun where you become part of the gun crew so if you did have to go into action you would do the shooting while the real gun crew is called up to take over from you. Well on this occasion it had been very wet outside I’d got soaking and tired and say middle of watch say about one o’clock I’d come down so I went down to my mess deck which is in the <ORG>Foc<\ORG>’sle a rough part of the ship, I hadn’t slung y hammock I’d slept on the cushions, this time I didn’t fancy sleeping on the cushions because the ship was going so much this way… … I knew I’d come off the cushions so I got down under the mess table, there’s about that much water on the floor on the deck about that much I got all my clothes on a zoot suit they called it if anything and I’m laying down there off to sleep straight away next thing I know a foot had touched me and I opened my bleary eyes and there is the officer of the watch and the leading seaman of the mess And he was saying to me and I’m told this in the morning by the leading hand in the mess he said ‘come on seaman you can’t sleep under there it is too wet’ I said… looked at the leading hand and said ‘what did he say?’ and the leading seaman said ‘I don’t know I don’t read that language’ and so we better let him sleep there and they left me there nothing was said about it so. water? You’re lying in about that much water on the decks of the ship inside… you know inside your mess deck the water just… … its one temperature outside and a little bit warmer inside so all the humidity all the water runs down the inside of the decks anytime you’re on the Caviler you have a look on the inside because the metal work on the ships side is only about an eighth of an inch no thicker than that and so you’ve got water all the time on the mess decks when you’re at sea and when you’re in harbour you’re not to bad. So it gets a bit uncomfortable. There was another time when we worked with the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> and we had to pick her up to bring her in. we went out and it was in about one of the roughest storms there was about three really rough storms in the period we was working in the <LOC>Atlantic<\LOC> and we had to about this time… it would be about March 1945 we had to go and pick up the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> now the storm had been raging all the way from <LOC>America<\LOC> and it must have been a big storm that ad come across our way and the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> had brought it with her sort of thing and we picked her up. . I think we were a day or more waiting to pick her up because even she had been held up by the storm well we and I don’t know what was the sister ship at that time, but we got really bent up, we lost a motorboat, we lost one of the whalers and we got really knocked about and when we got towards the Clyde… knowing that it was in the area where there would be U-Boats we had to really on our speed… And so as we got within hailing distance of the Clyde the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> decided she could not slow down to keep up with us because it was tough rough for us we might have been turned over and so she just flashed a message see you in the Clyde ta ta and she kept up her speed and got into the <PER>Clyde<\PER> now she had the whole of the front of her bridge stoved in, it was a big ship well up in the air, they had a lot of casualties because they are carrying abut twelve thousand troops and this was now late at night I think about eleven o’clock twelve o’clock at night, but anyway she got into the Clyde without any serious damage from the sea… … we limped in later on now in the Clyde you’re not allowed to anchor and we couldn’t go further into <LOC>Greenock<\LOC> because after that you go through the boom and the boom is closed at night unless it is absolutely necessary to open the boom, which prevents or helps to prevent any U-Boats getting in at that point. So at the other side where we had to tie up to a buoy we have two buoy jumpers to tie up to a boy when the ship tops and you have to lower your whaler with the buoy jumper and the rower in it to take you to the buoy with a chain to clip it to the buoy well if I’ve given you a picture of how rough the storm was it was almost impossible really… we let down onto the water managed to get down safely that got washed away with the crew in it further down the <PER>Clyde<\PER> that was a way three or four hours. . We managed to lower another whaler. All of us were up on the foc’sle all the seaman that could help was up on the foc’sle because you can’t use your anchor, you’re just using your anchor chain, which goes with a wire attached to the end of the anchor chain and the whaler has to take this wire to the buoy to clamp it onto the buoy and the buoys pulled by the anchor chain nearer to the ship so they then clip it on. So anyway we lowered the second whaler the buoy jumper managed to get onto the buoy and in doing so broke his wrist and in the end after I think about four hours we managed to clip up to the buoy and the captain said ‘tots all round’ I hated the smell of rum anyway and never would have my tot because it’s horrible, but I had it that night because we were frozen… frozen stiff we managed to get away with it nothing is said about this type of thing because although people of the ports new these big ships come in it was not a thing that was talked about because the Germans also knew that they were bringing all these large numbers between ten and fifteen thousand troops it could carry and any of the U-Boat captains that I understand and this is normal knowledge were offered a large sum of money thousands of Deutsche Mark (Reichsmark) and the highest honours to have knocked down any of these monsters, but we never lost one fortunately I’m happy to say, but the Queen <PER>Mary<\PER> was really battered very badly battered how we didn’t get turned over I have no idea… When you are talking about big seas what sort of size are you talking? Well if you’re talking… is it the seas themselves you’re talking about. Well it is genuinely know that some of the waves were sixty foot high now if you’re thinking of sixty foot going up that way you go up to the wave… and you come down to the trough you’ve got a hundred and twenty foot and there is no way you can cut through those waves, the big ships and the small ships you actually go up on that wave and then you feel it and then you come down with a crunch like that and then you go up the next one and all the time you’re corkscrewing you know you’re not still and you get used to this after about the first few months because you’ve got bruises all over the place… … you go through the normal flats they’re called on the destroyer normal corridor on the floor on a destroyer, which is about that wide. When you first go aboard one like that fairly calm when we set out for <ORG>Scapa<\ORG> from <LOC>Greenock<\LOC>, but as you walk along the deck comes up to meet you as it comes up and you hit your feet as you go down on the deck, but before you know it that deck has gone away as the ship goes down and this hits you from the top and then while that is happening because you’re doing this… … this bulkhead hits you next thing you know that bulk head hits you so in time you learn to walk like a sailor and if the ship goes down you go down with it and come up with it you find sailors when you get ashore they walk with a roll that is just that they’re still walking on the ship. So after the end of the war VE-Day you’re not finished? VE-Day itself we were that’s the 9th of May we were bringing in the SS <LOC>Ile<\LOC> <LOC>de<\LOC> <LOC>France<\LOC> and when we got notice that peace had been declared next day we were going into <LOC>Greenock<\LOC> so we actually brought in the last of the one ship convoys before the war ended and we arrived in <LOC>Greenock<\LOC> it was either Wednesday or Sunday half the ships company was allowed leave, which wasn’t me I’m afraid I wasn’t one of the ships company, but they went ashore to <PER>Greenock<\PER> and had a good time. So then we still carried on with some of these convoys after there because there was quite a few U-Boats apparently missing a lot of them one or two of them went to <LOC>Brazil<\LOC> or whatever so there was still a chance if there was a rogue U-Boat around they could of knocked down some of the monsters we were still bringing back in, but we had no problems at all, but to cut a long story short anyway we were then destined to go across to the end of the Japanese war so two by two flotilla went in for refits. We went in for a refit late in May – June because we were going out there anyway, but fortunately when I was on leave to go out there the ship was down at <LOC>Devonport<\LOC> being refitted the war ended. I’ve still got a telegram to say days leave extra… days leave extra. . When we came back to the ship we still had to go out there because we were having to clear up after the war well the whole of our flotilla was out there then we were the last two so as we went out <LOC>Gibraltar<\LOC>, <LOC>Malta<\LOC>, <LOC>Aden<\LOC> and places like that we thought we was in for a lovely summers cruise, but when we got to <LOC>Singapore<\LOC>, no when we got to <LOC>Trincomalee<\LOC> that was a naval base we were based at <LOC>Trincomalee<\LOC> and we were also based at <LOC>Singapore<\LOC>. Well when we got to <LOC>Singapore<\LOC> this was just about a week or two after the war and we were carrying out an exercise with HMS <ORG>Sussex<\ORG> and another ship and the captain… the flotilla leader was on HMS Caesar and ourselves on Cavalier were ordered to go with the <ORG>Sussex<\ORG> to a problem so we immediately went at full speed we were sent to Java we stopped on a couple of troop ships on the way I can’t remember much about that little bit, but we took onboard… … a full deck was covered with Indian troops, armed Indian troops and the Cavalier was the same, the <PER>Caesar<\PER> was also and the <ORG>Sussex<\ORG> anchored outside <LOC>Surabaya<\LOC> because it couldn’t get in, we could hardly get in because there was a sunken Japanese cruiser in there in the way. So the <PER>Caesar<\PER> went in first because she was flotilla leader full of troops and we went in second because we were second and then the Cavalier afterwards as we went in… it was daylight, we had all these troops onboard so if we had any trouble we couldn’t of used our guns because of the troops luckily we didn’t have any trouble from the shore, but as we came into Surabaya I was looking over the side and there was bodies dozens of them in white naval uniforms I think they were probably Dutch, I don’t think they was ours, but we were slowly moving avoiding this wreckage and avoiding the bodies and you got to the stage now when really bodies in the water made no difference to you… you accepted the fact they were bodies dead you know. So anyway we slowly moved in we anchored in the dock there and one by one the cruiser disembarked her troops first and we came in next so the three of us all our troops went ashore. The docks had already been taken over by the <LOC>UK<\LOC> army I think had been brought in ahead and it was the Indonesian Rebels they were fighting they already had killed Brigadier <PER>Mallaby<\PER> the army boss and these troops went ashore and we stayed there ready for a lot of survivors of the Dutch people they were going to be brought across from a camp right on the other side of <LOC>Surabaya<\LOC> and they were going to be brought under escort under another truce… … see Brigadier <PER>Mallaby<\PER> had been killed under another truce. Now this was supposed to be four thousand Dutch people women and children mostly in a camp the other side they were going to be brought across by another truce army trucks guarded by Indian troops they were going to be brought across to us and we were going to have them onboard and we were to take them out to the troopers, which couldn’t get into the harbour well we were told while we were waiting for these people to come across we were to go out into the water because we might be used, which was absolutely necessary as it happened when this convoy of army trucks guarded by Indian troops got as far as <LOC>Surabaya<\LOC> they were found they were stopped even though they had a white flag… … they were stopped by the post office which was full of Indonesian rebels. The Indian rebels had set up trench mortars and machine guns and as soon as the convoy got there they shot the troops that were guarding the convoy and the convoy come to a halt so we were called in to use are 4.5 guns so we had to fire on the town and we took out the post office with the Indonesian troops in it and then the convoy come through, we went back into harbour and we had all the Dutch people on board and we took them out. We didn’t personally have to go ashore. I had to go ashore later on to guard some of the warehouses and so on but we didn’t have to do any fighting the only fighting we had to do was fire the guns… because I was on the upper deck at the time when we were called in to fire and I was called off the upper deck to fire X and Y gun and I said ‘I’m not a gunner’ they said ‘you are today’ they put me on the gun gunnery with another one and we had to fire and we had to fire in the direction of a spotter plane that was sent up by the army… … the army sent up a spotter plane so apparently we took out the post office so our good deed was done for the day. We did have them aboard overnight a lot of these Dutch people we vacated all the forehead mess decks and we had to sleep down aft on the upper decks and different places and the Dutch people women and children until we took them out to the other ships and then we got our place back… I lost a pair of sandals they disappeared. How do you feel when you’re sailing into a harbour and seeing a lot of dead naval people? Well you’re apprehensive to start with, but at the age you are you’re very seldom frightened I suppose your adrenaline comes back later on and you think to yourself well I could have been killed there, but I wasn’t and that’s how you took it. If you thought of all these things at the time you’d be a nervous wreck but you’re eighteen years old, nineteen years old and if anything happens then fortunately you accept it’s not fear. . Sometimes I look back now and think I could have been killed there, but I’m not I’m here so we accept it just as a fact of life. It was exciting… It’s quite a big way to end your naval service really to be involved in a contact like It is nice to be at this stage and know that you have done certain jobs… well we must of killed people by taking out the post office, but you didn’t see them and you know by doing that you helped to save the last of perhaps two or three hundred of four thousand people and I had the same feeling when we were escorting the troopers the fact that we never knew that we’d sunk a submarine a U-Boat because we never stayed long enough all we could do was depth charge a target. . If that target was a U-Boat then we might of sunk it or it might of got away, but our real job was to look after a ship coming in with fifteen thousand troops and as long as we’d saved that I’m happy, but you never know but I just hope we didn’t I just hope there wasn’t a U-Boat there and those people weren’t killed they were only doing the sort of thing we were doing and that was the job. End of
 <PER>Ted<\PER> if you could begin by telling me you full name and a little bit about your life story? Yes well I was born in 1920 and <PER>Edwin<\PER> <PER>Hunt<\PER>, one of four children. My father was a lighterman, that is he worked on the River Thames with tugs and barges and the family had been doing that for some what… 300 years… yes. So I always wanted to work on the river and when I was 15 left school became apprentice and worked a float started off as a boat boy. . I was very very fortunate in that in those days it was quite common and everyday thing for barges to be rowed, you know 50 ton barges rowed by one man anything between 50 ton carrying capacity and 150 had to have one man, one licensed man and another and of course the other was always the apprentice. So I learnt to do that, but I was especially fortunate because the firm I worked for was the last firm to engage in the practice of towing those barges, 150 ton barges, with a rowing boat and I became the boat boy, I would have a man join me and they’d be two men on the barge, which was required by law and we would tow it and you take a stroke and the rope pulls up and it contracts and you’re going backwards, you have muscles on your muscles. So can you tell me <PER>Ted<\PER> when and why you joined Well I was a 5th year apprentice, in my 5th year when the war started so I joined up and I joined The <ORG>Royal<\ORG> <ORG>Engineers<\ORG> as a Sapper <PER>Waterman<\PER>, half a crown a day equivalent to 12 ½ pence these days and I was immediately sent to a field company well went to <LOC>Chatham<\LOC>, <ORG>Kitchener<\ORG> <ORG>Barracks<\ORG> <ORG>Chatham<\ORG> then to the 229 <ORG>Field<\ORG> <ORG>Company<\ORG> who were a territorial unit in the 49th West riding Division, hence the white roses. Because battledress was in short supply and it was a territorial unit the quartermaster had service dress, brass buttons, chin cutter hats (peak cap with leather chin strap) And at the top of each sleeve was a white rose. . So I had one of these for some 3 months and eventually before going overseas was issued with proper battledress and when I had to hand my service dress in much regret, I looked very very smart, I removed the white roses and I gave one away to another sapper who was also in the 49th Division and had a cloth one he envied these so I didn’t mind giving up one. What was your training Well we did the normal basic training. It was as I remember it in those days ‘manual of field engineering volume two’ it was the bible, it was a green thing and it was blocks and tackles and use of spars and all kinds of things because for me we were up in <LOC>Yorkshire<\LOC> at a place just outside <LOC>Ripon<\LOC>, <PER>Cophewick<\PER> and we came down to <LOC>Wallingford<\LOC> for a fortnights pontoon training, just upstream from <LOC>Wallingford<\LOC> <LOC>Bridge<\LOC>. Now the territorial unit people they’d been to <PER>Scarborough<\PER> and done their summer camp, but they weren’t really expert oarsman and rowing on a pontoon with your legs out straight is rather difficult, you feel it behind the knees and the river had been in flood and had flooded the flood plain, the grass on either side and just dropped sufficiently to come back to its normal summer banks and so it was at its fastest. . Someone who rowed for a college eight up there has since told me that it was about 4 knots, that’s pretty fast. And so our pontoon rafts had to be built, constructed up stream and by the time they rowed across they’d travelled quite a bit downstream to the bridging side and the difficulties came when we had to dismantle the bridge and someone eventually found out that there was a waterman in the company sapper <PER>Hunt<\PER>. . We were supposed to have four, but I was the only one and one of these rafts actually went down through <LOC>Wallingford<\LOC> <LOC>Bridge<\LOC> luckily without mishap and so I was asked how would you bring the last raft back because the last one has got to bring the half floating bay and instead of having I think eight rowers there was only room for six. So I said having carried out… gone to work with my father when I was a schoolboy he as a lighterman his job was each day to bring the loaded barges ashore, he worked for <PER>Tate<\PER> and <PER>Lyles<\PER> at <LOC>Plaistow<\LOC> <LOC>Wharf<\LOC> just above <ORG>Woolwich<\ORG> and these loaded barges 200 tons of sugar would be moored up at the buoys of a float and when the tide came in he would bring them ashore to be offloaded and the sugar would go in for refining, though he became an expert in shearing barges ashore. . Now there’s a great art, people don’t know that it is done. What happens is: if you hold a barge at an angle by tying the rope up on shall we say on one side of the barge a little bit back from four foot right forehead then it is held at an angle to the stream and in the same way as a kite would shear upwards and overcome the force of gravity, a barge can be made to go sideways. Now if the rope, the really then becomes the radius of a circle and the barge travels along the circumference actually going up stream. So with a 3 knot tide running on the Ebb, this barge is travelling across on its way towards the burst where it will be discharged and I learned from my father that the art in shearing is knowing exactly when to let go and you wait for just when she begins to turn at that moment there’s a vortex, there’s a bit of a hole in the water on the lee bow and that straightens her up and she shoots in shore and I did this with the raft and because it was the last one, you could imagine there was about 120 men ashore waiting to see the last one because they expected us to go down to the bridge, But having any rope that you like, have any length from the stores field park pickets driven into the bank. . I had a <LOC>Jersey<\LOC> fisherman who knew how to handle an ore standing right aft and away she went I tucked the bite underneath the fender, which was like the handle on the pontoon and you can imagine being sort of catamaran you got two bearing surfaces sheared beautifully, it was like a box kite and of course she came towards midstream climbed up stream let go fell along side and she finished up opposite were she started. Now my mates afterwards said well it’s impossible no-one rowed because the six members sitting there with the oars in the upright position. Now our RSM had been posted to the company about a week before when he saw this performance and he was very very impressed because he hadn’t seen it done before. That was just before Christmas, Christmas leave. In January I was one of the sappers put on a cadre course for my lance corporal stripe. We were prepared to go; well actually we went to <LOC>Norway<\LOC> as part of The North Western Expeditionary Force (NWEF). Now it’s not widely known, but its no secret there is a book called ‘Narvik’ where the truth is there for all to read. . The intention of war office that we would invade <LOC>Norway<\LOC> to capture the ice free port of <LOC>Narvik<\LOC>, <LOC>Norway<\LOC> was neutral because the Baltic was frozen up and all the Swedish iron ore went on a railway line through the mountains and finished up at <LOC>Narvik<\LOC>, which was an ice free port warmed by the <LOC>Gulf<\LOC> <LOC>Stream<\LOC>. So we wanted to ensure that we had a good supply off iron ore for the rest of the war and the Germans had the same idea. Now we know they knew we were going and they got there first. So I was actually on a boat, Polish troop ship called ‘Batory’. On the 6th of April knowing that I was one of those about to invade <LOC>Norway<\LOC> and we were in Scapa Flow on the 9th when we heard on the radio that the Germans had marched in ahead of us. It took about 4 days to get across zig zaging we landed on the island of <LOC>Hinnoya<\LOC>, <PER>Harstad<\PER> there were Scots Guards and Irish Guards there, we were in good company and eventually we went to a little hamlet about 19 miles from <LOC>Narvik<\LOC> a place called Ebon??? and our job, snow cover of course it was very very cold instead of doing 2 hours on sentry and 4 hours off you did 10 minutes on 20 minutes off so we had no sleep at night. . Are Artic gear was first class, I understand it had originally been made because there was an intention for us to go to the aid of the Fins when it was attacked by <LOC>Russia<\LOC>, but luckily that did not happen. So the Artic gear was very good now our job at Ebon??? To turn fourteen separate fields that were covered in snow into one long one to make an airstrip for fighter planes to land and this is what we did we had Norwegian horses and sledges and we got rid of the snow, but more importantly these fourteen fields were separated by ditches to drain the melting water down into the fjord and we made box drains of wood, wooden boxes all joined together and filled the ditch end, so we made fourteen fields into one. Now this took 4 weeks actually, during that time our AKAK defence was one of two anti-aircraft cruisers that we had in the navy at the time, The Coventry and The Curlew. The Coventry was our AKAK defence for a fortnight and each day fair to say everyday on three or four occasions during the day a Messerschmitt 110, twin engine German fighter bomber would come of the fjords, which were over the mountains on the other side of the fjord dived down and dropped three bombs and miss and in all the rounds that went up heavy starting… pom pom then light machine gun fire they never brought a plane down and <ORG>Coventry<\ORG> withstood this for 2 weeks then her place was taken over by The <LOC>Curlew<\LOC> and she lasted 2 weeks, but on the last day and the day we actually finished building the airstrip and about 3 hours before the Hurricanes arrived, The <LOC>Curlew<\LOC> was hit with a loss of forty men, but they did get her ashore and everyone else came ashore. . One of our sappers actually had a camera and I had a photo of her with her head up on the shore and her awash aft. She was only there for 3 or 4 hours I think and slid of and turned over and disappeared. I met a lighterman some years after and he’d lost his son on The <LOC>Curlew<\LOC> so I passed the photograph onto him. I was able to say half pasted six on Sunday the 26th of May The Curlew was lost at that place. Now I’ve had a look at a recent map of <LOC>Norway<\LOC> and I think there’s still a landing strip there, so they made good use of it. So that’s how we spent our time. Where did you go to after <LOC>Norway<\LOC>? Well actually we left <LOC>Norway<\LOC> in a hurry because on the 28th of May, 26th the Hurricanes arrive 2 days later we captured <LOC>Narvik<\LOC> and then we were surprised to get the order to damage the port installations as far as we could so we… as a waterman I knew something about ports so I was one of the group, section one went and did this job. So we damaged the cranes, the quays, the railway lines coming through a tunnel from <LOC>Sweden<\LOC> and immediately after I left we burnt up all our… … we burnt all our sleeping bags, which were really first class and The Destroyer Walker got us away from there around about the 5th of June and put us on The <LOC>Lancastria<\LOC> so transferring from <PER>Walker<\PER> to <LOC>Lancastria<\LOC> there was a gangway leading from the bridge through the catering port in the side of the ship and with the destroyer rolling it was a bit chancy, took a long time. <LOC>Lancastria<\LOC> was full up… 4 days put us out at <LOC>Gourock<\LOC> on the 10 th of June the day <LOC>Italy<\LOC> decided to come into the war on the side of the winning group, and we busied ourselves with defences, built an anti-tank ditch right across the Fife from <LOC>Kirkcaldy<\LOC> to <LOC>Newport<\LOC> (Newport-on-Tay) moved down to <LOC>East<\LOC> <LOC>Anglia<\LOC> then it was machine gun posts and various other things in <LOC>East<\LOC> <LOC>Anglia<\LOC> because we expected to be invaded. Now in 1941 war office found I was a licensed lighterman, now the trade of lighterman was brought in and that was a B group and waterman was a D group and I felt originally quite happy to leave my field company and I went to <ORG>IWT<\ORG>, <ORG>Inland<\ORG> <ORG>Water<\ORG> <ORG>Transport<\ORG> <ORG>Royal<\ORG> <ORG>Engineers<\ORG> and anyway they were mostly much older than myself who had been called up or joined up and to them I was the boat boy and by then I was a substandard corporal it was rather difficult. So I was… … soon after I joined them and trade tested I went on draft at <LOC>Longmore<\LOC> in <LOC>Hampshire<\LOC> RGFXK it was the draft destined for <LOC>North<\LOC> <LOC>Africa<\LOC> fitted out with tropical gear and that went on and on and on and sometime in June I think <PER>Hitler<\PER> invaded <LOC>Russia<\LOC>. So that draft was cancelled and it was decided we would supply <LOC>Russia<\LOC> with equipment through the port of <LOC>Basra<\LOC>. We was giving them help through the back door so to speak so I went back to our WC and told my OC, he was then major <PER>Gayslee<\PER> who ran a firm of tugs on the <LOC>River<\LOC> <LOC>Thames<\LOC>, one of the best firms really that I was a bit unhappy with my situation working with freeman who were older than I and still looked upon me as the boat boy shall we say and he said “if I could possibly get you back to your field company I will” and he was successful possibly the only lighterman that ever did it, but that only lasted about 3 months. At the beginning of 42 by then I was a sergeant I was posted to 947 in the world of transport company. There I found they were all new recruits, they were I think 18’s or 19’s and I think around about 40 years old the extreme end of the call up group and the OC said “well with your battle experience and the fact you were a sergeant” reduced to corporal on posting was the habit in those days “you’ll get your tape back in no time” and that was true. . Then I was a full sergeant, then when the establishment went up to three WO’s a sergeant major and two WO Techs… WO2 Techs I wore the poached egg as a sergeant major and I was then 22, which was not bad going. So I was tug skipper of a very fine tug I had and eventually the OC decided when asked to recommend someone for OC2 training he gave me the offer, so I took it up and went to a special OC2 for senior <ORG>NCO<\ORG>’s and warrant officers at <LOC>Dunbar<\LOC>. So we had just 5 weeks of OC2 training and it was pretty grim up there, they really put us through it. So I was commissioned on Christmas eve 1942, home on leave for Christmas. Can you tell me about your preparations for D-Day, how you believed you were going to be involved and the feelings you had beforehand? Well by the end of 1943 it was pretty clear that D-Day was on the horizon and I had a detachment of army lighterman in the Tower of <LOC>London<\LOC> of all places and living on Shooters Hill it was jolly nice and our job was to move craft destined for the invasion from <LOC>London<\LOC> up to Ham docks just outside <LOC>London<\LOC>. . They were concrete petrol barges, barges actually made of reinforced 3inch reinforced concrete and Thames barges, which had a couple of years earlier been quickly made up to look like invasion barges and moored at <LOC>Harwich<\LOC> and places like that to give the impression, the Germans the impression we were about to invade and they were successful because a number of divisions were withdrawn from the Russian front. Then when the time came nearer it was decided not to waste them, the <ORG>Navy<\ORG> took the pick and we had what was left. So I had quite a number of Thames barges swim-ended barges with their sterns cut off and ramps fitted, two engines put in and I had those with the fleet. . I was with 953 <ORG>Inland<\ORG> <ORG>Water<\ORG> <ORG>Transport<\ORG> <ORG>Company<\ORG> when someone as a lieutenant the end of 43 when I was made a staff captain at war office and sent to war office and didn’t like that at all, I wasn’t really an in tray out tray pending tray man as you can imagine I was a 5th year apprentice that wasn’t my experience at all and then when Colonel <PER>Gayslee<\PER> arrived and said we have these marvellous invasion craft that were perfected in the <LOC>Mediterranean<\LOC>, there unsinkable. There 180 foot long, 42 foot wide, there just 5 foot deep, there pontoons self-propelled, just 5 foot from bottom to the deck, had 2 engines on a ramp forehead and there designed so that LST or, vehicles and guns equipment could be landed on beaches, which were not suitable for LSTs to land. It should be appreciated that an LST, which could carry 80-100 vehicles in two decks, 350 foot long when they are ready for beaching there 9 foot deep aft and 3 foot deep for head. . So ideally they should be put on beaches, which have a slope of something like 1 in 30 or 1 in 40. Now eventually it was decided that we should land in <LOC>Normandy<\LOC> for a number of reasons. What evidently war office decided that if we attempted to land at any of those places, which were very well defended success was very very doubtful and we should consider landing at a place that was considered not desirable for LSDs. . Now <PER>Normandy<\PER> was chosen because you can say the coming up to the land itself the approach, there was an approach that has a slope of 1 in 300 and then the beach itself, that’s the bit that is sometimes dry when there’s a high water leap tide. So that sandy bit of soft beach had a nice slope of 1 in 30, but after from then on it went out for kilometre slope of 1 in 300. So this meant that LSDs would have to come in at high water time now <PER>Rommel<\PER> was put in charge of the defences along there in the summer of 43 and he asked when arriving, why isn’t this place defended. Well they won’t come here because its unsuitable for LSTs and evidentially he said they can land anywhere and as a result of what he did some defences were put in place just before the sandy bit because he believed that we would rely heavily on LSTs and the only time we could land there would be at high water. . If they came in at any other time they would run aground with 9 foot of water aft and 8 foot for head and would have to sit there and wait for the water to drop and so they would be sitting ducks. So he said they would have to come at high water and all the defences will be put there. Well now someone decided that no LSTs would land a beach whilst the beach was under fire and that the last mile would be done by a fleet of ferry craft. . Now the ferry craft ranged from an LCM, which carried one vehicle and LCTs that carried possibly up to twelve I’m not sure about that, but then way ahead of them was the Rhino ferry 7000 square feet of deck space unsinkable because they were made up of 180 separate steel boxes, each measuring 5 foot by 5 foot by 7 foot and we could put vehicles ashore in 2 foot 6 of water. Ted can interrupt you there and ask what where your feelings going into D-Day, your responsible for quite a large number of people and a large number of ships? Well you know the British and Canadian forces were Sword, Juno and Gold. Well my company had all the responsibilities for the Rhinos on Gold so I had 15 of these now we joined up with our ship around about the 2 nd of June I believe in The Solent and we had been on exercise at <LOC>Hayling<\LOC> <LOC>Island<\LOC> previously and learned quite a bit about the problems it was decided during those exercises that we should have our own bulldozers to give us a shove off because the propellers were a bit suspect in shallow water and so those bulldozers were chained to the deck and the RB19 cranes that we used by RESC people they were chained to the deck because they didn’t go into an LST very well And well D-Day was supposed to be 5th of June, but it was postponed and we left on the night of the 5th round about 10:00 or 11:00 it was still light. Past the needles and I was pretty sure or convinced that they must know we was coming. If you’ve got 2000 ships in the Solent all you need is one agent on The Isle of White and I imagined that it would be pretty horrible when we got there, but it was horrible enough, but I had taken the precaution about a fortnight before D-Day. . I’d attended a meeting at a place called a brick ship called H.M.S Squid. The admiral in charge there and there were officers who were responsible for a variety of things and my responsibility… I was the ‘Rhino King’ and on our last meeting we were told that it would be the last and we were asked to name one thing, which worried us more than anything else and I said well when we get over there I imagine everything will be going ashore and nothing will be coming of a float. And I know my men will carry on working until they run out of things to eat, so if they go 3 days without something to eat and at that there was general laughter you know you could predict that somehow there craft would finish up on the shore unable to get a float. . So this admiral came out with words I never thought anyone could give other than <PER>Churchill<\PER> he said “ oh no you needn’t worry about that I will send a signal to every ship in Gold force that whenever a Rhino crew come along side requiring a hot meal they shall be given one” and I’ve copied the top secret information that states that. Although feeding is an army matter every vessel must be prepared to give Rhino crews a meal because every effort must be made to keep the Rhinos working. So we were the blue eyed boys that whatever we wanted we got so we arrived D-Day morning it was pretty lively, I thought I’d be in the first one ashore, but <ORG>QMS<\ORG> <ORG>Tech<\ORG> <ORG>Newcome<\ORG> a fellow apprentice of mine he had the first one because they wore a poached egg so we always called them sergeant major <PER>Newcome<\PER> you can’t call someone <ORG>QMS<\ORG> <ORG>Tech<\ORG>. . So <PER>Newcome<\PER> had the first one in and I’m not sure because we were split up. Half the ships in Gold force were American LSTs and the one I went over on was American. Now the most gratifying of morale raising thing that I cane across was that one in four LSTs was fitted out as a hospital carrier, they could not be called hospital ships because they were armed, but they had pipe cots in the tank deck, there were REMCs surgeons aboard the ward room was the operating theatre, so when I had my breakfast over the table there was this huge operating theatre lights. You can imagine breakfast was a rather silent affair and what happened we arrive, we were towed over on the LSTs stern anchor wire we were put aboard by LCVP by the crew unfasten the wire while we motored around the front of the LST, they put their anchor on line anchor, the doors would open and the ramp would come down and rest on the back end of the Rhino and immediately all the vessels in the tank deck would come aboard us, half the ships load what 30 – 40 sometimes 50 vehicles if they was small enough. Then we would storm into the beach do the last mile and the survivors those who managed to get back would go back and in two runs empty an LST and they would hot foot back to the <LOC>UK<\LOC> to do another load. Now when the hospital carrier was, when we were taking vehicles in on the second run, when we got half way through the process you’d see a column of ducks come out from the beach loaded with wounded, possibly fifteen to twenty ducks and while waiting they would go around in a very orderly circle and as soon as the last vehicle came aboard us, raised the ramp we’d storm into the shore and when we looked back we could see the LST lowering its ramp into the water the ducks drove straight up into the tank deck everyman had a label on him describing his wounds and his needs and someone decided on priorities and they were operated on, on their way back some of them on their way back to the <LOC>UK<\LOC>. One of my sergeants, sergeant <PER>Shepard<\PER> terrible shrapnel wounds in his back, multiple wounds in his back. Like the rest of us he left about 11 o’clock on the night of the 5th and he was back in <LOC>Netley<\LOC> <LOC>Hospital<\LOC> 2 o’clock early morning on June the 7th having done the return trip in under 30 hours now that’s how they looked after the wounded. . So you can well imagine quite often men said to me somebody’s looking after them, we don’t know what’s happening ashore, but really in the army you get used to a certain amount of chaos, but here was order and it made a tremendous difference to morale. What was it like on D-Day seeing the number of casualties, but also watching those young men going ashore? Well for me it has been said that the officers were the lucky ones because they had something else to worry about and you can imagine was I worried, I was responsible for fifteen of these things and I wanted it to go well. In <LOC>Norway<\LOC> thinking about myself and not very well trained I was so frightened I felt ill, but I didn’t have the same feeling in <LOC>Normandy<\LOC>. . There were frightening occasions I got a shell split in the middle of my forehead, it bleed a lot, but I had a field dressing an awful yellow it was when it stopped bleeding I took that off, and carried on. Any lower I would have lost an eye any bigger… it was a splinter from a mortar shell. When the mortar shells landed on the shore not in the sand, when they landed in the sand they go straight up, but when they landed on the shore on the hard concrete bags of concrete put there the splinters went everywhere, but it didn’t put me out of action. I was concerned that as many Rhinos as possible would get off and do a second run. Now three of mine… these beach defences those pit props each with a tela mine or mine shell on top. . Sappers had gone in earlier and made a path through these pit props 100 foot wide just over twice as wide as a Rhino, and so we would go in we had to land only between jig red and king green, couldn’t land anywhere else because the mines weren’t cleared. It was worrying because I wanted everyone to get off a float, off a float there was commander <PER>Haywood<\PER> <PER>Longsdale<\PER> senior officer ferry control and I had the biggest vessels in this fleet by far, so I had everything I wanted from him. Ashore there would be a beach major who would give my men orders, which LST to go to because I couldn’t be everywhere at once and that was done. . Three of my Rhinos actually sat on mines, which evidentially come unstuck from these pit props in the preceding months and were buried in the sand and they sat on them and they went off. So on each occasion we lost possibly a dozen of our 180 steel boxes and there were casualties of course, but we had 160 odd to keep us afloat, the outside strings were held by those hedgehogs you often see so we lost a bit of buoyancy there, but we reckoned on putting the vehicles ashore in 2 foot 6 of water and the photographs show them travelling ashore with certainly that amount of free ward. . So people were concerned about keeping busy, we were told to expect smoke to be laid at twilight time when it was considered planes would have the advantage and I knew that smoke, like fog whatever our Rhinos hit would sink because a very sharp steel corners. We’d left our mark on LCTs in <LOC>Southampton<\LOC> water more than once while we were preparing. So the orders were when they lay smoke, stop engines unless your very close to the shore and wait for it to clear. Now one of my Rhinos actually stopped and while he was waiting for the smoke to clear he drifted in front of the beach net and he motored back in the dark and put his Rhino in, in one of these cleared lanes and the first vehicle down the ramp hit a mine, under the sand. So he managed to withdraw and come back in alongside and he was rubbing alongside the pit props that remained and I’ve never known a tela mine fall of one of these, they were so securely made fast. . Now he happened to have a brigadier aboard so his number rank and name was taken and he was the only man in the company to get a mention in dispatches on D-Day. We were told if we could last 4 days and be still at half strength we would have earned all our wages since enlistment and we were there well 12 out of my 15 carried on until the end of September, but 9 Rhinos I’d turned into a floating pier so other landing craft of the ferry fleet wouldn’t need to go onto the beach, they could come along side my floating pier, each one with a hole in the middle. <PER>Ted<\PER> so you were there for longer than expected, what was it like seeing so many casualties coming back, did you have a chance… … how much of a chance did you have to think about your own mortality and safety? Well I must say I was so concerned about keeping the beach major satisfied and my goodness he needed some… two of my Rhinos didn’t get off a float for a second run D-Day because they were damaged and senior officer ferry control was pleased, actually one of my Rhinos went adrift on the way… broke adrift because It was very rough just of St Catherine’s Point. . The skipper put the crew aboard and they came back into the Solent imagine going up a one way street all the traffic coming out of the Solent and there going the wrong way, but we still carried on and when LSTs could beach when the beach was no longer under fire the used to go in on the ebb tide wait for the tide to drop, and so you see pictures of them sort of stranded and they didn’t need us. So we then were kept busy loading cargo out of the Liberty ships, cargo ships. The advantage of a Rhino was when we were alongside we could plum three holds so Stevedore groups <ORG>Royal<\ORG> <ORG>Engineers<\ORG> again port operating groups would be used to unload a cargo onto our Rhinos we had <ORG>NAFFI<\ORG> stores all kinds of things were loaded onto a Rhino they’d be brought into Mulberry Harbour because that was going then. . They would be brought in about 2 hours after high water, they would dry out and crawler cranes would come out and load them up into lorries and driving onto the beach. The great gale lasted on 4 days and all my craft, Thames barges and <PER>Rhino<\PER> ferries they all finished up ashore luckily on one of them finished up on the cliffs at <LOC>Arromanche<\LOC> so although they were unsinkable Rhino 28 simply bashed herself to pieces being bashed against the cliffs and so she was split up into seven units here and twenty units there and her cargo of artillery was lost over the side. So at the end of September <LOC>Antwerp<\LOC>, <LOC>Ostend<\LOC> were free so they didn’t want us in Mulberry anymore so we moved up to <LOC>Ostend<\LOC> and within a few days I was told that someone in war office had discovered that more men were actually shot with rifle fire or machine gun, more men were drowned than were shot. So it seemed that chief… … the chief engineer 2 nd army brigadier <PER>Campbell<\PER> knowing that there was lots of canals and rivers ahead in <LOC>Holland<\LOC> and <LOC>Germany<\LOC> thought it might be a good idea to have a river man to advise on what was laughingly called ‘the opposed crossing of water obstacles’ and because I was a river man, them not knowing I was just a 5th year apprentice I was sent to assist chief engineer 2nd army. Fortunately… most fortunately the Dutch state waterways the “Rijkswaterstaat” must have been asked also if they had a Dutch civil engineer a real expert a degree man who would be willing to join us and one such was liberated in <LOC>Nijmegen<\LOC> and his name was <PER>Constan<\PER> Lombrexon one of the bravest men I ever worked with because he knew that when he and I were in the forward areas no man’s land, spying out the land and reconnaissance that if we’d been captured I would have been made a prisoner, but he would have been shot because he was Dutch and no doubt they would have tortured him first because he knew so much, he knew what was going to happen. So we worked together on planning the crossing of rivers now the first big river what worried us was the River <PER>Maas<\PER>. We were across the <LOC>River<\LOC> <LOC>Maas<\LOC> near maastricht near a place called <LOC>Borgharen<\LOC>, there was a bridge there and it was in constant use, but particularly at night, there was nothing else for a hundred miles downstream, that was in either German hands or in no man’s land. So the whole of that river with four of five lochs on it all the way down, loch… weir gates were unattended. . Now what happened with weir that were left unattended all that time from October to February when we crossed was that the water went over the top of the gates scoured out the earth. Constan <PER>Lombrexon<\PER>… lieutenant Lombrexon when we were waiting to capture the city of s-Hertogenbosch said that there was some secret… there was some maps that had been hidden from the Germans there in the office of the “Rijkswaterstaat” and he wanted to go and collect these maps because they contained all the spot heights all the heights of dykes and surrounding ground defiantly what we need for crossing a river where the water level was effected by rain fall. . Now the brigadier wouldn’t let him go that close, so I was sent. So I waited for their office to be cleared and s-Hertogenbosch was… began to be liberated on the 27th of October. So I went in, collected these maps and a few hours after I left quite a number of people were killed with German shelling and our shelling too. So <PER>Constan<\PER> was delighted with our maps and they came in very useful because when we were about to cross the Maas at the end of January, all through January was snow cover. At the end of January the brigadier asked us how wide will the river be at <LOC>Gennep<\LOC> our crossing place on February the 10th. Now fortunately the thaw started and the rains were coming and with his vast knowledge of Dutch waterways he said well this river, which is now 200 meters across will be 1200 meters. . Now that’s over three quarters of a mile long and the brigadier knowing how good he was technically sappers at <LOC>Mook<\LOC> the nearest place downstream in our hands will be told to build 80 foot floating spans of bailey until told to stop, so that happened The assault took place on the 14th and 15th of February and by then the river surly was right up and over the flood plain and the bridge that was built was in fact 1222 meters long. I lost a good friend in major <PER>Jack<\PER> <PER>Locket<\PER> who was shot on The <LOC>Rhine<\LOC> crossing and I was ordered to take over his company, bring them back after VE day. Bring them back to <LOC>London<\LOC> we sailed our fleet of barges and tugs back to <ORG>Surrey<\ORG> docks stayed there and waited and got the company ready to go out to <LOC>Burma<\LOC>. Now traditionally the OC should be the last one to have embarkation leave, and I happen to be on embarkation leave when they dropped the atom bomb and I was still on leave on VJ Day. . So my move to <LOC>Burma<\LOC> was cancelled, much to my relief and I sort of wound the company down. Was sent to <PER>Marchwood<\PER> as marine and <ORG>IWT<\ORG> superintendent very very posh title and I was demobed there and when that happened I’d been in the army 6 years and 7 months. So altogether you could say I was particularly lucky to be wanted, be at the right place at the right time, you can’t beat it. You’ve seen a lot of historic incidents and also some horrific casualties, looking back on your time in the army how do you reflect on it, with sadness or mixed emotion? Well what was sad what you don’t see on film on the news is men lying there, there not all in one piece, they just do not show men with bad injuries occasionally you see men that have been burned in tanks, I’ve seen them since, but you don’t get the really horrifying injuries. They were quickly covered and removed, but in the first few hours it was pretty lively. There’s a special noise that a bullet makes when it ricochet it’s a buzzing noise and you can imagine that one sort of tearing a nasty hole in you, but you pressed on and I’m happy to say that it the minds of most men the fact that if you were hit you’d be on your way home straight away was a jolly good feeling to think someone’s looking after them, I know I’ve said this before, but it’s the thought that stays with me. . Now well getting on a bit there are only two of us left <PER>Ducky<\PER> <PER>Bates<\PER> 93 now, the only man awarded in the company for his work on D-Day. So its regret to think that so many men had to die, it was on the whole pretty well organised it was brilliant for someone to decide to have a fleet of ferry craft. It fooled the Germans and it worked because it was lovely to go a ground and the beaches were there in view ahead of you a hundred two hundred three hundred yards away. . So that’s a memory and since as a freeman of the waterman’s company I’ve met up with my colleagues who were apprentices in 1939 and 40 and I say there’s just two of us left out of 308, men just 2 of us! And I consider myself very lucky indeed so there you have it. <LOC>Norway<\LOC> I was 20 and I was sure I would never get to 21 now that’s… I was… I felt ill with fear and wondered if anyone else felt as bad as I did because we were all hiding it, I don’t know how they felt but I know how I felt. But I was really too busy on D-Day it’s the truth, scared of course from time to time, but not simply terrified as I had been in <LOC>Norway<\LOC> because it was a very sad place no success no success at all… and that’s it’s a little bit of success and adrenaline flowing of course. . Yes I never felt quite like that again. Of course the army training was also responsible you feel… you don’t behave I mean Sappers, I mean you’re not in a brigade of Guards and so we apprentices, we had different ranks and different responsibilities, but there’s none of this… instant automatic obedience. One of my sergeants, sergeant <PER>Maxwell<\PER> I needed a Rhino in a hurry in an emergency, went round they got 7 days growth, they hadn’t been ashore and I got there we haven’t seen an officer since we got here, did you stop working… “No” that’s why you aint seen a bloody officer. . You see he said “well right do this job and you can stay ashore for 4 days” oh no they don’t want to stop ashore for 4 days, tin treacle pudding or ice cream, which we hadn’t seen for 4 years or white bread, Americans, coffee on tap, individual packets of cornflakes with maple syrup… oh my goodness compo ration no let’s stay afloat. Very well then you’ve earned it so they stayed afloat. Half the LSTs were yanks… lovely… lovely. You were one of the first people… did you enjoy the American company because actually most people that I’ve spoken who were in the military had a dislike of the Americans and the way they did… … the way they ran their military? Well yes I had a dislike, but when I was with the 2nd army I learnt to trust them because on the <LOC>Rhine<\LOC> for instance they were… they were across the Rhine further upstream so we knew one meter rise in the last 24 hours in the 9th <LOC>US<\LOC> army sector at a certain place would mean at <LOC>Xanten<\LOC> where we were going to cross and <PER>Wesel<\PER> and <PER>Rees<\PER> where perhaps a metre rise there would mean half a metre here or a metre rise somewhere else would mean two metres here you see. . So we relied on their information and it was very very good so each day I had to tell the brig <PER>Constan<\PER> worked it all out, but in time… You’d have a graph to say well in <LOC>La<\LOC> <LOC>Meuse<\LOC> (Maas) for instance 20 centimetres rise at <LOC>Namur<\LOC> will 3 days later mean a 1 metre rise at <LOC>Borgharen<\LOC> I can’t remember the details but that kind of information. . So we could say the <LOC>Borgharen<\LOC> you could imagine if you don’t get any rain the bridge goes down down and your float your bits like that, this bit is the half floating bay ( is demonstrating this as he’s talking) so they go down down down eventually these two corners touch and so you had to stop the bridge, dismantle this lower the bank seat and bring it down again. So on doubtful days you had to tell the brig its safe. Downstream at <LOC>Roermond<\LOC> the Germans had charted the weir gates, the loch and weir… the nearest loch and weir downstream now if they only had a <PER>Constan<\PER> <PER>Lombrexon<\PER> working for them they’d of said a we’ll keep all the gates in and when there’s no rain for a period we’ll be holding all water and then we’ll blow up the gates and our water would drop. . So in those days presuming the Germans would know how to do this because it made good sense we would say if they blow up the weir at L???? today our bridge would collapse. Now one day we had a report the people at <LOC>Borgharen<\LOC> to the north a very loud explosion during the night so <PER>Constan<\PER> and I said well they wouldn’t have blown up the bridge. Now the next day I was supposed to fly in an <LOC>Austa<\LOC> to spot the flooding so I said to the pilot would you be prepared a little bit of ground mist to go towards L???? and I can see it in the distance I’ll know if they’ve blown it up. My delight yeah it was absolutely in ruins so I was the first man in the British army to know that L???? had been bombed also that they bombed it at the wrong time because the river was in flood and the brigadier was delighted no longer did our… …the safety of <LOC>Borgharen<\LOC> bridge be determined by the Germans at L???? last year I went back for the first time and I got pictures of myself by the brand new gates that they built there.
