this was different as churchill described the worst journey in the world and it was horrific on occasions the ship could get bitterly cold conditions covered with ice over the guns and deck all of the rest of it which meant you had to chip it all of otherwise you were vulnerable and if it was not the icey conditions it was still bitterly cold but you run into gale force winds and mountainous seas the sort that would take you to the crest of the wave twenty thirty feet in the air and then drop you down into the troth and as you were going down the judder and shuddering and the whole ship would be shaking and then you'd become complete awash with the wave and you wouldn't whether or not you would stay afloat did you ever and sometimes the conditions were so bad that we could go off watch and go back to our deck and find it awash with three or four inches of water plates having sprung from some of its rivets and there was only one way to get rid of it and that was to put the water in the buckets and then hand it in a chain and pass it up through the ladder through the hatchway and throw it over the side very very and very helpful when you've just come off watch and all you want to do is sleep if you could you know i mean the conditions the weather conditions are one thing obviously another big problem with arctic was you either had u boats on you or you were obviously under air attack do you remember any of that very much yes indeed we certainly the u boats oft times we'd get what you call a ping on the asdic and then you start pursuing them oft times dropping depth charges but in our experience we never actually encountered one on the surface we seemed to do this when they were unwater whether or not we scored any successes it was hard to know because sometimes there was oil but whether they were just releasing it what was the role of the saumarez you know what its duty on the international convoy was just talk about its strategy and its positioning etc well we because of the we could get up to thirty two knots and therefore we were oft times covering the perimeter guarding the other cruisers aircraft carriers or battleships if they were so we were more or less scouting as it were and viewing the horizon to make sure a lot of my job was on lookouts you know making sure there was no enemy aircraft or enemy shipping or u boats or for that matter any aircraft so this was our role really did you did you get ashore in polanyi or murmansk certainly in polyarny yeah can you remember what it was like yeah a bit desolate we did manage to play football on some icy pitch there but there wasn't really much to recall the only people that would be likely to speak to you would be young children and some of them could speak english some english but they seemed to train to ask about the radar to find out what they could about the radar but of course we were warned about this really wow i've never heard that mhm yes because they didn't have it apparently
