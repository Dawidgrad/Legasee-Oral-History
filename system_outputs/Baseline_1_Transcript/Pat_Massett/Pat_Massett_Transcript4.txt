are there any stories i can remember it any little moments that you can think all that was a funny story or sisto and it used to be a while i was at the isle of white we used to go to the americans in on ships and they were very friendly they wanted to chat as soon as they came in who are you what is your name and everything like that and what i had a i was there one day and answered the call from one of the ships and he said what is your name and i said cherry blossom that was the name of our boot polish to a cherry blossom you see and then he had a chat and he said i'll call you again tomorrow course at that the day the next day i was there and we had a and well when i thought he was old he was probably in his thirties at the time he had three barges he'd been in the navy twelve years so he must have been about forty and all of a sudden he said who a bloody hell is cherry blossom and i just didn't say a word it was rather fully ha ha so thought i had better not say that again but they were they were very friendly very often people would make dates with with some of the ships they come in and get chain but it was it was a good job we were all very much doing what we had to very serious very serious and at night it used to be very quiet and all of a sudden you'd see the ships gliding through and it was beautiful perhaps the moon was shining and you'd have three or four destroyers coming along all in line and you had to you had to signal to them and find out which ship which who they were and they would answer back and give their number and an it but it was good it was good we had to be on the ball very often there was only one person on duty did you see many german planes coming were you ever attacked we did i'm trying to think we did get aircraft over i 'm trying to think at dartmouth say that it was bombed while i was there but the isle of white know we were never bombed we were never bombed at all but no i never used to see many aircraft at all i can't say that i ever noticed an aircraft ok all right let's just talk a bit about this of the build up then to see day and terms of you know will you told how did you saw a clear sense of this esculation describe what you were seeing and do and one of the things that we did see was an odd looking ship that was going through more or less every day seemed to be to weeks for weeks and after we found out i did make inquiries because i thought was a ship doing and it looked a bit different and we found out afterwards it was it was called the thing itself was called pluto which said pipe line under the ocean and it was all the pipes being laid out to france to be out there so that it would be helpful to get all the fuel out there and that seemed to be going on for months and months and months but other than that there didn't seem to be any any different ships would come and go in and out and and there was nothing nothing very much that was on at all until the thing really started whenever it wasn't like it wasn't like dark much i think i found out of after dark mesa americans came and they had a lot doing there but it was nothing like that at cos it was just ships going through all the time more or less to southampton of course when de da went what we heard and then we were told that we're going to be very busy at detail we'd have to send messages and we were told that we might have to just spend all day on duty which we didn't mind at all but when d day did come we didn't have to do anything it was the boat crews that had the work to do because they had to have their orders work it had to be delivered by hand to the commander of each ship so all the ships were in and that's what happened
