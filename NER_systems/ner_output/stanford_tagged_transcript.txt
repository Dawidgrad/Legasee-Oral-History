 i was born in london at city road hospital nineteen twenty six my mother told me that the snow was up to the windowsills i'd imagine this was on the ground floor within a few days i was a poorly baby i went down with double pneumonia which was one of the child killers of those years and therefore i was on open order open order meant that every twenty four hours they checked you just to see if you were still alive and any of your relations come in at any time to see myself and my mother of course in the bed by the side of me to see if we're all right i was baptised in the hospital chapel and fortunately i managed to overcome that problem why did you want to join the navy and what were the circumstances around that i think really in those days it's difficult for people to envisage this now a war was on and people like myself you wanted to fight back it's like a burglar trying to break into your door normally you'll try and stop him and i was doing a certain amount with the arp air raid precautions and i really wanted to go a little bit further so i thought about it and i thought i'll try and get a little bit more involved so i went to the local drill hall where they usually take volunteers for any of the three services and this is one in edgware deansbrook road and volunteered for the navy i came along to pass all the tests i think there a few weeks later and be they excepted me and said a letter would follow but they couldn't take me at the time because i was only seventeen they said they would take me at seventeen and a half providing the job i was going to do in the navy took about six months so i would be eighteen by the time i could go aboard a ship so when i started work on the monday after that i said to the foreman well i've joined the navy and he was going no no you can't we want you here we're doing more work here you don't have to join the navy' i said i've made up my mind i'm joining the navy forget it' and another bit of luck because that firm was working a hundred percent with asbestos and at the time there was no problem but of course i find out later on nearly everybody in that firm that i knew died of asbestosis so must have been another one of my lucky lucky times from there dead on my age of seventeen and a half a letter arrived report to the drill hall where you joined and you'll be taken on from there to hms royal arthur so dually i turned up there a little crowd of us and then i a truck i think it was took us to the london station and from the london station a group of us went up to skegness and there we are at hms royal arthur there we did all joining routines get your uniform and be told lots of things about the navy lots of horror stories i'm afraid to do with what's known nowadays as i think it was venereal disease in them days which was rife i went on from there after passing all the usual tests to hms scotia where i went through the exams for a telegraphist in nineteen forty four i went down from there to hms royal arthur again and at that time d day was coming up and they had quite enough telegraphists to fit all what they wanted so they said would you like to change over to something else' i said well if you need something else' he said yes you can become an able seaman and from there there are lots of things you can aim for' so i thought i like that sound of that so although i was a telegraphist because i passed the exams went from there down to hms ganges hms ganges was tough you can't say that hard enough it was tough after being in somewhere like hms scotia which is quite easy why was it tough well because you had to be an able seaman and an able seaman as it turned out was a tough job the one thing because d day was coming up you did training to fight on the land as well as fight on the sea so we were going in for bayonet practice throwing of hand grenades amongst your ordinary seamanship jobs and d day happened while i was still there and we could hear the fighting going on the other side of harwich from the landings and we were giving blood as much as we can for the injured and we were told several times that if the fighting gets any worse and it's horrific now you'll be over there joining them whether you are fully trained or not' so fortunately fighting although injuries didn't get tougher than they were so passed out as an ordinary seaman and after that i was asked if i wanted to do what was called a suberate the suberate you could be an asdic operator a gunner or you could be a torpedoman well as i was already trained as a telegraphist being a radar operator seemed about the next step so anyway that was another short course on the isle of man are these all stone frigates that you've been training at they are all stone frigates all the land bases are stone frigates so so far i've never even seen a ship only little whalers and we did learn to sail and do all the knots and everything at hms ganges so in between that when i finished my telegraphist course and they said to me well we're not sure if we've got enough telegraphists' they said there is lots of options' so i said can i have the options' they said yep well one nice job that is coming up nowadays is a signalman on landing craft' they said well you've done all the training you only have to learn to be a signalman with the flags and so forth' but it came into my head the landing craft with me standing up the front there flag waving and the germans shooting at the flag waver so i said no i'm no hero i come here to do a job not be a hero' so anyway so i finished up as a radar operator there was two types of radar operators there was a radar p and radar gunnery control well as i carried out gunnery in hms ganges on big guns they had six inch heavy guns there that you trained on i operated for the radar control gunnery so i did that course and from there i went down to chatham which was my base anyway i was a chatham rating and waited there for a ship when you're waiting for a ship all you do is walk about the barracks jobs like painting coal white or sweeping up all different places and you go down every evening in your own time to what i believe is called the big barn and they'll have lists for people to go on draft for a ship well the first one i came across after going down there for several weeks had my name on there was quite a lot on this draft so we had to go for some reason to have a medical everyone had to pass for a medical that was on that draft what it was for they never tell you they never tell you in the navy it's known as the silent service they never told anything anyway i went for this medical examination as it came to my turn to see the medical officer he said out' i said why' out' so i stand out to one side wait for some time and then came across i said what's wrong i feel alright' he said you've got german measles' well my goodness german measles and you're fighting the germans i haven't been anywhere near <LOC>germany<\LOC>' he said don't be funny' i was out i spent a few weeks in sickbay i've got no memory at all of what happened there i don't think anything could of happened but if you're going on a draft and you're going on a ship obviously two hundred men upwards on a ship you could pass it on so in a few weeks' time my name was on another draft and this was for hms carron and we're not told we're just told we're going on a draft and the number on the draft so when the time came there was about a hundred and fifty to two hundred of us from chatham we were put on navy trucks open back but covered truck taken down to the london station i'm not sure which one it was now but all of us put on one train i don't think there was any other people on that train every one of the doors were locked locked in and a young lad by the side of me said you know what that's for' i said yeah to stop us from getting out' no it's not it's to stop the girls getting to us when we get to a station' i started to chat we got friendly none of us ever knew each other we come from all over the place but anyway that was a long trip up to glasgow we stopped quite a few times i think for air raids and for no reason i believe we stopped at carlisle and the windows were opened on the carriages lovely cups of tea and sandwiches passed across from the wvs or whoever now anyway after a little rest on started the train again as we drew out of the station i remember there was a big factory by the side of the station right on the track an old mill or something like that and out of the windows there was balloons the girls waving the balloons well not some of the balloons i can remember i think they were a little bit of another type which i won't mention but anyway that was nice we loved the fact we were being cheered on our way we eventually in glasgow and we changed straight away what must have been a local train that train took us to greenock greenock was our destination and we were then put in to what must have been a ymca a big building and we were then told that we were due to be a ships company of a brand new ship that had been built in the ship yard that was right next door to the ymca really now it wasn't ready we could go and look over the ship anytime we liked a mass of wires and people welding and i can't really remember what we did we must of walked around greenock anyway in a few weeks the ship was ready all the old wires and bits and pieces had been removed and we were given our places on the forehead mess deck we were pointed out where we had our locker where we put any clothes we were in uniform now of course our civilian clothes had gone so we just had our royal naval clothes the first of the things we had to do was go through the trials the trials were taken up the clyde to do the speed whatever was determined and a few gunnery trials anyway when we finished at the trials and the ship was commissioned then into the royal navy that was the time we was going to be off none of us was told we were going to go on a certain day so if we happened to be having shore leave we couldn't tell anybody but then one dark night shortly after we finished our trials we slipped from the dockside of the yard and edged our way up through the clyde no lights of course we closed all the water tight doors all the scuttles all the dead lights and we were given our positions that we were on watch then we were real sailors then so i was starboard watch so therefore i would be up on the half an hour on the starboard lookout we never had any actual training for this we were just told to do whatever we were told so anyway we eased out of the clyde you had to go past the boom which lets out the clyde and i remember i came off watch or i hadn't gone on watch i can't remember this stage but i had reason to go to the head which are toilets i was just sitting down and there is an enormous explosion and the doors rattled i pulled my trousers up quickly rushed out of the door into what they call the canteen flat that's the passage way and bumped into one of the other sailors who was a little bit more experienced than me have we been torpedoed on our first night out' no it's only the torpedoman trying the depth charges out' a bit shame faced i didn't know that' he said you were in the right place there anyway' so we had a good laugh about that anyway from there as i say it was a dark night why was it all so clandestine when you left this is one of the problems the enemy knew that there was ships being built nearly all the time and they would come out of the clyde or come out of the tyne or perhaps come out of ireland and if you can visualise ireland and scotland in narrows it's really wide you know it's a long distance but it narrows as a continent and therefore ships have to come in and out of that area well this was always the places you'd have two or three u boats just lurking hoping for a good kill and whether they ever found out that a ship with spies or anything that was coming out at that time i've no idea but that was the most dangerous part because none of us had worked together we'd all come out of training we'd had good training in our own jobs but of course not as a team because we were not with the same people we were training with so from there onwards as you go up through the hebrides it was really a few sailors that had experience and the officers of course that were experienced and you had to have all their knowledge to do what you were doing because you would get no escort you're a ship completely on your own with seventy five percent of the crew never been to sea at all never even seen a ship before very often so if we'd been attacked at that time we would have been a sitting duck when we arrived at scapa flow which is relatively safe we go through the boom again to get into the flow and from then onwards we do are training well the training at scapa flow really is to get you working as a team the whole ship has to know exactly what they're doing the gun crew of four or five has to know how to work together and if you're in the transmitting station which is one of the as we were as gunnery control you'd have about ten people in that room which is only the size of an ordinary sitting room and each one of those has a job to do because on a destroyer which we were hms carron was a destroyer a brand new one as well so nobody knew anything about it so we had to learn how to use the fire control table as it was when you've got eight people on it and all those eight people although they are trained on something similar in their training they still have to know how to fight if the ships attacked or if we're attacking another ship so that is what was expected of us in the flow by that time we were so short of destroyers in particular and other escort ships so not only are we staying in a nice safe area to do our training we were sent out in harness as it was called with another ship that might be more experienced and then there is one that is experienced and one that is training and that is us so we learnt it the hard way all our real fighting was around that time at the end of nineteen forty four which was october november december we was around that area so they would send us out with another ship and this is in one case we was the only ships that were in the flow destroyers and of course we was duty destroyer and hms bullen which we didn't know about at that was a ship that got sunk so we was sent out with no basic training on this we had a call to go to a ship off cape wrath that had been sunk or been torpedoed they didn't actually our message was not that it had been sunk that a ship had been torpedoed two destroyers had to go out to try and help to catch the uboat that had sunk it and pick up survivors if there was any there so there was two of us and it seemed from one of the records i've looked up the other ship that went out with us was another ship that was also working out so there was two destroyers without absolutely no experience at all had to go out to this ship i found later in life it was hms bullen which was an escort vessel and they had been looking for a u boat the very u boat they had been looking for hit one of our ships first so hms bullen had been sunk and the other ships that were with her were still looking for the u boat well the first thing we did was our skipper was very knowledgeable very experienced and he went to the position where the u boat had sunk hms bullen nobody was told anything he knew it was hms bullen none of us were told so the first thing you do you go around depth charging the whole of the area in case the u boat is still there well we picked up an echo which told our asdic operator that there was something down there which could be the u boat so we depth charged that area and apparently the echo didn't move it stayed there so we assumed that that was a u boat and it never came up never got any oil never got anything so at that time in the war the snorkel had only just started which helped them later on in the war now if this u boat didn't come up within twenty four hours then it was a dead duck so we waited around there all night with a boarding party ready to go onto the u boat because it would have had to come up for fresh air if it had of been and then it seemed we had to go on another job i don't know whether we received the message but we had to go on an escort job so we stood down the whole team we stood this was the next morning we stood down the boarding party and i was looking over the side of the ship i had no work to do i was off watch i could see in the near distance a magnetic mine float past but nobody shot at it which they might of done usually in case there was a u boat down there they would know we was still there we was on silent routine all night you never started your engines because you didn't want that u boat if it was still alive down there to know we was still up there waiting so in the end we went back to scapa flow and carried on with our learning to fight a war tell me about christmas in skapa well this i told you about was the sixth of december some more jobs we might of done there i'm not sure but the next important thing that i can remember is that we are not required for work around the christmas period so we were back in scapa flow and it was quiet and we were safe but none of us has had a christmas away from home before this and there we all were in a dead place scapa flow scapa flow is a terrible place dead as anything and what surprised me there is two hundred on a ship roughly two hundred ships complement and luckily we had a few amongst us that were experienced and there we were the cooks in the mess making christmas cakes with whatever stuff we could get hold of we also managed to get i'm not sure where from a christmas tree from somewhere and that is run up on top of the mast on top of every ship at christmas time if they are in harbour they have a christmas tree run up on top of the ship and we should have been served i think by the officers being christmas but i can't remember whether we were or not and you're not allowed to have drink onboard it's a dry ship but some of the old saved some of their rum ration which you're not allowed to do because there is a very high charge if you're caught but the officers normally on a small ship like a destroyer close their eyes to lots of things that they wouldn't be allowed to on a big ship that we call a passer ship so many of the lads that were allowed rum i wasn't because you're not allowed rum until you're twenty and i was only eighteen but out came the rum ration horrible i hate it and people made up things out of paper some paper red green and blue came from different places out of hidey holes and that was made into decorations and we were moored at a buoy there at the time and we would sing christmas songs some people had instruments so we had a small band onboard and i suppose some of our lads that come from homes that never had it bad i think they were very tearful for them i came from a home that we didn't have much money so christmas wasn't much different so anyway we all enjoyed our first christmas away from home at a lace like scapa flow so that was quiet good commander wilkinson was our captain and everybody would have given their life for him really after we'd been with him for a time although it was very strict he was a lad the same as us later on in the story when we go to the far east i'll tell you a little bit more about it we had water polo teams and he was on the team with the lads against the officers and that was the type of person he would be and i think he was boxing champion of the fleet or part of the fleet and yeah he was such a nice person you know and there is another case that i will tell you when i go ashore but the next thing we went on really after christmas was when we really started learning that there was a war on we would still go out as a ship working up together but the first one we went out with i believe two aircraft carriers and this was to be a strike against norway we didn't know until we were out at sea that we were doing this but there was these two aircraft carriers some more destroyers i think and some other ships now are job was not only to protect one of the carriers but it was also to act as a life boat really when the aircraft took off and i think a couple of these were old type aircraft i can't remember the name of them but they were bi planes now this was a really rough day and they took off and i watched them i was on watch all the time and i watched them from the deck and the carrier was bouncing up and down and they took off and i think they carried out or tried to carry out their task but the two i saw come back didn't make it because the ship was dancing up and down the aircraft carrier dancing up and down and i believe one of them hit the deck and was pushed overboard that's with the people in it they can't take them out pushed them overboard to make room for another one landing and the other one disappeared i think he was given orders to try and fly back to his base or a base because it was too rough to land on the aircraft carrier we were crash boat i think it was called we went to try and find the aircraft that had ditched sadly no aircraft so anyway i think they had to call off the strike because it was just too dangerous to do anymore flying or anything like that so that was really a bad beginning to my war then we went back to scapa flow when you talk about it being rough how were your see legs terrible i was sea sick most times when i went to sea but when you are on look out or when you are in the ts which is the ts is down below and that is the transmitting station that takes the that's like a relay from the director tower which is right up the top of the ship through you in the ts to the main armament which is four four inch guns so i was a communication number the director would speak to me the two officers and the director would be speaking to me and i would be speaking to the guns but apart from the director would have instruments that would send signals down to our big computer the original mechanical computer would send that information mechanically to the guns but once i got into a position where there was excitement i forgot all about sea sickness i was okay so that was a good thing but normally if i wasn't on watch i'll be standing on the upper deck watching the sea heaving up and down probably being sick the only time you go to action stations is when you're expecting action later on when we talk about the mine laying we're at action stations all the time but if you are doing a job just escorting then you are at cruising stations until some trouble pops up depth charging a u boat is not a case of going to action stations it's only if the u boat fights back then you go to action stations so anyway we went from there back to scapa flow i think we did one or two journeys like this of the coast of norway and this is the beginning of nineteen forty five and eventually we supposedly finished our training learning working together as a team mind you all this time i'm talking about to you now we were still learning because we were still teaming up with people that we never worked with before so if we run into any real trouble at that time we wouldn't of stood a lot of chance it wasn't until later on when we learnt these things so the next one i think is an important one this is about february i believe we were just told we were going out that night and we were not given any real information about where we were going and what we were going to do but it was a very big do there was a very large force we left about ten o'clock at night is this out of scapa this is out of scapa this is what turned out to be the mine laying operation although there was no moon it was all star light so it was very good visibility and it was a very calm night strangely enough hardly any rough sea or anything we set out and you seldom know who is with you it's the silent service and we'd been out about an hour i believe about ten o'clock and the skipper then said over the tannoy what we're going to do he'd opened his orders and he told us that we are a big force one of the large force was going down the southern part of norway to egersund and they were going to attack a convoy we were one of two ships another one was hms zealous was a same destroyer as we were and are main task was that we had to escort this minelayer hms apollo first of all both forces working together had to pass through a big minefield there is a big minefield that was laid i think by us and we had to go through one path through it which was the only path through it but we knew where the opening was so it should have been safe enough but you do get loose mines so our asdic operator had to pick out the mines and i was on watch at one time and i could hear him saying that there is something on the port side and the captain would move the ship over a bit so anyway we got through the minefield all of us with no real problem and then we split up we were to wait until twelve o'clock and at that time at twelve o'clock the other big force we were by the way up near stavanger at that point and the other big force was two cruisers i think no aircraft carriers at that point and they were going to attack a convoy a german convoy that was going to leave egersund and was going to hug the coast all the way up to stavanger but the other force was to stop them getting there so dead on twelve o'clock the other force that was going to attack the convoy and they were hoping when that started lots of fireworks down along the coast it's quite a few hundred miles but that would take the heat off what we were doing we were a clandestine operation we were to escort the apollo to the point where she was going to start laying mines dead on twelve o'clock and we were to between her and the norwegian coast and if she was sighted by the germans or picked up by radar by the germans and they were to start firing we were to make as much noise as we could and tear up and down between the sea between the apollo and the norwegian coast and use all the guns and flares and everything we could to take the heat of her so they'd attack us so the apollo would of either flashed us or indicated to us or not i'm not sure because everybody had to keep radio silence and we were on silent routine nobody was allowed to smoke or anything you were not even allowed to bang because the noise we were not far away from the coast our two but the ships both us and the other escort destroyer the zealous had to keep up as much steam as we could because if the fireworks started we would have to at full speed rush up and down this bit of coast firing whatever we could to prevent them seeing the apollo well i could hear from the guns in the ts and from the director before we started doing anything and i could hear the people on the guns saying i can see the headlights there there only over there a little bit a car coming down from the right to the left' i could hear all this and i hope they can't see us where they are' and then he said right they've started down the other end' and they started firing down at the other end they attacked this convoy and they would have been you couldn't see that though we couldn't i couldn't see anything anyway because i was down in the ts so i was getting all the messages not from the two officers in the director tower but from my mates on a gun b gun x gun and y gun they were funneling all the information to me saying i think that blokes smoking over there hope they can't see us' apparently they didn't we didn't have to do much so we were slowly moving up and down and the apollo started laying her mines dead on time dead on twelve o'clock the minelayer it's a big minelayer they carried a lot of mines a big cruiser they are and once they start laying the mine that's where we would have had to come in they can't stop they've got to do the whole of their mine laying because the mine field is being laid so they can't turn back they can only go on and carry on laying their mines so anyway we're just going slowly up and down and because our ship was keeping steam up ready for a quick dash up and down the valve blew so you've got a normal what is a well known destroyer hoot woop woop which we do every time we come in and out of harbour just to signal and apparently everybody went mad the cruisers went mad we were in silent routine you know and the fact that we were never sussed out not until the very end and i think it might even be if anybody had heard that woop which is a well known british destroyer signal to say i'm coming in to the harbour or somewhere if they thought you know it can't be a british destroyer nobodies daft enough to do a thing like that you know so anyway they laid the mines and then we knew i don't know by signal or what just said all done we carried out our mission see you back in port' and i was at that time listening to some of the and they were saying look at her move' and she was doing forty knots she was one of the fastest ships there were and they could see the bow wave it's night but it was star light and you could see you could see the shore you could see the place where the guns were they would have had a crack at us if they'd known and away went the apollo at speed and we turned around we went as fast as we could but we were not allowed to go at a good speed because we got a signal that the germans had sussed out that they were being attacked from egersund with the battle we had going on down there and some friends of mine afterwards on the apollo i kept in touch with them they said they understood and they were in the wireless room telegraphist office they had understood that we had been challenged the force had been challenged because they had picked us up on radar the force had been challenged and he thinks that the apollo that was in charge of course had given the right challenge answer but then they challenged again later on and didn't the apollo started disappearing so they sent torpedo bombers after us and they never found us so we got back okay so the mine laying was successful our force further down at egersund had stopped the convoy going up to the german convoy had sunk one or two of the ships and one or two of are ships had injured people but this whole mission was successful it sounds to me like you were expendable when you were out there with the apollo you are i would of though a destroyer was valuable bits of kit tell me a bit about the role of a destroyer and it's comparable what i shall bring in is because later on towards the end of the war which won't be in that one is when we were a big force escorting some of the cruisers out to the far east we only took them as far as gibraltar you see and then another force takes over but we were escorting a battleship the renown and we were the close escort on the destroyer each side fairly close when others were further out and it was a beautiful day like this and i wasn't on watch i was just leaning over the side but we were quite close because we were close escort you see and i'm just leaning over the side and over the tannoy comes the voice from the captain we're now reaching a dangerous area and there might be u boats around if a u boat has fired a torpedo and we see the track of that torpedo heading towards big sister' which they called the renown then we stop it you know what we mean we stop it' and there's me looking over the side looking and there is a torpedo bulge on the renown and thinking to myself yes we're going to lose two hundred men just to stop a torpedo bending a torpedo bulge you know just tell me a bit about the role of a destroyer well the role of most destroyers is they're fast and they are maneuverable and they're like a smaller version of a cruisers they have all the gunnery but smaller guns so they've got four big guns four five big guns and other small guns got all those the one thing they've got extra apart from the smaller size scaled down the big ships have not got anti submarine equipment they've got torpedoes and things unless the submarines on the surface they've got no depth charges so a destroyer had depth charges so we are there too but on the other hand the difference the reason why you've got a destroyer is just as i said if the capital ship or whatever it is we are guarding is torpedoed the last resort is you get in the way of the torpedo they'd rather lose a ship that's only got two hundred men onboard than a possibility of losing more than two hundred men on a battleship remote as it might be that it's got a torpedo bulge and this is why we we're short of destroyers because so many of them get lost because the first thing you do when a torpedo is sighted is go to attack the submarine that fired it but you should be near enough to get in the way of the torpedo if it happens to be heading you way you know you talked a bit about how you weren't a team you were a young crew is there a moment when you were onboard where you thought we're working brilliantly now well not really you just sort of fit in part of life is you manage to fit into every situation luckily enough i never worried you think because you are a good swimmer you must be alright if the ship sinks but then when you think about it and you speak to other people you've got sea boots on at the time you have a belt which should save you which you wear all the time at sea but you can't wear that belt blown up because it gets in the way of the arms and everything so what happens is if you have to jump into the ogin as they call it the sea that belt mustn't be blown up because you might break your arms so you're expected to blow that up when you hit the sea and i can't see luckily i never had too but i know survivors that have told me i had to blow it up as soon as i hit the water but i had no breath at all left so i couldn't blow it up' but the sea boots drag you down because this is what you're wearing it's just one of those things what's the next big event that you recall then it was really mundane most of the things as escort to the monsters we did your enemy in most cases was the sea we got battered left right and centre trying to keep up with the queen mary and queen <PER>elizabeth<\PER> because as we took them out of the clyde we zig zagged all the way with them and we kept up with them until they reached top speed which was for the distance all the way across then we left them or we either waited around for the next one coming in for instance we might of taken the queen mary out and we might have had to wait just a few hours for the queen elizabeth to come in and all the time one of you might pick up one of the three of you the queen mary would have its own asdic besides its own radar and we of course had the asdic and radar and our cohort perhaps the cavalier would be the same well when we'd steam out we would probably be apart at the extremes of your asdic circle and you radar circle so you didn't interfere with each other's receipt of the wave and if we picked up an echo which might have been a submarine might have been a wreck well immediately we'd run up a black flag on our flag deck so the queen mary would know and also the cavalier would know that we've picked up an echo immediately we'd hive off to attack that echo and this is where you are in trouble if it is because a u boat might of already fired its torpedo and this is where you turn off swiftly at full speed if you can if you've got a beam sea which means you can't turn off left or right you hit the beam sea a destroyer you've got hardly any draft you'll turn over straight away so you have to be very careful we never did whether it was luck or judgment i don't know anyway then if you haven't been hit by a torpedo then you'd find your wave to wherever that echo was and you would attack the echo you'd loose of about two depth charges from one side two from the other and roll off from the two racks from the rear a pattern of about ten charges well if the u boat is a very experienced one and he was watching you on the periscope he wouldn't be there when you arrived he'd of either gone down low or he would of disappeared in another direction but at least you've kept him down no chance of hitting your charge and then we'd have to try and catch it up it takes about half a day because they're keeping the same speed if the two destroyers had to leave the queen mary or the queen elizabeth the queen mary would carry on it wouldn't stop and one of the worst things that could of happened if they'd actually torpedoed the queen mary then they would of lost a lot of lives because if the queen mary was coming back in it would have a full complement of american gi's and that would be between ten thousand and fifteen thousand it would be carrying now they would not be able to tighten up their water tight doors because they're going from the different decks all the time in the twenty four hours if we go into action stations then we close our water tight doors which means if you're torpedoed on one side it will only damage the compartment within so most likely the ship wont sink but if it's on the queen mary then they've got no chance of any of their water tight doors because they're travelling between the different decks they're perhaps sleeping on one deck travelling up the next deck to eat food another deck for exercise the top deck is always exercise so they couldn't close their water tight doors so any of those would have been one of the biggest disasters you'd find what was it like seeing the queen mary and the queen elizabeth sailing with you did you have any pride was they ships that you knew of and were proud of anyway well all we really knew was going to pick up one of the monsters or bring one of the monsters in if it was the queen mary and we were in greenock then we would of known it was the queen we were taken out and that's always got three funnels anyway if we picked it up if it's got three funnels it's the queen mary if it's got two funnels it's the queen <PER>elizabeth<\PER> and so on you've got four funnels with the aquitania and so it went on you were never told you would just sail out and go to a rendezvous where you would wait around or you've already contacted that ship to say you were there and you'd bring it in very often even we two escorts one would be at greenock at the clyde and the other would be down at liverpool and we would meet a point of rendezvous going out of the clyde and the other one cavalier perhaps come out of liverpool and then we would steam up together to the rendezvous point for the monster this happened once or twice a week for one of us we never had the same cohort because they wouldn't always be in the same area they'd be doing something else and between that if you're duty ship if there was an aircraft carrier which happened in one case had been torpedoed we'd just come down from scapa to greenock and we'd just arrived at the harbour entrance we went straight to an oiler because you always have to fill up with oil because you might have to go out and just as we were at the oiler we got an emergency call to say that an aircraft carrier had been torpedoed just out in the clyde at the beginning of the clyde so we just let go from the oiler and straight out to the an aircraft carrier and strangely enough she was on her own she come from londonderry she'd had no escort and luckily she didn't have a full complement of seaman and so forth and she was coming to the clyde i don't know why but they torpedoed that they torpedoed a merchant ship at the same time and the u boat got away so we went to attack it it was dark and we left the others i think looking for the u boat afterwards when we came back into harbour how long are you at sea when you are out in the atlantic and how often are you going back to base and getting your land legs in a destroyer not very long because you haven't got that much fuel and you're always using your top speed always maneuvering the only way of getting fuel if you are out for a long time is from one of the bigger ships wither from an aircraft carrier or if it's as big as the belfast or a cruiser or something like that and also food your food runs out after a short while so the only time we were really out for a long time is when we were up at scapa when we was working up when we was going out on forays to help sink the tirpitz or doing other jobs most of the others it was a case of going out just for a day or two just picking up one of the monsters and then come back with a monster or take one out and leave it it which case we would have to go to londonderry perhaps and then we come out of londonderry again you know and go out on that so we were lucky on that respect that we were not out for very long there is only we was out for a very long time it must have been over five days i can't remember what the occasion was but we had run out of food and we was further up in the north atlantic and our captain was an ex fishery fleet man he had his own fishery fleet so what he decided to do as we run out of food he said i know where the fish are so he guided the ship up too where he knew they were picked up a shoal on the radar on the asdic dropped a depth charge lowered a boat picked up all the fish that came up stunned he stood on the foc'sle we saw him stood on the foc'sle and said that one mine' picked the biggest one and we lived on fish a few more days after that but our runs were mostly just about five days at a time but that meant every time we came into either scapa or if we were in liverpool or to the clyde we had to always have plenty of fuel onboard because if you're duty destroyer and then something comes up where a ship has been sunk you'd have to go out straight away and you might be out for a long time looking for a submarine or more than a submarine so we were lucky in that fact that we never went out for a long time otherwise it would have been oiling at sea which is a dangerous practice anyway and picking up food and everything from it can you just describe radar this is the job you were doing yes radar yes well first of all when i was on a radar set it's only a small set and there are different types the two ninety three that is high up on the mast specially for picking up aircraft or surface ships really any distant i can't think of the range of it but it sends out a signal from there which of course if it doesn't hit anything you don't get it back but if it hits anything even cliffs or an aircraft or a surface ship then it bounces back and on the screen which is a round screen and the curser is going around all the time that will show a blip and that blip you have to be able to determine whether it's a cloud which it might be depending on your radar if it's doing vertical or angler and then you'd read off the distance angel and everything this is mostly on a level but you have another screen that gives you the height of an aircraft so you use one with the other when that electronic signal hits anything then it returns and then you read of the distance of it is it easy to use it's easier to use where you find the difficulty is by experience very often you know what you are looking at either the land because of the size of it on there if it's a small blip its and aircraft a ship whatever if you know you are using one type of radar it's only horizontal if you're using the other one it could be horizontal or an aircraft and it would give you a good distance the time it takes of course it's based on if it takes ten seconds from there to there its and you read it off the screen luckily at our point in the war we never had any trouble with aircraft only times we had problems with that is if the torpedo bombers had been sent after us of norway then we would have had to use are then we would know we'd have to use the two radar sets then the one that gives you the signal with the height of the aircraft and the other one that gives the distance of it then you are trained to know which is the distance and i also believe as far as i remember if it was one of our own aircraft it would have an identification signal which you would know on your radar set before it got to you so you'd have to be pretty well experienced but my time was not always on a radar set you were sometimes on lookout as a seaman where you are sitting up in a lookout box and starboard side was mine and you are looking out for aircraft which was not very often surface ships or more than likely you're looking out for a little tiny periscope which is very hard to see in the rough atlantic or you might be unlucky enough to see the track of a torpedo coming towards you in which case you get into a panic and call out quickly to the people on the bridge what is said the people on the bridge the captain or the officer on watch at the time in those days it was an open bridge nowadays it's enclosed but it was an open bridge so the bridge is here and you've got a look out position just here so you just call out to that person on the bridge duty officer chip bearing red five zero green five zero whatever your position is angle of site if it was an aircraft and he can immediately look at it and decide what action to take but if you're on that look out position which i was on quite a lot as a seaman it's rough because as the ship goes down all the time being a destroyer you're almost a submarine at times the whole of the sea comes up over you and you get knocked back against the search light and its very damp that is very rough uncomfortable but this is what you get used to you used to wear a special suit which covered you completely a water proof suit with kapok lining but even that the water got all the way day and you got soaking wet i remember coming off watch on one occasion like this because normally you have to climb down the outside ladders of the ship because the doors you would go in and out in port are open when you are at sea the doors will be closed because the water comes in those so you have to climb down ladders down the outside of the ship not outside in the sea but climb down from the top deck to the lower deck and if you're not carful the wave when it hits you can get washed away so you hold on very tight well this was the middle watch i recall which is from twelve o'clock at night to four o'clock in the morning but you're not on watch lookout all that time on the four hour watch you do different jobs half hour on lookout half hour perhaps on a radar set half hour behind a gun where you become part of the gun crew so if you did have to go into action you would do the shooting while the real gun crew is called up to take over from you well on this occasion it had been very wet outside i'd got soaking and tired and say middle of watch say about one o'clock i'd come down so i went down to my mess deck which is in the foc'sle a rough part of the ship i hadn't slung y hammock i'd slept on the cushions this time i didn't fancy sleeping on the cushions because the ship was going so much this way i knew i'd come off the cushions so i got down under the mess table there's about that much water on the floor on the deck about that much i got all my clothes on a zoot suit they called it if anything and i'm laying down there off to sleep straight away next thing i know a foot had touched me and i opened my bleary eyes and there is the officer of the watch and the leading seaman of the mess and he was saying to me and i'm told this in the morning by the leading hand in the mess he said come on seaman you can't sleep under there it is too wet' i said looked at the leading hand and said what did he say ' and the leading seaman said i don't know i don't read that language' and so we better let him sleep there and they left me there nothing was said about it so in water you're lying in about that much water on the decks of the ship inside you know inside your mess deck the water just its one temperature outside and a little bit warmer inside so all the humidity all the water runs down the inside of the decks anytime you're on the caviler you have a look on the inside because the metal work on the ships side is only about an eighth of an inch no thicker than that and so you've got water all the time on the mess decks when you're at sea and when you're in harbour you're not to bad so it gets a bit uncomfortable there was another time when we worked with the queen mary and we had to pick her up to bring her in we went out and it was in about one of the roughest storms there was about three really rough storms in the period we was working in the atlantic and we had to about this time it would be about march nineteen forty five we had to go and pick up the queen mary now the storm had been raging all the way from <LOC>america<\LOC> and it must have been a big storm that ad come across our way and the queen mary had brought it with her sort of thing and we picked her up i think we were a day or more waiting to pick her up because even she had been held up by the storm well we and i don't know what was the sister ship at that time but we got really bent up we lost a motorboat we lost one of the whalers and we got really knocked about and when we got towards the clyde knowing that it was in the area where there would be u boats we had to really on our speed and so as we got within hailing distance of the clyde the queen mary decided she could not slow down to keep up with us because it was tough rough for us we might have been turned over and so she just flashed a message see you in the clyde ta ta and she kept up her speed and got into the clyde now she had the whole of the front of her bridge stoved in it was a big ship well up in the air they had a lot of casualties because they are carrying abut twelve thousand troops and this was now late at night i think about eleven o'clock twelve o'clock at night but anyway she got into the clyde without any serious damage from the sea we limped in later on now in the clyde you're not allowed to anchor and we couldn't go further into greenock because after that you go through the boom and the boom is closed at night unless it is absolutely necessary to open the boom which prevents or helps to prevent any u boats getting in at that point so at the other side where we had to tie up to a buoy we have two buoy jumpers to tie up to a boy when the ship tops and you have to lower your whaler with the buoy jumper and the rower in it to take you to the buoy with a chain to clip it to the buoy well if i've given you a picture of how rough the storm was it was almost impossible really we let down onto the water managed to get down safely that got washed away with the crew in it further down the clyde that was a way three or four hours we managed to lower another whaler all of us were up on the foc'sle all the seaman that could help was up on the foc'sle because you can't use your anchor you're just using your anchor chain which goes with a wire attached to the end of the anchor chain and the whaler has to take this wire to the buoy to clamp it onto the buoy and the buoys pulled by the anchor chain nearer to the ship so they then clip it on so anyway we lowered the second whaler the buoy jumper managed to get onto the buoy and in doing so broke his wrist and in the end after i think about four hours we managed to clip up to the buoy and the captain said tots all round' i hated the smell of rum anyway and never would have my tot because it's horrible but i had it that night because we were frozen frozen stiff we managed to get away with it nothing is said about this type of thing because although people of the ports new these big ships come in it was not a thing that was talked about because the germans also knew that they were bringing all these large numbers between ten and fifteen thousand troops it could carry and any of the u boat captains that i understand and this is normal knowledge were offered a large sum of money thousands of deutsche mark reichsmark and the highest honours to have knocked down any of these monsters but we never lost one fortunately i'm happy to say but the queen mary was really battered very badly battered how we didn't get turned over i have no idea when you are talking about big seas what sort of size are you talking well if you're talking is it the seas themselves you're talking about well it is genuinely know that some of the waves were sixty foot high now if you're thinking of sixty foot going up that way you go up to the wave and you come down to the trough you've got a hundred and twenty foot and there is no way you can cut through those waves the big ships and the small ships you actually go up on that wave and then you feel it and then you come down with a crunch like that and then you go up the next one and all the time you're corkscrewing you know you're not still and you get used to this after about the first few months because you've got bruises all over the place you go through the normal flats they're called on the destroyer normal corridor on the floor on a destroyer which is about that wide when you first go aboard one like that fairly calm when we set out for scapa from greenock but as you walk along the deck comes up to meet you as it comes up and you hit your feet as you go down on the deck but before you know it that deck has gone away as the ship goes down and this hits you from the top and then while that is happening because you're doing this this bulkhead hits you next thing you know that bulk head hits you so in time you learn to walk like a sailor and if the ship goes down you go down with it and come up with it you find sailors when you get ashore they walk with a roll that is just that they're still walking on the ship so after the end of the war ve day you're not finished ve day itself we were that's the ninth of may we were bringing in the ss ile de france and when we got notice that peace had been declared next day we were going into greenock so we actually brought in the last of the one ship convoys before the war ended and we arrived in greenock it was either wednesday or sunday half the ships company was allowed leave which wasn't me i'm afraid i wasn't one of the ships company but they went ashore to greenock and had a good time so then we still carried on with some of these convoys after there because there was quite a few u boats apparently missing a lot of them one or two of them went to brazil or whatever so there was still a chance if there was a rogue u boat around they could of knocked down some of the monsters we were still bringing back in but we had no problems at all but to cut a long story short anyway we were then destined to go across to the end of the japanese war so two by two flotilla went in for refits we went in for a refit late in may june because we were going out there anyway but fortunately when i was on leave to go out there the ship was down at devonport being refitted the war ended i've still got a telegram to say days leave extra days leave extra when we came back to the ship we still had to go out there because we were having to clear up after the war well the whole of our flotilla was out there then we were the last two so as we went out gibraltar malta aden and places like that we thought we was in for a lovely summers cruise but when we got to singapore no when we got to trincomalee that was a naval base we were based at trincomalee and we were also based at singapore well when we got to singapore this was just about a week or two after the war and we were carrying out an exercise with hms sussex and another ship and the captain the flotilla leader was on hms caesar and ourselves on cavalier were ordered to go with the sussex to a problem so we immediately went at full speed we were sent to java we stopped on a couple of troop ships on the way i can't remember much about that little bit but we took onboard a full deck was covered with indian troops armed indian troops and the cavalier was the same the caesar was also and the sussex anchored outside surabaya because it couldn't get in we could hardly get in because there was a sunken japanese cruiser in there in the way so the caesar went in first because she was flotilla leader full of troops and we went in second because we were second and then the cavalier afterwards as we went in it was daylight we had all these troops onboard so if we had any trouble we couldn't of used our guns because of the troops luckily we didn't have any trouble from the shore but as we came into surabaya i was looking over the side and there was bodies dozens of them in white naval uniforms i think they were probably dutch i don't think they was ours but we were slowly moving avoiding this wreckage and avoiding the bodies and you got to the stage now when really bodies in the water made no difference to you you accepted the fact they were bodies dead you know so anyway we slowly moved in we anchored in the dock there and one by one the cruiser disembarked her troops first and we came in next so the three of us all our troops went ashore the docks had already been taken over by the uk army i think had been brought in ahead and it was the indonesian rebels they were fighting they already had killed brigadier mallaby the army boss and these troops went ashore and we stayed there ready for a lot of survivors of the dutch people they were going to be brought across from a camp right on the other side of surabaya and they were going to be brought under escort under another truce see brigadier mallaby had been killed under another truce now this was supposed to be four thousand dutch people women and children mostly in a camp the other side they were going to be brought across by another truce army trucks guarded by indian troops they were going to be brought across to us and we were going to have them onboard and we were to take them out to the troopers which couldn't get into the harbour well we were told while we were waiting for these people to come across we were to go out into the water because we might be used which was absolutely necessary as it happened when this convoy of army trucks guarded by indian troops got as far as surabaya they were found they were stopped even though they had a white flag they were stopped by the post office which was full of indonesian rebels the indian rebels had set up trench mortars and machine guns and as soon as the convoy got there they shot the troops that were guarding the convoy and the convoy come to a halt so we were called in to use are four five guns so we had to fire on the town and we took out the post office with the indonesian troops in it and then the convoy come through we went back into harbour and we had all the dutch people on board and we took them out we didn't personally have to go ashore i had to go ashore later on to guard some of the warehouses and so on but we didn't have to do any fighting the only fighting we had to do was fire the guns because i was on the upper deck at the time when we were called in to fire and i was called off the upper deck to fire x and y gun and i said i'm not a gunner' they said you are today' they put me on the gun gunnery with another one and we had to fire and we had to fire in the direction of a spotter plane that was sent up by the army the army sent up a spotter plane so apparently we took out the post office so our good deed was done for the day we did have them aboard overnight a lot of these dutch people we vacated all the forehead mess decks and we had to sleep down aft on the upper decks and different places and the dutch people women and children until we took them out to the other ships and then we got our place back i lost a pair of sandals they disappeared how do you feel when you're sailing into a harbour and seeing a lot of dead naval people well you're apprehensive to start with but at the age you are you're very seldom frightened i suppose your adrenaline comes back later on and you think to yourself well i could have been killed there but i wasn't and that's how you took it if you thought of all these things at the time you'd be a nervous wreck but you're eighteen years old nineteen years old and if anything happens then fortunately you accept it's not fear sometimes i look back now and think i could have been killed there but i'm not i'm here so we accept it just as a fact of life it was exciting it's quite a big way to end your naval service really to be involved in a contact like that it is nice to be at this stage and know that you have done certain jobs well we must of killed people by taking out the post office but you didn't see them and you know by doing that you helped to save the last of perhaps two or three hundred of four thousand people and i had the same feeling when we were escorting the troopers the fact that we never knew that we'd sunk a submarine a u boat because we never stayed long enough all we could do was depth charge a target if that target was a u boat then we might of sunk it or it might of got away but our real job was to look after a ship coming in with fifteen thousand troops and as long as we'd saved that i'm happy but you never know but i just hope we didn't i just hope there wasn't a u boat there and those people weren't killed they were only doing the sort of thing we were doing and that was the job
 my name is rodney newham and i was born in nineteen twenty and i when i was fifteen i had an apprenticeship in chatham dockyard and for five years and then i served a time on most of the ships that came in on repairing i was in the boiler making trade more than anything else the boiler rooms and engine rooms were the ones that the ones i was employed in and i knew more about the ships than some of the sailors knew because i used to know every part of the ship even down into the shafts room the room of the shaft which goes through and drives the propeller and one of my jobs was to put safety shields over the joints of the shaft going through the ship i knew about most of the ships were all different the engine and boiler rooms more than anything and the air supplies and things like that when i was about fifteen we sat in exams for artisan apprentices or dockyard apprentices and at that time i wanted to go into the navy but at that time they wouldn't accept you in the as an engine room artificer if you had glasses because ships in those days a lot of steam come from the boilers so you never you couldn't do it so i went in as an apprentice in chatham dockyards and served five years that was nineteen thirty six in those days even when you came out of the dockyard gates children were begging there in bare feet for your sandwiches that you had over and you used to give them to the children who were there waiting for the dockyard people to come out so that they could get these sandwiches it doesn't seem possible does it but that's true yes i had a sister who was seven years older and i had a brother who was seven years younger and what happened to him i never knew i never knew but my sister she lived until about eighty three i think something like that with my sister yes and my father was a chief engineer in art in the navy he did his twenty two years you know and my mother died when i was eight so i never really knew a mother's love and care from the age of eight no so i can't say that i had a happy childhood as such not having a mother's care what do you remember of your early apprenticeship at chatham dockyard what were you actually was there a sense of war were you were you building up to war or was it just a job for you at the time well at nineteen thirty six i went into the dockyard as an apprentice a five years apprenticeship thirty six in that time the war broke out at thirty nine that's right and so i was serving the apprenticeship actually when the war broke out yes when it was when i finished i was then a qualified boiler maker which was a hard job hard work so i determined at that time that i wouldn't stay as a boiler maker so i made progress in the trade and i eventually became an inspector of trades in the dockyard that's what i retired as an inspector of trades it's a the apprenticeship of a boiler maker was a hard job it's a heavy heavy material job if you can imagine the boilers they weren't modern they were what we used to call the arrow boilers cylindrical boilers made of metal an inch thick and we used to roll it into shape imagine they were big they were up to thirty ton the cranes used to have to lift that yes it was heavy hard work boiler making was yes i know of a number of people that were killed when one of them he had a plate dropped from a crane it slipped out of the grip fell on him and killed him yes it were terrible and i remember a man being killed on the cranes used to go up and down on rails lifting the heavy well lifting thirty odd tons and one man was crushed up in the night and it was a naval officer who actually went up there up the steps as you can imagine the steps were locked so that no that other people couldn't get up but he went up there to retrieve the body or to see if he could do anything more for the body a very brave man a naval officer lieutenant he was as plain as if it were yesterday yes yes yes and it was hard did you notice did you notice to talk a bit about this escalation in the amount of work in terms of providing for the war effort well there were a number of vessels that used to come in damaged because of the war and they would be repaired in chatham dockyard and and they we used to do make gun shields and torpedo platforms that revolved for the torpedoes on and we used to do those and make those platforms for torpedoes to be fired from and things like that and gun shields we used to make made of bulletproof metal which was very hard to work with you know bit hard any other came in yeah the arethusa was a cruise i worked on and the was another cruiser and a number of riggers and mine sweepers and then when we used to do the re fits and that would mean stripping out the boiler engine rooms and renewing a lot of the stuff the air supply through the ventilations down to the engine and boiler rooms through turbo generators collecting the air and distributing it around the ship yes that was called aluminum trunking with grills on the end of the trunking and you could alter the different positions through the engines in the boiler rooms yes i used to make those grills and fit them and things like that i remember the germans coming over was quite a number of them i remember the and the arethusa the cruiser opened fire on them and i think i think a lot of the craft were italians on there that had came over because it was noticeable that the germans would have gone on but when the arethusa opened fire on them a lot of these planes changed and turned round and went back from where they come from you'd never believed would you but that's what happened yes the germans would have kept on and would have attacked their target but i think that some of the others were italians on there yes because where i should have been down under the shelter i stood up against one of the workshop walls and that was my shelter and watched the arethusa open up as she was in dock and she opened up and i was stood there with my back to the wall in the workshop and i saw these men on the arethusa stripped to the waist firing the ships and getting the shells empty shells and throwing them aside and loading again and firing that was on the arethusa yes they were really good they were they really really turned those planes around an experience course i ought to been down in the shelter but i didn't go down there yes i was given one to go to it was just a well it was a dugout and you went down steps and that was there but i wouldn't go down there i stood with my back to the wall in the workshop yes not that i was brave at all it's just that i wouldn't go down the shelters i'd rather take a chance in the war when you weren't in the dockyard or were you living in the dockyard as well no i lived i lived outside of the dockyard yes i lived in gillingham road for a time near the railway crossing you know that part of gillingham and i lived with my father there yes cos' because my mother died when i was eight but i went and lived with my dad i think we knew that we'd put it like this that we'd win in the end that we would be the victors as a nation because i think that the effort everybody was behind the war effort as far as i know yes yes i suppose it was you weren't paid a lot of money you some people made a lot of money because of the war but we were never like that we never made a lot of money because of the war being on and it was hard work these great big slabs i used to do things on with a vice a heavy vice one end of it and i used to roll plates and cylinders out of inch thick material and i used to work in the furnace and pull rings out of the furnace and round em up and you used to have to have an asbestos sheet to shield yourself from the heat that came off when you pulled it out with rakes onto a slab out from the furnace and the heat was so great that you used to hold these asbestos sheets up in front of you to protect yourself from the heat as you endeavoured with hammers large large hammers to shape to to make them into the right shape sometimes they weren't quite round and so you had to put dogs on them and shape them you just had asbestos sheets to protect yourself from the heat and the thing was that you was you made things out of asbestos sheets and you just saw it up and all the dust well you just breathed it all in no wonder so many men died of asbestos it's a i had what they call plague in both lungs which i've got now but it never it never solidified men used to breathe it and it would go solid in the lungs but i was fortunate in that mine didn't solidify so it hasn't affected me the breathing even up to well now of course it does i was fortunate because many many of my colleagues died at an early age because of asbestos yes i remember them they were compensated a penny for it and i've never asked for compensation and i've never i've never worried about it because i thought well i have been breathing all these years and with no affect so i'm fortunate and with regard to convoys and stuff what did you know about the work that you were doing about keeping convoys going not a lot really no we didn't know a lot we didn't get a lot of information except what we read in the papers you know we just did our daily work you know cos' i had to we had to join the home guard so very often it was a matter of coming home from work and going out to the home guard yes which was on beety avenue where we had a place it was beety avenue where we used to sleep at night then we'd be called out they called it the z batteries and they were rockets and you loaded the rockets and fired at night you know and there were there was two projectors and you had to load them onto a projector which had two and you was given the elevation and that over the phone and you did that and then they would give you the word fire and you'd pull the lever and these two rockets went up from each side and there was about there was about must have been fifty of these z battery rockets on one field on beety avenue if i remember and you was firing at the aircraft and you'd hear them but you could never see them cos' it was at night mostly and during the day the batteries were made by regular soldiers you know and the home guard would do it in the evening yes hear any i never heard of any no to tell you the truth i never heard them we'd actually made a hit it was yes so there was two people on each one and you'd get the the rocket was in bunks a number of them and you would draw one out ooh they were heavy yes that big yes they were heavy too and i think they were t and t and they were heavy and you'd run and pick one up and load it onto the rocket and there'd be two the rocket and you would hear over the phone what elevation you had to set the rocket to or the shell to or rocket whatever you like to call it you'd do that and then you'd hear the elevation and that over the phone and then they'd say fire and you'd press down and these two went up there was a number of them on the field there must have been well it's a job to say now after all this time but quite a number and the town's people used to say they made a terrific noise when they went off you know when they were all fired at the same time and not a lot not a lot there must have been great celebrations yes i can't remember a lot about it to tell the truth oh cos' we had home guard uniforms and we were allowed to keep that and i used to wear the trousers to work for ages and ages i wore those home guard trousers dirty job boiler making was yes can i ask you a question about pembroke house can i ask you about pembroke house yes how do you find living here in pembroke house one of the best places you could be really yes its uh yes i didn't really imagine that i would be here but it's the best the best that you can i think well its the uh caring i think is the thing yes pembroke house and i remember it of course when it was a girls it was a naval children girls it was a girls home pembroke house was when i was a boy and i remember the girls being in their little sailors uniform it was yes it was true that's what pembroke house was it was for children girls mostly girls who's fathers had been killed or some reason or other you know that's what they were the girls yeah pembroke house was a girls yes a girls home ex naval people's children yes the people you mean the carers very good very good couldn't wish for a better place really no no very good they umm yes i couldn't be in a better place i feel at the end of my life because they are caring and err i couldn't be in a better place now yes and my daughters my daughter my son are glad that i'm here because they know that i'm being taken care of yes my daughter is able to come very very frequently because she lives not far from here yes right opposite it's the park isn't it jennifer park i i have walked to my daughter's mind you they got onto me because i i went out of the building and i went along into the park and through the park out the other gate and along seeton road and up cleve road to my son in law my daughter's house sixty four cleve road i think it's sixty four and they nearly had a fit when they come to the door and i was there so anyhow they got me back no they phoned up first and told told them here that i was there and that they were going to bring me back yes
 my name's irene bellamy irene just where are you from i was from bristol from the fishponds area where i was born and i went to school in bristol and started my work after school in bristol how old were you when war broke out umm well i was born in nineteen nineteen so i was twenty what was life like for you in bristol i mean just tell me a bit about your schooling and just life in bristol so i understand who you are umm i originally went to a small private school umm and then went to coleston from there and umm it bristol itself i found rather dull you know it was all pubs and churches that's how it seemed to me you know there weren't the lovely fun things that there are for young people today we spent most of our time either going to our free time going to the cinema or playing some kind of games you know i belonged to various hockey teams and tennis clubs and umm during the war umm of course we worked very long hours umm and late so you weren't looking for much leisure fun and i moved because of the bristol blitz during that time umm i was put up by the firm they didn't want us in the danger of central bristol and so on and so they took over a cottage in chipping sodbury and i lived in chipping sodbury for a couple of years that was quite good fun actually the sort of village life lots going on but i'd always had a yearning to go into the navy when the war broke out mainly cause i had friends who had joined the services was it was it wrns over any other service yeah i didn't want to join do you mean err waaf or ats or anything no no no my particular friend went into the waaf and she had a very interesting time as out in washington err working for the naval not naval the air force the wrns was the right choice then yes yes liked the uniform too yeah just tell me a bit about yate and what you were doing there and the the work and stuff umm well as secretary to the chief designer in the beginning it was a question of doing typing he would dictate his design umm reports cause it all had to go up to the air ministry for approval err cause they were looking for a umm an order for these planes of course and it was typing all these sheets of description of these planes umm and that i mean to say he was a very un disciplined man in that he left everything to the last minute so one was working quite late at night very often to get it done to the deadline that the ministry had set what was his name basil henderson and he designed the small plane called the umm what did they call it umm the hendy it was a breakdown of his name but it was basil hen it'll come to me but it was round about the time that there was umm another chap designing those small planes umm i can't think of his name now but that would have been in about nineteen thirty seven thirty eight did you have a sense that war was coming umm not really no i mean to say the boys that we used to meet and mix with were mostly umm air force types or going interested in the air force and we knew they it was the five hundred and one squadron the at filton umm that most of them flew with umm and we knew at times that from their conversation that things were getting very near but umm not really you know we weren't putting up the barricades or anything what about the outbreak of war do you remember that i do we were actually on filton aerodrome when it that sunday when they announced it watching these lads in their planes taking off purely for exercise so did things change in bristol when war broke out what was the change do you remember i can't honestly say because most of my life was spent between fishponds and yate you know i very rarely went the other way towards town and didn't really get any feeling of what things were like even you know i read now about some of the ghastly things that happened in the bombing you know the loss of life but it didn't affect me directly umm my parents had a shop in fishponds and they still kept going you know in a quiet sort of way what is said did you see the blitz did you see were you in were you in yate when it happened yeas i was in yate yeah and that was one of the reasons why the firm moved us to live in yate so we didn't have the business of travelling umm but we did have a daylight raid in yate and that was very traumatic there was they sent a single plane i mean we were all working away quite happily and the air raid siren went and err i was being taught how to play bridge by the friend who went into the air force and umm we didn't take any notice of the air raid siren because we never had anything and suddenly there was the most almighty explosion and the whole building shook what had happened a single plane had come in apparently it came in from somewhere in the northern france area where the german's had umm airports and it had flown up the bristol channel to somewhere north of gloucester picked up the railway line and yate runs along the railway line you know the building and flew down and dropped this strip of bombs along the factory fortunately a couple of them didn't go off and i think it was about fifty seven people were killed and it was my first experience of seeing a dead body because i knew most of the people in the factory because of who i was working for and one of the other people living in the house in chipping sodbury was a woman called sister hobbs who became quite well known for the work she did in that blitz and she just caught hold of me and she said come on we've got to go up to the brick factory' she said to identify these people who've been killed and you know i was taken but also i it was nineteen forty one so i was twenty two at twenty two to see all these disintegrated bodies and i hadn't seen a dead body before and that was very traumatic yeah was that do you think a catalyst for thinking i want to join become a wrn then no i don't think so no no that was quietly simmering away and i think the catalyst in the end was when my boss moved he went to a firm which again you may know of boosey and hawkes they umm he wasn't a musician or he hadn't made musical instruments cause that was the job they did originally they were making spare parts for some of our gun turrets and they umm found that he was a man who could design what they wanted and umm they got him they head hunted him and when he left i wasn't too happy with the person who got the job and i thought i want to move but i had to work quite hard to get into the wrns because of course i was in a reserved occupation i was going to ask was it a i assumed it was a reserved occupation so you had to go through the procedure to get out yes and there weren't the wrns weren't open for recruitment anyhow and at that time we were being umm drawn i suppose is the word for a the by a war artist a man called leopold freedman who i haven't been able to run to earth since i have tried because he did like a mural of people working in the factory and it went to the umm national art what's the one in trafalgar square national art gallery in trafalgar square umm and i was sitting you know while he was drawing me and talking to him and i said i wanted to join the wrns the problem was there were no vacancies and i was in a reserved occupation so he gave me the name of a woman again i've forgotten her name but she was the head of the ministry of labour in london so i go off to london to see this woman and she told me the sort of inside secret that i ought to be able to get in fairly soon because the wrns were expanding and they expanded very rapidly and i got in very easily then but i had to wait til the doors opened of course the lords of the admiralty didn't want women you know they reluctantly took them in at the beginning of the war but you know it was a man's service it wasn't for women brilliant so what was the process then from transitioning from being a secretary in yate to becoming a wren what do you remember of it yeah i remember err you know having my papers and being sent to leeds because because they suddenly expanded err they had to open new training depots i was in my early twenties and umm i had what they call a white paper umm which was a recommendation for a commission as soon as you were interviewed originally you know most girls have to wait and work a while but i was older and i think they saw me as a possible admin officer well they did actually but then i went from leeds after i did my basic training to rochester which is really in the chatham now i had seen myself as boats crew you know because i was a bristolian i wanted to go to plymouth which was the uh but the navy had other ideas so they sent me to be to go to training for an admin officer at chatham really anyhow i they put me in what's called the regulating office which is you know where you monitor people coming in and going out and telephones and umm i always remember that the first officer who was the one in charge was a very very jolly woman umm and she was the daughter of somebody called lady burtonshaw who lived in hove and every saturday afternoon lady burtonshaw would ring up her daughter just for a chat and i was put on the telephone well i'd never never worked at a you know those plug in telephones i'd never worked one of those and of course lady burtonshaw comes through and i was a panic you know i wasn't very confident about it of course what do i do in the very middle of their conversation i pull the plug out you see so i had to go in she called me in and she said who was on the telephone' so i said' it was me ma'am' so she said you are nothing but a broken reed' and i thought well nobody's ever called me a broken reed before but you know it did me the world of good i thought i was god's gift to the navy you see and i wasn't at all but that remark really has stuck with me all my life what is said were you excuse me for asking were you a chatham rating yes okay i suppose i was nor command it was did you go to chatham well not only in sort of to visit because we were billeted in rochester and because i was doing the admin work in the office the office was attached to the billet how did you find moving round the country had you been out of bristol at this point umm i not very far no that was another thing you didn't travel far you know holidays were well the furthest we went was tenby in south wales but i had been to london umm and i had been to france on a school trip umm once but no not very far we weren't very well off anyhow as a family you know we had to cut our corners so after rochester then where did you where did you go then well when i was at rochester the first officer i was telling you called me a broken reed' umm i was in the what do they call it now sort of the office which allocated postings to the girls cause all the girls there were waiting to be sent somewhere umm and i was there and nothing came in cause i was looking through all the different things that came in from the admiralty and nothing came in i was interested in i was down for admin and then i found that to do admin i had to go to umm lowestoft to the captain's office where they trained admin officers and i found that there was a long waiting list and i thought well i didn't join the navy to sit in an office and wait for that' so i was given the opportunity to go and i said no so they said well you realise you'll go to the bottom of the list' i said well i didn't join to have a commission anyhow you know i joined to do a job' so she said to me if you see anything coming through umm it was a teleprinter in those days let me know and i'll see i said well all i know is i don't want to work in london i don't mind where else i go and you know i'd like to stick with my shorthand and sort of general office work okay she said so in comes it was at the time when general eisenhower was umm getting to be quite well known as a commander and he set up if you remember shaef and i looked it and i something came in with ancxf shaef and i thought well that's interesting' and at the ancxf was the allied naval commander expeditionary force and that was admiral <PER>ramsey<\PER> and i thought well that sounds interesting' you know so i went to her and i said could i have my name put up for that vacancy and so she agreed and you know you had to take your chance what other applications they had and umm i got it and i said where is it so she said well to start with you'll have to go to norfolk square in london which is the headquarters of shaef and the ancxf group were collecting there umm and they were mostly wrns who were going to do the d day planning but i got because i put in for ancxf shaef i got attached to the this is where admiral parry came in to admiral parry who typically british we hadn't started d day but they were always already post operative planning and i couldn't believe this i thought well we haven't won the war why are they planning for the future you see and that's what i was caught up in then from then on i was attached to him and sent to bushy park in hertfordshire not hertfordshire umm it's near hampton court palace and it was general eisenhower's headquarters for they were collecting all the more administrative people there you know while the troops were being collected around kent and sussex and places sorry it's me nerves you're doing brilliantly it's amazing trust me don't worry umm and i thought oh i don't want to go to london but anyhow in the end they said well you'll only be hold held there until umm and i was only held there a day i remember sitting on the wall outside norfolk house which is where the london group were and told to wait and somebody would pick me up cause from then on it became highly secretive and i was sitting like a lonely wren with my naval case and nothing else and a jeep came zooming round the square and an american stopped by me and he said are you wrn irene ballamy goin' to bushy park ' well i said i don't know where i'm going i've just been told to sit on this wall ' so he said he got me aboard his jeep and we went through that bit it wasn't far from norfolk to get out of london went to bushy park bet that was a fun journey and of course when i get to bushy park i'm the only wren there because it was a separate unit to the big group that were at norfolk house what year was that err be forty four i think fourty fourt fourty five what is said i mean just describe the set up at bushy park and what you were doing there before d day well bushy park umm is i presume it's a sort of local it's a very large park and in it were porta cabins in which by then you'd got the british and the french err and americans who were the fourth ones not the canadians no yes well there were a few but not many i was thinking of the group that they split germany up into regions didn't they there was the british russian russian but i can't remember russians being at bushy park i think they linked up later umm but i remember being in one of these we had our office and this is where i didn't actually couldn't say i met him but the doodlebugs had started flying and umm we they'd got they had bushy park in their sights and they got very near us but so there were air raid shelters built specially and a lot of the americans particularly the women in the american army had never experienced anything like it before they just went to pieces if there was an air raid they were a terribly nervous lot but i quite enjoyed being with them because it was a different lifestyle altogether their method and the equipment they gave us you know and the hygiene was put in so i was really i was under air umm ats supervision err and somebody called lady brecknock i think she became quite a power in the land afterwards from a political point of view but she was in charge of us and she and i resented her because she she used to open my post which of course the navy never opened your post but because i was under ats rule all our post was opened umm and lady brecknock always made a point of reading and remembering what was in them and i was always sending home for money and err she was always saying you know you don't need money you've got plenty you know you should manage on what you've got ' and that was seven and six a week so from there did you meet eisenhower well yes and no i was talking about the doodlebugs umm and if he was on sight umm in his office he didn't come very often cause of course the his responsibility was enormous and the places you know people said oh eisenhower was there' but they were never there for long umm but he did use the air raid shelter which was the same shelter that we used because we were in the joining offices umm but you know he hardly saw us because he'd pop down and all his entourage would be with him err but i mean to say we didn't feel we were lesser than him you know he always had a word to say but you can't really say you met him you know when did admiral parry come onto the scene umm not actually until i went across to france because in the mean time his one of his sidekicks was a captain owen who had been the portuguese umm it wasn't an attache the naval representative in lisbon umm and so when he joined us on the staff of admiral parry i was attached to him and he always called me his minina do you know i've never actually spoken to a portuguese to find out i was told it meant friend but i was always thinking he always told people if they wanted something go and ask my minina ' but he was a very gentle very nice man who about whom i knew never heard much about him at all i know admiral parry umm at the end of the war umm i think he he was an apple grower in kent and that's what in his retirement that's what he did but captain owen i never knew what did you sense what did you know about this escalation towards d day how sort of privy to it were you oh absolutely because you know although i wasn't in the typing pool as it was umm i knew i'd seen papers going through and you knew what the planning was and you say it was top secret what just describe the secrecy process what did you have to do in order to be let in well it was umm bigot british invasion of german occupied was the third level which was the absolutely i don't think we could ever get through but there were special lines and things on the telephone and it was mostly for use by telephone but i never really knew how they decided umm i knew when i had to if i had to make a call which line i had to use whether it was the ordinary one the top secret or bigot but i never knew when say captain owen was wanting me to do something and he said that'll be bigot' how he knew it had to be bigot you know that was something known to him is bigot above top secret yes just describe what your job was what were you actually doing predominantly i was in london wasn't i well mainly doing the admiral's or captain owen whichever one was around doing the umm their post and taking dictation and what planning they had to do in terms of post op most of the post operative stuff was the division of the german navy when the war was over you know who was going to have what and that was interesting because of course the russians wanted everything this was much further on when we were in berlin but the russians always wanted all the big stuff you know and we knew all the best equipment was in the smaller destroyers and things so umm we went for those so you know they were working out all those sort of things and of course it all had to go up through the admiralty and back again so it all took time but it was just straightforward short hand reporting of the post operative planning even before d day yeah did you ever meet any you know were there any other like churchill any of the other big wigs never saw churchill montgomery umm when we were in germany it was the fashion to have a dog i never had one but umm my friend had one which she called frat cause that of course was no fraternisation and i remember we we had an office we were in frankfurt at the time and the office there had a sort of staircase going up and paddy always took frat to work with her nobody minded cause the war was over by then and err we were going upstairs one day and somebody said watch out montgomery's coming' and he was in the building at some meeting and he was coming again with his entourage down the stairs as we were going up you see and umm apparently he didn't do it in front of us but umm when he got back to his office he told his adjutant to contact whoever was responsible for the wrens to say he didn't want dogs in the building typical so if you were very privy to all this stuff when did you know it was going to be june fifth or sixth did you know that umm well yes because you know of the delay do you mean d day yeah because of the delay with you know yeah so you knew that that this was going to be the day that the landings were happening did you ever yes well it was you did and you didn't you know there were always things being said to put you off so that you weren't a hundred percent sure but i don't suppose anybody was really because of the weather and things but we were when i was at chatham and there wasn't you know we'd done all the work we had to do that we were waiting umm we were sent cherry picking in the kent orchards and that was amazing because all the lanes and roads all round sort of kent and the sort of area going down to the coast were full of army vehicles and men waiting you knew that they were there ready to go but i think that's how i know rather than through the office so after bushy park you went back to chatham did you or back over to bushy park i've got to get this cause i did so many things umm no from bushy park umm we were moved back to london and i worked in princes gardens there and we lived in england's lane in in sort of england's lane it's sort of swiss cottage way and there was a nurses' home there i think it was the cherry cross nurses' home and they used that for wrn billet and then we used to travel to princes gardens from there and it was from princes gardens that i was drafted over to france can you remember how you felt when you found out you'd be going following the expedition i was a bit disappointed cause i felt that my i am still that my naval life was anything but navy you know cause i had great great ideas of being boats crew as i said and going to sea with the mail so i was a bit disappointed that it was going to be in land as it were but once i'd got used to it and there was a certain adventure as well in going over did you sail to france we went over you know those umm boats they took the troops over in the we went over actually umm when it came to it the war was the army was almost in berlin by then so they felt it was safe to put the girls over and we went across to a little town in normandy called granville on the umm well ducks we called them you know duk those like landing craft and i was terribly sick i may say it proved to me i wasn't a sailor anyway describe the sort of the day that you went on the landing crafts to france just going back a little bit on the story and what you remember of you know that day where did you sail from and what was the weather like etc can you remember yes the weather wasn't too good hence the fact that i was sick umm i suppose i think there were probably nearly between fifty and a hundred of us going not only wrns but others umm trying to think we went from one of the little ports they weren't really ports they were around the beaulieu river that way umm we were excited we didn't you know you had all sorts of imaginations of what might happen crossing the channel might sink you know and you'd be able to swim far enough and you know we didn't have to go through water when we got the other side like you see the men you know trailing out with all their stuff through water they managed to beach us so we were quite dry when we got to the other side and you know the french actually in normandy were very accommodating and they were very pleased to see us they were very different in my view to the ones we met in paris what was it obviously war torn oh yes yes you know the umm because it would be after d day of course that we went across so things were still pretty umm broken you know and all the sort of front line houses and things were all bashed about because they'd been bombarded of course from the sea and granville what was the set up there and you you know you're still in a war zone basically aren't you it was a war zone well it was just a sort of getting off point for moving people on behind the army i think it was felt to be a reasonable place to start moving cause we had a lot of equipment as well we didn't but the army and the air force and the navy for that matter all had equipment to move up with us and i think granville probably as a little town was considered you know they had umm good roads not good but the transport situation moving stuff was reasonable but very basic living conditions you know we had no running water or umm we had sort of things like your tripod with canvass bags in them which we used as washing err machines well umm for washing what else was there it was like camping really from the living point of view and very little work we had at that time and what were you just writing or did you have teleprinters or anything like that was there any technology oh yes there was a lot of but not in the group i was with you know the actually the first people to go over were the communicators the telephone operators and so on umm and of course they were still the engineers were still fitting up field equipment when they arrived and there were a lot of wrns in that group tremendous number and from granville you know they found the work they wanted me to do was more centred back in london so i was shipped back to london to wait until they'd prepared what we needed or i had to help do that umm and we went then to paris but i went from london from england's lane that was to paris on my own and then i really was i'd not been anywhere on my own before and they i was met when i got to the gare du nord cause i went over on the train by another wren who'd been over and then we were i was billeted and worked in the chateau in umm it's a suburb of paris anyhow and i worked there for a very short time and then the administrative group were following on behind the army and we went from umm paris to frankfurt and umm i didn't enjoy frankfurt very much because umm there wasn't much to do by now you know most of the planning had been done and life became rather sort of there didn't seem to be any point in what we were doing we'd done it all you know so it was a bit of a playground okay was this at the end of the is this after the war yeah now this is the umm troops had entered berlin umm and we were back in paris so it was sort of just as the war was ending and yes it had ended because one of the things that struck me in paris were the fashions you know the most beautiful hats made out of cellophane paper you know sweet papers and things that the women had made they seemed untouched by the war in paris they didn't much like us i don't think i think the germans had given them quite a good time were you with admiral parry then at this point no i met admiral parry when i got to paris and what was he like as a person very quiet you know you didn't really feel you know he could hit anybody let alone kill anybody but umm or even discipline anybody he was always very gentle and and very nice to work for but very clever of course he umm knew what he wanted and what just describe the sort of working relationship what you did for him and what the purpose of you being there was umm do you mean umm you see most of the he he really would have communicated to captain owen most of what he wanted cause he'd be off doing something else umm but so that captain owen was really the person who was giving me work when there was work to be done but admiral parry certainly was very approachable and he mixed with us there was no sort of officers and others everybody mixed and err he's a difficult man to describe really that's nicely described irene you know but the when we were in berlin do you know berlin at all in the lakes in the wannsee the lakes that are on the outskirts well when we were living in what had been the umm japanese embassy in berlin the most beautiful house and it was in that district where the lakes were i always said the wannsee lakes and they would freeze over in the winter cause we had a winter there and you know the admiral would arrange skating parties and you know of course the ice there is so thick because it's so cool that you could have barbeques on the ice and you know that's when life became a bit superficial latterly when there wasn't much work to do you know you really felt you should be somewhere doing some work and how did you get from paris into frankfurt were you on railways or were you in vehicles oh in naval jeeps most of the travelling we did the only thing when i went from frankfurt to berlin i had been home on leave and when i got back it was to find that i don't know why but they couldn't notify me and couldn't get hold of me to let me know that the main party had gone on to berlin and it when i got back to frankfurt i had to go and report to one of the army officers to get transport and when i got there i found a message to say that general eisenhower's chauffeur had married one of our wrns i knew they were very friendly before i went and that he let them have his house in umm near frankfurt for their honeymoon and they were both due back in berlin and they would give me a lift so i went breezing up the autobahn from frankfurt to berlin in general eisenhower's car amazing and what was berlin like what was post war berlin like absolutely devastated yeah that really did shake me when i saw it you know there was almost every building we saw was destroyed and there were these and they weren't necessarily old women but they looked old cause they were all hunched up you know in dark clothes with wheelbarrows clearing the streets working so hard and little food you know they were working with very little strength but umm i must give the germans their due they did work hard to get berlin back did you go to the brandenburg gate or oh yes yes tell me about some of that well that again was more like a tourist trip you know we i've been trying to think what our office in berlin was like and do you know by then of course it was control commission and umm i can't visualise it at all it's an absolute blank in my memory i can remember the wrenery the japanese embassy and i can remember going on the tram from there to the office but i can't remember the office at all and i'm not i was there for nearly a year but umm we went to see the bunker you know where hitler was killed and that was still in you know pretty rough state you know bits of furniture were still there you know it hadn't been tidied up what was your sentiment towards the germans at the time well it was interesting because umm i found them very helpful but then and you know i quite liked them but of course they had a lot to gain from us in the way of food and so on the russians of course were the the problem because i the story goes that the main russian army that took berlin they pulled them back and they replaced them with the sort of third line who were mongolians and they were pretty rough and umm on one occasion coming home from the office a couple very they used to drink an awful lot any booze they could get hold of a couple of very drunk russians started we were walking home from the office in berlin to our digs and umm they started getting their guns out and shooting all over the place and we had to jump in a hedge and after that to keep out of their way and after that they put a fairly strong marine presence on the road you know a sort of guard on the and we weren't allowed to travel on our own so we were pretty okay on transport if we got the tram home we were alright it's if you started walking we had a german cook in the wrenery and he found it difficult to be pleasant to us but he was because of course he he used to collect our used tea bags and take them home and he knew that if he didn't you know treat us all properly he'd get taken off and we'd get someone else and he'd lose out on his bits and pieces he was getting and we also had an interesting maid franzeska who was german not sorry jewish and umm she had had a very bad time she had legitimately become well i say legitimately but it was her boyfriend and not a german or a russian err pregnant and she had this baby in a cellar which she was hiding from because the germans were still looking for jews even after the war and err anyhow it was a russian soldier who actually helped her have her baby in this cellar and you know who really rescued her and then of course the british we were in the british region of course but franzeska used to have lessons in german for us which she was an educated jew what is said so you didn't go to potsdam yes umm the potsdam conference was held while i was in berlin and admiral parry of course had a cause the main purpose of potsdam was to sort of finalise the break up of the german navy umm and i went with captain owen because of course they'd done their work on the navy to contribute to that i didn't go in to the actual meeting hall cause it's quite small actually i was surprised i've been back since and had another look at it you know and i thought yes it is small but i went this time you know because i was driving as well you know so our group umm the captain said if you'd like to go you can go but you won't be able to go into the conference did you know it was a significant moment in history oh yes i think you you knew that yes you know you saw stalin and churchill you know just as though you were a tourist watching you talked a bit earlier about how the navy knew more about the german navy than the russians the russians wanted the carriers the brits wanted the destroyers was there you know just sort of recap on that was there any more of that discussion sort of pre potsdam that you can recall or was it all sort of done and dusted by then no i don't i think they sort of there was another umm admiral miles was someone who appeared on the scene at umm before potsdam and he had a lot to do with the you know sorting out the german navy but umm sorry i've forgotten what your question was now just was there more discussion about oh you know now we've heard about the v two rockets we should be getting those rather than the russians no i think it was all done before hand i don't remember i know there was and i can't remember what the there was supposed to have been an incident when now of course i don't mean churchill i mean atlee because it was at the potsdam conference you know that churchill umm lost his seat and atlee came in and that meant made a change of foreign secretary and it was what was his name now the big man socialist he was atlee's foreign secretary and he is reported to have got umm cross over something at potsdam and banged the table and water you know there were glasses of water which i gather that the russians didn't take very kindly to this man you know who was determined to have his way bang the table the work up until we got to berlin was really quite interesting but once you know the final stamps were being put on the dividing of the city into regions and things like the break up of the navy of the german navy there really wasn't much interesting to do and it did become a sort of almost a playground just tell me about vj day well we were in berlin when vj day was announced and they said there would be a parade towards the brandenburg gate so we went had the day off and went down to see and it was a wonderful display even though it was the end of the war and everybody was a bit tired and fed up the americans put on a great show with what equipment they had and so did the russians were you thrilled that it was the end of the war were we were you thrilled that the war was over then yes i suppose we were really we were all a bit uncertain about what was going to happen you know the war was over and you know there was this devastated city how was it going to recover and you know who was going to see the germans behave themselves you know with little recognition that the russians were really the problem in terms of the future because that was in stalin's day of course yes it was like going any group just going out to see a parade you know when was you demob and just tell me a bit about that oh i did go back to chatham to be demobbed you know i said i wanted to be demobbed and of course they were then planning the break up of all the services and i went back to chatham just to be hand over things that i equipment i'd got that i had to return it was a very uneventful thing my demob and i returned home what were the circumstances around your bem well that again was a bit difficult for me to explain because it was mainly for the work that i did you know the thing that came you know from from the palace just said for zeal and devotion to duty whatever that means yeah but of course it was war time and there was no sort of going to the palace to get your gong or anything you know it just came in the post it must be nice to have but it was quite nice to feel that it was recognised although it wasn't madly interesting or madly responsible you felt you were contributing in some way which is what i wanted to do in the beginning you know it's a great thing to serve your king and country what is said doing your bit yes and how do you reflect on your life as a wren then i think one of the things you know i began to become much more interested in being with people rather than paper as it were and i had a i was looking round for a job and i just found that there was an approved school wanting a secretary and they called them housemistress in bath i didn't want to be in bristol i didn't want to go back to my old job and that's how that was my first step into social work and then my father became very ill and as the unmarried daughter in the family i was expected to be at home and you know i was concerned for both of them because he was a good deal older than mum so i returned i gave up the approved school that i was working at which incidentally the last one was a place called duncroft in middlesex which had been associated with jimmy saville i thought my goodness and then i oh i had before i left duncroft i had got myself a job with bristol children's department which was in the days before the social services as such were formed and i stayed with them til i retired which golly do you know that was twenty nine years ago do you still think about the wrns oh yes it oh the wrns has remained constant because they have a very strong association and that's i gather how you ran me to earth and i've belonged to the local branch since nineteen fifty three i think it was i joined so you're still as proud to be a wrn now as you were when you became one yeah yeah
 my name is john douglas woodward i'm eighty nine years old i was born on the seventh april nineteen twenty four when in the service i had originally joined to be a signaller and they found out i was colour blind so i was automatically transferred to a the a stewarding branch which i didn't want but you had no choice you did what you were told and i got transferred to minesweepers and i was based on the isle of sheppey at queenborough queensland queenborough pier and we had about ten minesweepers there we went out every couple days to sweep any mines that had been dropped by boats in the hope of sinking our supply ships why did you join the navy because i wanted to get in the fight i didn't want to be left behind at the time i was what they call in the reserved occupation i was an apprentice as an electrical engineer and my dad didn't want me to to join up he was in the last war and he would've preferred me to learn a good steady trade but i wanted to go so as soon as i was eighteen i went over from maidstone where our home was i came over to chatham to pembroke barracks and signed up i said i was nineteen but it didn't matter because they just accepted you if you could breathe in and out and move your arms you were physically fit i was told to go home and wait and i'd be contacted and about a week later the envelope came report to chatham barracks on such and such a day i went right through the war without actually seeing the german we had long range fights with them but we never actually saw a german but john you wanted to do your bit but why did you not join the army or the raf i'm not interested in either and it's traditional in my family my father was in the navy so was my grandfather and an uncle my grandfather was on beatty's flagship the lion at the battle of jutland and he didn't come on deck for three days he was in the engineering branch but that's the service i wanted to join so i did and what do you remember of your training it's rather confuse when you're young you don't take things in so easily but from pembroke house pembroke barracks we were all marched down to the a further down the yard where we got fitted out and at that time everyone unless they were an officer wore the same four and a rig with bell bottoms the scarf and the and the a the hat sent up to skegness with another bunch to butlins holiday camp and that became hms royal arthur and i was to start training as a telegraphist signaller and i been doing morse code started on the morse code for about a fortnight then somebody said ooh this lot haven't had a a colour test they'd better have it ' most of them passed but two others and me were all strongly colour blind so you're out if you send the wrong colours when you're signalling it could be a disaster so that's when i was transferred onto minesweepers on the stewarding branch were you disappointed yes nobody liked being on minesweepers we all kept putting in for transfer to something more glamorous destroyers submarines mtb's mgb's but always got turned down you're doing an important job you will stay put ' and that was it how many people on one of these minesweepers how what was the ship the boat like five officers and about twelve to fifteen crew that includes the the engineers or the stoker branch as they call it signalling and and those doing the actual mine detecting when we first started and went out minesweeping it was three days on one day off and we had two seamen standing in the bows with rifles when they saw a mine that was floating by they'd shoot at it hit the holes and blow it up but that was when they started the minesweeping campaign and they the germans when they dropped them had long weights on wires so they just floated below the surface to hit the ship if one of those wires came loose the mime would bob onto the surface and that's one of the things we looked for each time we went out when the germans occupied france they course got right on the coastline and they had big guns and the and they used to pop away at us every time we came out and fortunately we never got hit there was one amusing anecdote our commodore had been a senior captain before the war and he retired of course and he was brought back in and made commodore of the minesweeping fleet he had his twelve minesweepers and we used to go out and do the same thing every day the germans being very meticulous would come out we'll say friday's and tuesday's not only the same day but the same time to lay their mines and then dash back in we went out the following morning each time to pick them up and the skipper got a bit fed up with this and he told the conference of his captains one day he said next time we go sweeping run your trawls out but don't drop any wires ' which is of course contrary to all naval instruction and you could have got a court martial if anything happened but we went through the german minefield as they'd laid it and we got away with it so the germans came out again to replace the mines they thought we'd picked up and they lost four of their own boats on their own mines and i don't think they thought that was very sporting when we went out i was due to report with six other stewards we reported to the first lieutenant we're damage control party if the ship got hit we had to clear the damage away put out any fires and pull the wounded into the war room where the doctor was waiting to do what he could but fortunately it never happened but that was my official station and what about bad weather and storms and stuff did you ever encounter any dangers oh we had some yes but we still went out you just put on your and that was it we had safety lines rigged fore and aft so you hold onto those you wouldn't get washed overboard what was it like watching the planes taking going over you and stuff did you see much activity in the air we went fortunately we never got attacked from the air i don't think the the germans thought our little boats were worth wasting a bomb on they wanted them for the capital cities or the airfields were you involved in d day at all yes now a week before d day the base was shut down like an oyster nobody could go off duty and no one was allowed in for security reasons obviously you couldn't get any post you couldn't make any phone calls because it was coming up although officially we didn't know that and for about three months before d day on admiralty instructions we'd started night sweeping as an alternative to the day shift so the germans would get used to the idea of us popping along the coast during the hours of darkness they wouldn't think anything of it so the early morning of d day we went out at midnight and we were sweeping right up to the line where the battleships were waiting to bombard the coast we knew exactly where they were going to be stationed and we swept that most carefully and then we as they started coming out of the darkness from two o'clock in the morning and waiting and we retired behind them there wasn't anything else for us to do we got sent back here to the the isle of sheppey when the troops went ashore we were a bit annoyed because we weren't doing anything and then about eight or nine days later we got the orders to patrol the dutch coast on the and pick up all the mines which the germans had so liberally round all the coast there so that kept us busy for about three weeks and we were stationed at a little town called terneuzen a very small port but there was a long jetty so we could moor alongside there and in the evenings late afternoon you got shore leave until you were going off again next morning and i've never forgotten the things we saw when we went ashore the germans had got out in a hurry and their their signs were everywhere on the hotel lounge that had been an officers' mess and the signs were still up and they'd blew some of the bridges over the canals as they left and the dutch flooded some of the to stop their heavy traffic getting away and i remember once we went ashore and we all carried the navy raincoat draped over your arm folded in a certain way and the officer watching you very well with your things in the pockets cigarettes packet of biscuits a tin of jam or whatever which were not supposed to be taken off the ship and we were giving it to the dutch civilians because they were as starved as hell and looked very ill and on this occasion we got ashore and i i saw a very thin haggard looking woman coming up the street pushing her battered pram and she got two little kids in there about three or a bit less i suppose and one blanket cover them and i good day ' and she gave me a smile she couldn't speak english and i couldn't speak dutch but i took out what i had and i put it in her pram you should've seen the look on her face she must've thought it was christmas come twice because what they didn't eat they could always trade for something else after we got rid of most of the mines off the dutch coast we had a week's leave due well obviously we weren't coming back here for it it would be on the dutch coast and i and another fellow we got along to the main road which was the brussels road leading into into belgium we thumbed lifts from army lorries which were always going up and down and we got into about three three hours no a bit less into bruges which was one of the most beautiful cities i've seen it's got two cathedrals an opera house and the town hall round four sides of the main square and the one of the hotels had been taken over as a for the troops bed and breakfast so we stayed there and we enjoyed ourselves and when we came back we got ordered back to this country and we were still looking for mines which might have escaped detection be going up and down but there wasn't much urgency in it anymore and i did put in an application to sit for leading steward but before that could take place my discharge papers came through and that was in the early early nineteen forty six after the war yeah but unlike the army or the air force we got plenty of notice when it was coming i know people in the air force and they were given three days' notice and then they were out but in the navy we had time you were told you would be demobbed in three months well that gives you time to start looking round for a civilian job or somewhere to live if you're married with kids so i think we had a better deal can you explain you you talk about this minesweeping just explain what you were doing and what happens to these mines well they looked like yard zips from the main masts stretched out either side about fifty feet and from these are very sharp cutting wires with weights on the end and as you go to the water the idea is to your cutting wires to catch the mooring wires for a mine and you cut it and the mine comes to the surface and you dispose of it how many mines would you find on an average day on an average day possibly a dozen possibly only two it varied and the disposal would be a shot would it or that's what it started with yes then the germans eventually the acoustic mine which wasn't it was just dropped in the channel hopefully in the path of oncoming ships and it emitted a magnetic field from batteries that were inside and every ship as it goes also makes a magnetic field and when the two collide the mine goes up so we had to have what was called degaussing equipment a special coil fitted right round the ship allowing currents to pass through that anticlockwise and that nullifies the effect of the electronic field and you could go over mines and you'd be alright could you find those mines we found them yes how sometimes the germans got crass and they dropped some of these mines at night from low flying planes and we got back i wasn't there i was at on a couple days leave and i went home to maidstone but i was told our squadron came back from patrol and the last ship in slid into its place on the jetty and promptly blew up because there was a mine underneath been dropped by a plane and the skipper at this last boat as a result of being six feet from the jetty he got his degaussing equipment switched off i think there was two survivors but who they were i don't know but how would you find i can understand how you could find a mine that was floating in the water you cut it and it floats to the surface how did you find those magnetic mines were they on the bottom or they're on the bottom yes how would you find that well with like a sonar device it picks up the radiations from the mine and you can see exactly where it is and then you can drop a depth charge on it you set the depth charge for twenty feet or thirty whatever it is and just pop them over to the side on a y gun in holland when you got to holland you talked a little bit about what you saw are there any other memories of just the devastation when the germans got out in a hurry they took everyone with them alive or dead and blew a couple of bridges and then retreated towards belgium did you feel like you were winning the war at that stage yes the great day had come the invasion had started and we were pushing in land from the beaches we hadn't been shucked back off again and it was starting to to bite when you were pulled out of d day did you were you were you able to hear what was going on on d day after the battleships have arrived you've come back to base did you were you around long enough to hear about the guns going off the when the main broadside started yes i think that was quarter to six and eight miles of ships all opened up at the same time we already got information from the underground the resistant workers where the german strongpoints were all along the cliff tops heavy gun emplacements bunkers for troops and so on and they got continuous plastering and they hadn't quite finished it was a two hour bombardment and half an hour before it stopped the boats were going ashore with the troops did you hear it we were on the minesweepers behind them we heard it alright it was such a deafening crescendo of noise there's nothing like it you weren't even near it no do you remember ve day oh that was again marvellous i was awaiting demob and of course we got rather more leave once peace was declared and i got i think it was a four day pass to go home to maidstone and we came up on the train to victoria and the place was just one seething mass of people every colour every uniform everything you could think of everyone was singing dancing laughing with complete strangers because they let their hair down and in front of buckingham palace you couldn't got a shoehorn in there were hundreds of thousands stretching back down the mall waiting for the king queen and winston to come on the balcony and the roar that went out must've gone on for about ten fifteen minutes non stop how do you reflect on your navy service now i'm glad i'm glad i went means i and thousands of others don't have to read about history we were making it we were part of that history and i think it's something to be proud of are there any other stories you want to share i don't think there's any no as i say minesweeping is a very dull occupation with occasional short periods of activity but unlike destroyers or battleships you you're not engaged permanently with the opposite number were there any occasions where you were engaged no we were never attacked by planes as i said and we didn't see any german troops the only contact we had was when their long range guns on the french coast tried to get us while we were minesweeping but they they didn't what is said
 i served from nineteen forty one to nineteen forty five basically western approaches that includes plymouth right the way up to the top of scotland and what's your name joan field i was joan rose where are you from and what are the circumstances to you joining the wrns i was actually born in cambridgeshire at a little village called meldreth in i think it was fiftieth century thatched cottage which was my grandmothers small holding i was born there and my parents worked on the small holding in nineteen thirty four we moved to a new town of <LOC>welwyn<\LOC> <LOC>garden<\LOC> <LOC>city<\LOC> where my father then got employment and i lived there and went to school there and won a scholarship and a bursary to high school which is in <LOC>welwyn<\LOC> <LOC>garden<\LOC> <LOC>city<\LOC> and i'm matriculated at which was then a school of matriculation i was then seventeen and i wanted to join the war had broken out by then obviously i wanted to join the wrns i went down i thought i'll hopefully get in the wrns if not i'll have to go into the waaf but they accepted me into the wrns at the time they were only taking on cooks and stewards which of course i did not want to do i did an eye test and they decided i had perfect eye sight then and i was told i was going to be a signaller it didn't mean much to me but i didn't mind what it was and i was called up just a month before christmas to hms cabbala which is up in warrington what year was that i'm just trying to think nineteen forty one in the middle of nineteen forty one and i thought this is marvelous all the officers at christmas were waiting this is a lovely idea but of course that was short lived it was very tough at cabbala you were given two weeks what they call probabtion and you were given all the dirty jobs to do in overalls scrubbing the floors cleaning the loos it was make or break time really squad drill and squad drill you hated squad drill but i got to love it after that but that's another story at the end of the fortnight we were accepted some of them went home and some of them went awol if you went awol then you just went into munitions or what have you but if you didn't really like it then perhaps the waaf would have had you we were first choice in those days everyone wanted to go in the wrns and so i started my visual signaling and coding i did some coding as well but basically visual signaling and the course lasted i think six months yes it was about six months no four months i think and after that time you went on leave and then you were drafted to different places we all of course put down for plymouth all wanted to come south because i lived then in welwyn garden city obviously so it was south i wanted i ended up in oban i never even heard of it i had to find it on the map when i got the draft i didn't even know where it was i found it and i thought this is lovely it will be lovely up there' can i just go back a bit you sounded like you were emphatic about wanting to join the wrns over any other service why i don't know i got no naval all my father and grandfather all served in the army i don't know what it was i loved the sea maybe the uniform do you know i don't really know but i always wanted to be in the wrns it was just something i think stephanie had the same when you read her book there is an attraction to it i suppose in a way it's a sort of glamour of the wrns now you mentioned cabbala and you mentioned ship visualization and coding but i'd like to know a bit more about what you were learning and how you learnt visualization and what was the process well first of all you got to learn the morse code even at seventeen that was a bit tricky but still you learn the morse code and that is absolutely drummed into you the morse code is it purely repetition yes really and truly and you learn gimmicks to learn it you know f for face you learn all these gimmicky things to remind you it is tough we were all put into classes and the visual signallers classes all began with a v and my class was verity and i can't remember what stephanie's class is but she does mention it in the book the wireless telegraphers classes all began with a w like warspite and the coding classes all began with a c and each course was a different length and we learnt morse code semaphore to signal with flags you know like the old nelson signal which kept changing learning the phonetic alphabet which half way through our course changed so the americans could understand it which annoyed us because why should we have to change after all these years anyway so the phonetic alphabet every class was manned by an ex serving man usually a chief who'd never dealt with women before and some of them were a bit tough a bit tough but we needed it because we were completely raw to it all and we were taught naval discipline and different time watches you know how to read a twenty four hour clock which of course we hadn't started to use then the basics really basics and i found it quite enjoyable it was just like being at school really and what about your wrenery where were you staying what was that like pretty spartan but not too bad it was old nissan huts i think they'd been used by i think she definitely mentions it in her book i think they had been used by the post office they were old nissan huts on this big site at newton just outside warrington and it's obviously now been developed into a big housing estate but it was a very large camp mostly the wrenery but there was also men onboard as well they were learning i think wt but we were obviously being trained to take over some of the signal stations from the men to release them which we learnt afterwards obviously so i got my draft up to oban and when you get a draft how is your communication with your parents and this draft you say oban blimey where's that' how did you get there what did your parents think well a bit staggered with my mother and my father my father took me up to euston station i got this draft just a thing report to i suppose it was patrol police up at euston then i was sent to no i went to kings cross and had to go to euston all this military stuff all in civvies you were only allowed to take a suitcase of cloths one outfit of civvie clothes and then the usual pajamas always pajamas you know the usual sort of things you were going into hospital i suppose but only one set of civilian clothes and to report to this place at one of the stations i think it was kings cross and they took me under their wing and sorted me out and got me onto the train my father saw me off and that was really all that happened i ended up where ever am i going you go miles and miles and of course there was quite a few sailors going up going back of leave and they were all kind to me they all realised what was happening and the train was crowded and i can remember we couldn't sit down anywhere and one of the sailors put me up on top of the rack at the top so i could have a sleep i can always remember that we got to carlisle there was an air raid warning and we had to stay in carlisle siding for about an hour which meant that i had missed my train from carlisle to sterling where i had to change again so that was another problem got to sterling and of course the train to oban had gone so i was stranded the wvs put me up in a hotel or hostel for the night and i went on to oban reported to oban to the officer in charge at oban and was told i was going to the pier signal station in the morning i was going to the pier signal station and in the meantime of course i'd been kitted it out at cabbala we were kitted up but i didn't have any bell bottoms that was essential for a vs wren because it was so cold so i was issued with bell bottoms and the next day went on duty and i thought this is crazy all this sort of business at cabbala and all the strict discipline naval discipline nobody seemed to be bothered up in oban i don't even think they realised there was a war on except for the convoys coming in i liked it i liked scotland stephanie didn't like it if you're reading her book or you've ever read it she just didn't seem to mix in very well with scottish people but i've got a scottish grandfather so i did accept it more and i realise that they're a bit insula they didn't mean to be off putting but they were it's an insular land up in the highlands i don't know whether you know the highlands very well they're a thing unto themselves ok well so just describe a bit about oban what the base was like what your surrounding were like where you slept and then we'll talk about the work well oban first of all i was stationed in what was called the station hotel and the signals station on the pier was only a short walk away and i met up with a girl that was going to work with me she had been there about a week we hadn't yet started getting the convoys in so we were told what was going to happen but the convoys would come in and they'd be in a bay and we had to man it all the time we weren't allowed to go on any boats but that's another story we had to monitor everything coming in and out we also had to look after funny enough the raf had their sunderlands and catalina's up there and they had a call sign which changed every hour and half of them could never ever read it so we used to have to read their code signal for them to send their patrol boat out but that was unbeknown to our base that never had a clue what was going on it was a crazy set up really and the submarines on patrol duty used to come in alongside the pier we had to give them their signals when they went out on patrol but that was mostly what we were doing at the pier signal station but this wasn't adequate enough and ganavan signal station which was right around the corner from where we were was still manned by the men and they also had the new asdics centre opening up just below which was radar on asdic that was still done by the men and the men was going from ganavan and they were going over to lismore and the wrns weren't allowed out there because they were completely alone out there there was no habitation just a few sheep farmers so the wrns weren't allowed out in lismore and that's where the photograph was taken unbeknown to anybody so the ganavan signal station was going to oban and we was going to go there which meant great difficulty because from the station hotel to ganavan was about two or three miles in the middle of the night that's no joke so eventually i was there for about at pier signal station from about i would say about a month before ganavan was opened ganavan signal station was then opened up for the wrns and we took over from the men and we had an intake of more vs wrns so there was now six of us instead of four and we took over ganavan from the men very very spartan when we was at the pier station we were able to have meals in the mess proper meals and when we were on night watch they would do us up sandwiches and when we moved from pier signal station to the ganavan signal station we were stationed at a place called lodge which was very tough going they didn't like watch keepers because they couldn't handle us nearly all the wrenery was writers or wt operators who worked proper watch hours they were nine until five not us we had to do watch keeping hours same as the navy so if we were lucky you would get a hot dinner if you didn't you just got a sardine sandwich so the food was pretty sparse if you read in the book people my friends who read the book say why did you stand it' but i said there was a war on we didn't know any different we had to do it it was our job' the men it was a very very sparse signal station do you want me to describe it to you what is said yes please yeah the signal station itself was right on top of ganavan just by dunollie house which is the house of the lord and lady macdougall i think they were called yes macdougall and it was on their land and it had been built as a look out coast i think originally for the coast guards it was very sparse it was a two tier place you had to reach it but to get to it it was a climb up a cliff almost a sheer cliff a road went below us and this sheer cliff up which we had to carry the oldest lamp batteries which was very heavy and then we had to have a coal fire a because we had to be able to burn any confidential books that we had if any if we had any kind of invasion we had to put the books goodness knows how because they were lead line but that's why we had the fire we had a bunk down below and a signal up top and a balcony all around we had a big ten inch aldis lamps an rt set and it was really just go we were pushed into the deep end and how far could you see from there what was your vista oh we could see where she'd got it right from we could see right the way down to mull over to lismore we had perfect vision of everything that was coming and going why was that such an important stretch of coast line in terms of the convoys and your role there because it was very safe they thought they could come in and if you had a look at a map it is a complete bay and tobermory the escort ships and usually about two or three destroyers dropped the convoy off and went up to tobermory then they would go up the sound of mull if you could visualize that coastline mull almost protects the bay so any ships passing have to go around behind mull they don't realise come in that's another story about the duke of york i think it was a very safe haven they came in they were escorted off from us probably down to gourock into the clyde for unloading or they would mass up ready to go out and the eta of arrival or an expected time of dispatch they were either coming or going and what was the most ships you think you ever saw there i don't know the whole harbour would be full i would say thirty more than that yes thirty most likely and of course you'd have a list and unfortunately you think there might be a straggler but they never came and that was a terrible thing and you wonder what happened to that one we had quite a lot of losses unfortunately not in the bay you know coming and going you'd expect to see a load of ships yes because we'd have a list sent to us which was a confidential list and an expected time of arrival and you'd give them about two or three hours but they never came and you just wonder what happened and they were all manned by mostly merchant men so their morse wasn't very good but now and again you'd get a ship that had a few united states when america came in it was better planned you know the liberty ships came and they were better manned and a little bit overpowering really because they were so shall i say this over clever they used to send morse at the rate of knots thinking that we couldn't answer it and we would send back at the same rate this is why we didn't like the americans very much i'm afraid they tried all sorts of things they tried to come up to our signal station and we couldn't have them in we weren't allowed to have them in we had one or two problems with people coming up shall i go on yeah one night i could hear footsteps coming up and a knock on the door and i thought this voice i didn't know who it was it was a man's voice and we'd already had a wren murder in inveraray a vs wren murdered in inveraray on night watch so we were all we were all taught how to handle a pistol we had to go on the range which was the raf had a range and we were taken onto the range by an instructor and we were taught to fire a pistol and i have very small wrists and i was taught to fire holding my wrist so i could fire with my wrist we also had a rifle up in the signal station it wasn't loaded there was no ammunition in it but the pistols were but this rifle wasn't loaded it was just there as a warning i heard these footsteps and this is perfectly true i heard these footsteps coming up and i said to my oppo i don't like this very much' so this kept knocking on the door and in the end i got this rifle and i thought i can't i knew it wasn't loaded and i thought what am i going to do so i put it up the other way and as this voice came through the thing i lifted it up and was going to clock him on the head with it and he said it's alright joan it's only me' and it was one of the signalman from down below stupid who'd got a date i had changed watches with a girl i shouldn't tell this really he obviously used to come up for a cup of tea at this time and have a cup of tea with her and he thought she was on watch and in the end he could of got himself killed and i would have been quite within my rights because nobody we've got a great big prohibited notice on the door and it never ever came to anything and i never ever reported it because it would of got him into terrible trouble but we were armed but only with a pistol and a rifle with no ammunition because we had a wren in inveraray what were the circumstances of that i don't know i'm afraid all that is a need to know you were never ever told what happened we were just told to be very aware and to take extra precautions and i think stephanie mentions this in her book as well we never ever knew what had happened and i mean we had what we thought was a spy that come down and it was all prohibited land for civilians but this man used to come down and sit on the rocks and wait for the convoys and he had binoculars and a camera and we were not allowed to take photographs of the convoys we could take photographs around our cabin around the thing but not the convoys not allowed to so we reported this man to our headquarters in signals back in station hotel and nothing ever happened about it he just disappeared we never heard whether he was just a local newspaper man or whether he was a kind of spy or whether he was just interested in ships we never heard i'm afraid in those days it was all need to know you were never ever told and just picking up on the americans you were talking about because the americans gave you some hassle yes well they would try to bribe us they wanted to come up the signal station look honey we've got some nylons' or honey we've got bananas onboard you know this sort of thing it was so stupid and childish we took a dislike to them what we didn't like was the way they used to treat their officers complete disrespect they would call them by their first names which we thought was terrible and the captains and all the officers never seemed to take any notice of them and in oban one day shopping and the americans who came onboard came shopping as well and they would like to take us for a cup of coffee and ok fine which they did we took them to the ymca and had a cup of coffee going back some of their officers were coming the other way well we were appalled the way they spoke no saluting hiya hiya cap' i thought this is terrible i can't describe it they were just another world away and they were trying to bribe us with bananas and nylons and we just didn't want to know we thought it was so childish with all this very fast flashing morse you touched on the different methods of communication you had the semaphore you talked about the lamps there so just when do you used different types of communication or is it one specific type in oban in the station always by morse by light or sometime by rt but nearly always the rt we only really used for the asdic station but lamps aldis and all the big ten inch which was very difficult of course to handle you had to go out on the balcony and of course up there the winds were always at gale force and we always had to hoist the cones for the weather every day every day we had to hoist the cones for the convoys to know what the weather was what is said what were the cones the cones were the cone was a shape like that and you hoisted it up for the north wind and down for the south wind very primitive but it gave them some idea where the wind another thing you could tell which way the wind was blowing just look at the ensign which we always had to fly the white ensign and we had to by the colours put it up at sunrise and down at sunset so the ensign was always flying so you could always tell which way the wind was blowing without the cone and if it was a gale force wind we used to put the cone up which sometimes meant the cone was up for days because the gales would blow up there very windy and sometimes we would have to be lashed onto the ten inch by our oppo because it was so windy you kept being blown away it was very very cold and we were always wet but it didn't seem to matter did you have a bath or a shower up there when we went back how long would you be situated up there then well the night watch was a long one we'd go on something like eight o'clock and come off at eight o'clock next morning that was a very long one the other watches was pretty well four hours on four hours off but in the night watch was a tough one you said you had to walk there and back first of all we had to walk we couldn't we objected because the men in the asdic station down below us got transport they were working the same watches well yes ok then they decided they would issue us with bicycles which they did we had a wren officer come up to see us and she said this isn't good enough and then they supplied transport for us so we didn't have to walk the night watch backwards and forwards three or four miles in the pitch dark along a coast road but first of all we had to before they realised what was happening there is a story about the duke of york can you tell me about that the duke of york we never had the big ships the escort ships never really came into us just destroyers or corvettes because they always used to go into mull to wait for the convoys to go back out so we never had anything what i would call large i was on watch with stephanie on this particular occasion and if you can picture the islands and the sea and suddenly you see a great big cross mast coming at you and you thing what an earth is that you had no idea what it could possibly be and we had no eta for anything we had nothing it was moving very slowly it got bigger and bigger we couldn't believe it of course we called it up and there was no reply and of course that was worrying because there was no reply because every hour it changed the call up sign had changed in the code book so you would call them up by the code what it was for the day and no reply so we had a little ship we had two ships actually one was called the southern star and one was called the southern wave and they were patrols ships and they used to patrol backwards and forwards along the convoys all the time they were old something i would call something like a corvette i think they were old trawlers they were manned by navy and they were if any trouble we called them up immediately and we called up the southern star she was way out over mull and we asked her what it was all about and she said i can't see anything from here' because they would be way way she said i'll go and investigate' she said if it's any trouble i'll put a shot across it's bows' and that was that anyway this thing got bigger and bigger eventually i managed to call up obviously the bunting tosser that was visual signallers are called bunting tossers was asleep i should think he thought we're only coasting around these islands and he came back quickly d of y instead of a pennant number because all ships have pennant numbers either the pennant number of the ship of the code but she came back quickly with d of y and i said to stephanie d of y duck of york' i said gosh it's a battleship and base don't know' so we quickly phoned our base and they didn't believe us because nobody had got an eta anyway the captain of our base came rushing down took him about half an hour to get to us by which time she was in full view massive great thing it just filled up the whole of the bay i've never seen anything like it and of course it was a great big who har about this why didn't we know well of course she was on pilgrimage up to norway after the scharnhorst and she was doing this i suppose she though they'd got time i don't know why they did it they were way of course she must have known the way very well because it's very dangerous out there but she did she came right passed us just of mull i mean i can show you exactly where she was on a map she just appeared by the islands as if it was on some kind of film it was incredible and the sort of thing you dream about lovely story nobody ever really again need to know we never really found out but we realised afterwards what it was all about she was on her way up to the battle in norway what is said d day d day came we had all ships we couldn't understand why they looked so dreadful they were all sort of battered ships and we thought we'd seen some awful sites but there was about fifty of them with two destroyers the durban and something else one was the durban and one was something else maybe she mentioned it in the book anyway and we thought gosh the destroyer looks in terrible state surely the navy we had no idea what they were they came in i suppose they came in a week about ten days enough time for stephanie to get to know this signalmen yes it must be ten days we still couldn't understand why they were in such a state and why they didn't because they only ever stayed two or three days but they seemed to be a long time and we thought hello something is going on then all our we were told we were not allowed to post anymore letters all our letters were to be cancelled all our postage out was to be cancelled everything going out from the base was to be stopped and all leave was stopped and we thought something was in the air you know you get that feeling we thought well where they are going what are they going to do and of course they were the block ships the night before d day they didn't know what they were doing they had no idea what it was all about or so they said the night before they all seemed to be getting ready a big ship came alongside some of them and took of a lot of stuff we thought they don't usually unload here it goes to gourock and greenock but they were unloading all sorts of stuff and we watched them through the telescope you know chairs and tables and all sorts of things were coming out and we couldn't understand this next day when we came up on watch they were all busy ready to go out and we had no expected time of departure at all they all just seemed to disappear and our two patrol ships had no idea they said what do we do they're going' we couldn't tell them because it was so secret and that was d day that was the block ships going down they were all rotten old ships that nobody wanted the two destroyers had been so battle scarred that they were almost sinkable so they were the two big block ships and these were sent down to help out and we never ever heard until the end of the war what it was all about these were obviously then the block ships a thing you touched on earlier but i'd like more clarification on is that the convoys essentially you did talk about this documentation so can you just explain again for me you know how the process a dispatch rider would arrive from base from station hotel which was their base a dispatch rider would arrive with a confidential letter which would contain eta of the next convoy coming in so right you'd then get it out put it in front of you and put it up and wait for the first one to come in eta nine am and perhaps they wouldn't start to come in until nine thirty they'd obviously been marked i think from ireland they were then sort of marked across get the eta of them coming across and that was literally how we got the eta from the dispatch rider confidential letter would come i suppose they're every the convoys were coming in quite regularly at least once a month coming in by the time they'd gone out again the bay was nearly always choka block and then of course you've also got the raf boats going backwards and forwards with their sunderland's and catalina's so it was quite a busy little harbour and every single thing had to be logged and logged out identified and put down you know you had to be on watch pretty well aware what was going on all around you literally in the air with the catalina's this why we had to have southern wave and southern star who used to be out they were also signaling and trying to get it was really like a great big heard of sheep and two shepard's trying to keep them in it could have been organised chaos but it wasn't it was very very good it always worked it was just sheparding these ships you know these big liberty ships they were quite big and do these liberty ships have its own call sign which you would yes each we knew each one we had a identification for each one so we could mark them off if not we've got everyone's name the list wasn't very long but yes we had identification for all of them you had to concentrate quite hard when they were coming in you couldn't let your attention wander because you know you've got to be so quick and you talked about some of them not coming how do you feel when you've done five convoys and you're missing twenty boats what was the feeling well first of all when it first happened its' you wonder what happened to those i hope they're alright but by the time you've done it for about a year or so you just except it you know what do you do you don't know what has happened to them you never know what's happened again you've got this need to know we used to try and find out but we were never ever told that three of them probably been sunk off somewhere you think i wonder how far they got and what happened to the men but you know what happened to all that lovely stuff that was coming in or going out i don't know you just don't know you never knew you just had to accept whatever was happening just and leave it put all your sort of personnel feelings aside because it was no good worrying about it because what could you do and what do you remember of ve day ve day i was still on watch on ve day i don't remember much about it because i was up in scotland we were invited to a big parade in edinburgh which we did take part in later on but the big ve parade we thought by the time we get there i mean it's a journey from oban to edinburgh i mean it's you just don't get on your bike and go you've got i don't remember we just had a party that was all we had a party we were never allowed obviously the rum the rum ration but sometimes we used to go on the ships used to come in and we had a tot of rum but i hated it i didn't like it very much of course after the war i was in the royal naval association and i was vice chairman of the branch of the royal naval association and they used to have tots up there always offered me i don't like it it's to hot and to fiery for me so ve day was really just a tot of rum and a knees up in the base and vj day the end of the war totally the end of the war where was i at the end of the war i was out toward point in dunoon because as the convoys were no longer needed we were no longer needed so stephanie went to ireland and i went to toward point dunoon to hms brontosaurus and that was the ships coming back and forth down the clyde and that was where i spent vj day and just another knees up really you can't say much more about it and from there i could either stay in the wrns or i could be demobbed from there which i was demobbed because i wanted to go on a social services course so i already lined up what i wanted to do in a way now i regret now not staying in i think in a way but it happened it didn't work out like that and how do you reflect on it all now many years later i enjoyed it i quite liked it i'm glad i did it it was an experience i'll never have again and nobody will ever have again because it will never happen like that again i enjoyed my time up there i loved the highlands
 my name is joe pitcher my number in the navy is c j x two nine o two one one joe where are you from well i originate from suffolk i was born in suffolk my dad was born in suffolk he was one of three sons and they all joined the navy because work wise in east anglia was not too good when he married my mother wherever he was he tried to get us as children with him i mean i went to school out in malta for two year so what do you remember about the outbreak of war well at that period i mean well as i was saying i was in the church choir i was walking through the village one day it was always surnames with the vicar pitcher he said there's a job going down at halesworth as an apprentice hairdresser if you wish it was a job so i went down and got the job my job obviously at the start i was taught how to shave with the old cutthroat and believe it or not i mean a shave in those days was tuppence and a haircut was four pence well i mean i finally got to shaving the head bloke the head bloke there i was more nervous than he was yer anyway i succeeded okay so let's move on to the war then what do you remember the outbreak of war where were you and did you expect to get into the navy at that point people were saying i mean i was obviously that type of age should be called up and they'd make you a cup of tea and well my sons in the army or in the navy and i was glad when i finally got my calling up papers so you didn't volunteer you were called up no no i was called up and the railway warrant was for afon wen i thought surely not china so i looked it up and it was pwllheli north wales hms glendower and so finally had come the day and i had to turn up at hms glendower what was it like going to glendower then well there was a train journey train journey and cause funnily enough i met in with other lads who were being called up the same day so you got chatting to them i mean every week they'd be a crowd of lads come in and you'd see um come in your now you got your uniform your in the navy and you'd see the train come in and other lads come in and all of them you done your seamanship and then you were allowed a week at home sorry not a week a weekend at home and then back and do gunnery and get drafted to a port which was your port my first port was i'll think of the name of it in a minute hull and again you'd go on a pool report to a certain place i was amazed stepping out of the station at hull the bombing they were quiet heavily bombed so you get on this pool and finally i had the ship a little coaster a collier the hms kenrix hms kenrix i've got a photograph of her here in my bundle hms kenrix and i mean the it was a collier and we were taking coal i mean our object was from goole to poole i mean having got loaded at goole which is like inland from hull you went up the humber a little bit and these trains come along and just tip up and the dust i mean everywhere was saturated with dust it would slide into the hold and suddenly you're full up anyway going down the humber the skipper said to me our main argument said on a little ship coaster they'd be three gunners aboard that's all we had three gunners if you like you can try your gun so i had a blast away i tried to just miss a buoy you know anyway having done that i see the chief engineer below deck he said for god's sake before you fire that gun another time tap on the deck because it's unbelievable the noise down there i didn't appreciate that and there we were at sea convoy you were always in convoy on that east coast because of e boats were quiet frequent you know german e boats we'd pick up escorts and more escorts from the wash they'd come out mtb's come out you know having got in the southend area there's a boat there the convoy sort of sails past this boat and as you come by there's a hailer where you from and where you bound so it's from goole to poole and we had another gunner lower down honestly on deck from this ship and all he'd bring was his toothbrush and what ever and to get through the channel to go through the channel at night because they were at times although we got through alright they were bombing from dover from europe to that coast line i mean at one period one convoy we went into there's a deep sea ships would come all round the coast and join us and suddenly we ran into fog and at that period they were on tacking well that means you know suddenly i was off duty but i was on the deck and we're a little coaster and suddenly i see this whacking great deep sea ship making direct for us and i thought i'm too late to ring the bridge they can't alter course and this is a true story and cause your life boats hang over board as you know on a little coaster you'd have a lifeboat hanging each side and they hit the life boat and the life boat and we lost the lifeboat but we got out of it we had a few days in port there and a new lifeboat fixed did you ever come into contact with any german e boats never never it was still the luck of the draw really but another amusing thing i mean the skipper his wife come down by train and i mean in his cabin he had a four poster bed with the old brass knobs on the bed job you know on the corners and he said gunner he said brass up these knobs once a week and there's sixpence for you it's a laugh now but i mean it was a pint of beer yer anyway this one time going north to get to the humber again why this time the crew were so friendly and all i remember i'm aft on the oregan and you know keeping watch looking round and suddenly two sides of the bridge there was a bloke who was on the wheel and there was a second mate on the other side and they put their hands up and said look no hands i mean its ridiculous i know but we was in convoy yer things like that you know it's a friendly old crew you know very friendly were you ever worried on those convoys because they were attacked quite a lot weren't they they were but never no there was on the next ship i was on how long were you on the kenrix well i mean you were suddenly allowed leave a case it's up to you i mean i could have stayed aboard her but obviously you like to have a leave you know when your entitled to leave you apply and you leave the ship and then come back to that port and you pick another ship up this i did i went home on leave come back and i picked up the cambrian coast another coast boat and she was running from kirkcaldy scotland to london it was quite good i mean cause one day at winter time i was in london for the christmas and up in scotland for the new year och aye friendly old crowd what year was that i can't give you the year well i mean i was called in nineteen forty one so your talking about forty two it'll be nineteen forty two i can't give dates can i ask which port division were you assigned to were you a chatham i was a chatham rating but i never got to chatham you were a chatham rating and that was it never got to chatham no did you ever have any issues with other ratings port ratings or was it did you have a pride to be a chatham rating well i mean my dad was a chatham rating i mean he finished up as a signalman a chief petty officer on one trip we had to on the way going north we had to call into middleborough so we didn't go along side we anchored cause the actual town was quite inland any way we anchored in the harbour there was a harbour there so to get ashore we had to a little liberty boat and i'd never sculled i don't know if you've ever done any sculling in your life they lowered the little boat in to get the chaps ashore and i learnt to scull i didn't go ashore but i was so happy getting lads ashore and picking them up again i thought it was wonderful again by this time again three gunners they'd be three gunners on board again well i had a colleague george he was a londoner and he had a gold tooth and he was quite a lad he was a barrow boy sort of thing he spent his spare time writing out three d a pound pears on a bit of paper type of thing quite a lad so george was a shore so anyway suddenly up anchor and we're away and george is not with us so i thought oh god so i thought oh you should have reported it but i didn't if he's got the sense to come up by train and pick us up you know no body's going to know anything about it if he come up by night well ongoing into port in kirkcaldy the procedure was the gunners helping to take the lifeboats in and as a mate i mean i was the below deck so come on you bloody gunners come up were getting the life boats in where's george so i had to tell the first mate so i said well i'm afraid he's not here hopefully he'll come up tonight he said well we'll leave it but if he comes in nothing no problem but if he don't i've got to inform the skipper he's missing i often thought if we'd been torpedoed on the way up and george i don't know what he'd of done i don't know whether he'd have reported it you know it could have been one of us that had sunk anyway george turned up and he'd got with a young lass he's late whether he stayed with her the night i don't know but any way he came up by train so he were saved again we've now left kirkcaldy heading south suddenly they realise no cook and the cook the skipper said to me cause they'd only be three gunners and i mean we used to have the cook would cater and serve us only a little cabin and a half where we used to eat our meals i mean he'd look after the skipper and mate and the first and second mate and the engineer the first engineer the second engineer the crew looked after themselves they had the use of the cooker you'd fuel it with coal so you couldn't control any heat pitcher he said you'll cook so i had to do the cooking i was doing fine until we hit heavy weather i was seasick any way that was it i got over it we survived yer what was the galley like on something like that well it was just i mean a cook was a professional cook he was a good cook well he got his stores but i don't know whether he was suppin' up on shore or what but you'd have thought they'd have checked before all hands on board nothing though and away we went how did you personally feel leaving a ship when you'd had a nice time with the crew oh horrible because you got to make new friends and get used to other people it is horrible well you couldn't imagine that because i mean life at sea wasn't all that happy really you was tense a lot of the time yep is it recording now or not yes i mean from that aspect but well as i say there's quite a story here really i wasn't the only one on this first trip on a silverstone can i ask what did you think of the silverstone when you first saw her well i mean are we recording well my first i done my watch my quarters were aft we had a four inch an old four inch gun aft from the last war and i saw a rat well i'm a country lad you don't keep rats i told um which is probably why they didn't take to me i said come on rats you don't want rats oh that's joey we feed him i said well i don't feed rats i went and got a trap off the mate baited it caught it and killed it so that was the end of that so whether they took a liking i don't know can i just ask as well i mean most of your sea ship seamanship now is being coastal how did you feel going out to deep sea west well it was quite an experience really i mean obviously the old atlantic is a bit tricky but well i mean every day you get the old sunderland and come and circle the convoy be flashing of lights and contact and all of that and we'd say they're away home again they'd be home at their own base at night anyway we finally come in through this harbour so i can't think of the name of the harbour anyway nova scotia there's an island there there was a harbour finish all guns you can unload your guns and that's it so we'd all unloaded ours back in the mess and brewing up having a cup of tea well suddenly this lad who you know it was his first trip to sea i think he come in with a marlin gun i think he had well with a marlin gun the trigger i think it was used in aircraft as well was a sort l' shaped job and then you fired it well we're all sitting round supping our coffee and he flung it on to the mess table i can't unload the bloody thing prittttt the tracer round the mess honestly the tracers and the armour piercing through the ships side we're all down on the deck well of course there is that one blast and we're all down and they stop it the triggers released the mere fact of hitting it on the deck hitting it on the edge of the mess table started it so it was the luck of the draw you know nobody didn't tell the skipper or nothing like that i mean he's one of forecast you can't handle a bloody gun do you no that was that and the other thing on the same trip my first trip on her when i was off duty i walked round the deck i mean your off duty you can do as you wish if you don't want to sleep i saw this hose and i thought oh the weather was warm what about a shower and i saw this stop cock and i had a little go and nothing and i suppose i'd switched it off i don't know any way one of the things i didn't know at the time that was the magazine for all our four inch guns to fire it you push your shell in ram it home and then you put a cordite in a silk bag in and then a sparky was to fire it well they come aboard to see if we'd had any action which we hadn't and examined it you know where's your ammo where's your ammunition in the locker i'd flooded the locker please don't say anything i did say please sir i did it so i kept quiet but i mean no problem took it all ashore and dried it out the cordites in silk bags you can dry it out it's one of those things but that was i should have reported it i suppose i didn't know you see i mean there should have been a lock on the thing but there wasn't so i done wrong there anyway we had a trip ashore we was allowed one trip ashore at montreal it was montreal wasn't it well we had a trip ashore and the lights were all on it was lovely we done shopping for the girls i mean well you know we were all lads twenty twenty one twenty two the bloods rising type of thing and well we'd got a girlfriend at home you know could you just put that dress on and what ever and put that brassiere on have a twirl round and we did all this they fell in it was lovely it was great anyway that was it and then we went down further and picked up wheat from another port and away out to sea again i mean they tell me the lawrence freezes up in the winter and we were praying there was going to be a heavy frost but no we was out back to sea again out to sea again anyway finally we come in to north shields with the cargo this cargo of wheat i mean we had tanks which they welded to the top deck and that's where you ride there well i didn't get on to well with the i couldn't somehow i wasn't part of it i don't know whether its cause i killed their rat i don't know i wasn't getting on too well with the crew so i thought well i did have a problem with the a wisdom tooth so i thought well i'll go sick and get off so that was it and what a do the wisdom tooth when you say you weren't getting on very well with your crew i mean how does that manifest itself on a ship for somebody who doesn't know what life is like on a ship how did you feel why did you feel that way well it's a funny feeling i mean it's rather suppose like a marriage that's gone wrong you'd like to get out rid of it really i wish i could i did have problems with my wisdom tooth well i thought i'd use that to get off the ship but funnily enough having said that that ship was clobbered on the next what i'm thinking i've lead a very well a fortunate life i suppose i survived and that ship was sunk and i've got all the details here was sunk the next trip what was it like to get on to a new ship well lovely because everything was brand new everything was brand new so yes so from that aspect what was your mess like ah well just an ordinary mess we slept in bunks it wasn't hammocks you slept in bunks so you were reasonably comfortable quite comfortable where was that sailing then well i well remember i mean we actually loaded and we didn't know where we were going but we loaded at leith come out of the tyne yes the tyne to leith travelling north to load and that was a sort of a general sort of cargo and cause it turned out to be the torch effort by algiers where the yanks and the british went into algiers casablanca and iran so er what is said so what was your cargo do you know general cargo i mean they'll be guns we took guns aboard and general naffi stores general cargo did you have any sense that this was a different convoy well we just didn't know we were not told anything on that score so we just accepted it it wasn't till we got sort of down nearer the meddy that we knew we was involved somewhere in the mediterranean so i mean that first trip we got through got into port and discharged our cargo and away back we went back to newport in wales to another cargo and away we went to sea again and we knew then we were going back to algiers again can i ask you about algiers because it was quite a big convoy wasn't it well it was i mean when we finally when we finally went through the straits of gib well initially before we went through the straits we were actually bombed with a high level bomber coming over it was so high but i mean our guns couldn't touch it but we had on the deck a we had a rescue launch which we had ex pilots who i don't know whether they'd lost their nerve or what but they were going to crew these rescue craft if any ship was in problems in the mediterranean that was the idea well they said after the trip i may even have got a bucket out there with if you wanted a drop of rum you had a sip which they did well i said well you know well they said we were used to dropping bombs we're not used to being here where they are coming down so anyway that was that anyway we finally got through bigger escorts come out of gib we had a destroyer and i think we had a cruiser with us oh you think well we're safe here now cause the other trip went ok but no we weren't we were torpedoed we got a hit for'ard and um well immediately i mean having been hit the hatch covers are blown up in the air there are bits of timber which covers the hatch well as one come down one of the long bits of wood it landed on a wire which ran from the funnel to the bridge well that sets off the siren well a long blast on the siren is abandon ship well well i mean we weren't sinking although we were well listed the skipper immediately left the convoy and started making for the shore this would be more or less opposite oran we were sort of a nights trip from algiers where we were making for so panic aboard no i mean these lads come up from the engine room with all their little suitcases trying to clamber well they couldn't we were listing well they were trying to get in the lifeboats well the ship wasn't sinking so we had to get rifles out to get um come on get back down below deck we're alright we're safe we're going we're still under way so that was it who were these people below they were mostly indians they weren't english they weren't english they i don't know about the engineer whether he was he wasn't coming up i don't know what he was doing he didn't know how to handle it really well who did when your hit you don't quite know um i mean suddenly there's a list in as much all as you could see the cargo and guns and everything just sliding into the mediterranean it's clear water you could actually see the stuff just floating it cleared that hold out entirely a corvette left the convoy and escorted us cause guns were useless we listed too much we couldn't use anything but we weren't attacked on the coast i was thinking i'm wondering whether that coastline would be mines but anyway we made algiers having got in being listed we tied up alongside in algiers and the army was now established ashore and they would come in to discharge the ship you know handle the derricks and everything and discharge well we got friendly with them and you know we used to feed them because they'd come aboard we had plenty of food aboard and on this particular morning where's old so and so this morning and course he has his well he got stopped at the gates on the way out last night and he had thirteen pair of pants on obviously he saw to flog them on shore i suppose i don't know i mean we had naffi stores we had all that type of thing we had everything aboard there yer where exactly were you when the torpedo hit what was your first reaction well panic really i mean what do you do the noise is deafening immediately it takes a list well i mean once you start to list the waters pouring in that hole obviously the cargo is going out so i mean having said there's a list you could still it's like walking up a hill but we were still afloat you were very lucky to be we were lucky we were lucky well i mean having got in harbour i was telling the story there well finally having the army lads discharge this cargo we then got in another part of the harbour and um i mean most of us was allowed ashore we went ashore and everything well then we had a bombing raid in the harbour and i think i think the ship that was in there as well i think that was what they were after hms sussex i'm not sure but i think that's what it was a cruiser anyway well they missed her and hit us and we got hit the same exactly the same and she just broke up in the harbour she just sunk in the harbour and nobody was killed i mean a lot of us was ashore but i mean with the commotion we got back and i think the skipper told quite a story i think he was having a shower or something i don't know quite what happened there but anyway nobody was killed what is said it's interesting because you know you've had a pretty inoffensive war really until you got to gibraltar you've been torpedoed and you've been bombed how were you reacting to real war situations now can you remember well i think it comes automatic i think it comes automatic i mean we'd seen other ships sunk i mean at sea suddenly you'd see a destroyer i mean we were always in convoy you'd see a destroyer put a i think they used to put a black flag up and they'd come through the convoy just dropping depth charges and i mean in fact i well remember one convoy the ship broke down a lot of old ships some of the old ships merchant ships were very old and it broke down and they had to tow it into gib but um the old ship your ship would think you'd been hit cause there was a terrific movement of water a surge of water when they're dropped yer so had you seen ships being sunk around you by then well again we had that one actually when i was on the cambrian coast one ship we were picked up in convoy and a ship ahead got sunk one of the little coasters got sunk and well you heard the bang and suddenly the ship had gone so i mean you just plod on you don't know the situation there was usually they'd be a ship a tug go a stern of the convoy to pick up the survivors so they'd pick up survivors yer what is a gun layers course and why did you go on that well it's a step up from the seaman gunner which i was you got i don't know what a little bit of an increase in wages and as i was on coastal ships i was the other two were seaman gunners you were in charge of the gunnery so from that aspect and you got a rise in wages and this was done at leith and i mean in the end you had to go to sea to fire off there's a little story there on a little coaster and a biddy and the skipper to pass you out on this course to pass as a gun layer and you had to fire a twelve pounder gun different positions on the gun and the procedure if if the gun failed to fire according to the annual you just put it to safety and leave it but the bloke in charge of it he just opened the breach took it out and said gun now what was it he give an order and threw it over board and then carried on with his lesson but i mean that was not according to the book but i mean if that gun couldn't use it we couldn't pass because we was at sea so that's how it went on anyway i passed that i mean another one i had to go in one of these where the bloke in charge was sitting and they got these rockets each side which they fire and as your learning the trade you'd sit beside one bloke one side and the bloke in charge here and he fired these rockets well the poor bloke do you know there was blood coming down his nose i mean when they go off it's unbelievable cause they're on ships not on merchant ships they'd be on a cruiser or whatever there's terrific noise so you had to pass that this was done at somewhere on the <LOC>southeast<\LOC> <LOC>coast<\LOC> hartlepool area where we went yer what is said well the next ship you did was the malayan prince and that was an unusual cargo just tell me about that were you in convoy with that cargo malayan prince hang on i've got to think on that one oh yes we had a very unusual cargo here we loaded this was money it was printed in britain and we had to take this out to alexandria in egypt so having got out there when it was being discharged we had to have rifles own stand on guard quite a bit of money passed hands there i assume yer you went through the suez canal what was that like well i did remember one thing i told you i had to learn the art of hairdressing i went as an apprentice malayan prince was quite a biggish ship it was a twin screw so we were commodore ship going through the mediterranean so we had a commodore on board so i'm aft in our quarters and they sent one of the boys down down below decks to see me will you they say from the bridge they tell me there's gunner down there that can cut hair the commodore wants a hair cut would you come up and give him hair cut well i mean just by hand clippers so i mean i did it i well remember doing one bloke at sea just an ordinary rating well army lad where we had a bofors we had an army crew come down for a hair cut down the mess well i give him a haircut but i give him a mohican haircut if you understand me he had a tuft which he didn't know he had down he went back to his mess and come back what the hell do you think you're doing i said well it's only a joke come on i'll put it right well any way went off and there was the skipper the commodore we're up on the boat deck in the mediterranean it's a lovely day and there's me with my hand clippers giving the commodore a hair cut i never spoke about it i'm only the lower decks really so um having done it he said well i haven't got any money on me at the moment gunner but see me at alex i'll see you get a bit of money for it sort of thing so that was it so we arrive in alex well i knew he'd be going a shore so obviously i'm sort of on deck looking up and he i see him sort of go over to the skipper and i don't know i suppose he give me a couple of bob or something like that he went ashore yes that was the end of him was he nice oh quite pleasant quite pleasant yes well he was getting a cheap haircut wasn't he and at sea and the talma was an interesting ship it was a hospital ship well she was a very old ship old ship but i mean we had all english doctors nurses aboard so i mean we didn't have much to do with them really apart from the different ports we went to we had to do sabotage watch i well remember one place this was at calcutta you sort of walked round the firm had a indian bloke there to make sure the right chaps were coming aboard and i well remember him turning round one bloke he said him no good johnny him sick cock so i don't know whether he'd got venereal disease i don't know but then he'd go and make me a cup of tea and things like that so friendly yes did it was it a different experience at this point to the war i mean is it any more enjoyable period well yes i mean the war with <LOC>germany<\LOC> is over but at this period i mean the japs i mean the thing with singapore that's where we were bound for well i mean there we spent quite a bit of time having got up to calcutta by this time the british had re conquered rangoon on the burma side and we were going down the ganges over to rangoon with indian troops leave them there coming back more troops and that's what we were doing for quite a while then finally the convoy left rangoon and cause we had the big boys with us then making for singapore that was the idea so i mean going down that coast i was friendly with the sparks and he kept me informed he said well we just had a phone call come through not a phone be a message come through the yanks have just dropped two atom bombs and the japs have apparently surrendered so well that was a good news that i mean to go into singapore that was we'd be well armed so all we done really was mine sweepers ahead of us and we just sailed into singapore and the being a hospital ship we was tied up we were tied up alongside and cause prisoners of war flocked to the docks and well we had food aboard but obviously nature you'd say you know well obviously give him something course they stopped all that we weren't allowed cause they had to be bought back to life again you know on a normal diet they couldn't eat a sandwich as you put it they were shocking what did they look like well thin obviously thin but they stopped all that but were you shocked when you saw them well they were in a state they were horrible yes i expect you've seen photographs of them horrible yes horrible how did you do you remember how you felt when you saw things like that well i don't think you got used to everything you accepted it i mean we was quite interested with i don't know what officer we had there we had a ship there anchored the other side i think it was going to take the japanese surrenders i'm not sure who it was but again i knew at the time i've forgotten the years have gone by many moons have gone by haven't they what is said can i ask how do you reflect on the war now well well i'm glad to be alive and you know and pleased i survived i mean cause a lot of the lads lost weren't they lost a lot of boys yes sorry i'm stammering now it's emotion sorry glad to have done your bit then well yes yes
 just tell me a bit about why did you join the navy in the first place because i wanted to i'd run away from home and joined the navy when i got to the navy place i was sixteen and i'd been in the home guard before that one of the best shots with a rifle or a machine gun up on the place here and i run away from home you see and i was a good swimmer and i just to do a lot of high diving in and what have you at the place we had here which is now gone and you know the water drew me somehow so one night i just packed my kit and left home and i had a bit of a struggle to get into the navy because i wasn't quite the age they would of liked but anyway they put me into the ganges and the other lads had just been sent up across the water to the isle of man because they were being bombed you see and i was the only one that went in as i were and came out at the end i done well i'd been in the home guard as a younger man and done all my machine gunning and bomb throwing in the home guard and course i got a good start on everything explosives didn't bother me or frighten me of nothing so yeah i enjoyed it i loved it and what was it like then ganges why did you enjoy it so much well i wasn't there long because as soon as i got there the first thing you have to do is put a wetsuit on and you have to swim the length of the pond and back and until you can do that and you don't get away but i was a good high diver because not far from here there used to be a high diving board and i'm red hot at diving and consequently i was straight out and i had to do a couple of little runs up to scotland and do some work up there with other chaps and one way and another i was seen to be doing jobs on little boats back and forth up to scotland several of us was doing it and the next thing i decided i would i was in chatham you see i decided i would study a bit in there i done all in the home guard i'd done all my rifle work and everything and was red hot with machine gun in wellingborough and i was a very fit man you know but anyway after you pass what you want to do when you leave there i wanted to be a torpedoman you see so i joined the torpedo part and that actually didn't suit me when i got in there that didn't but anyway i got in and got out and then another chap sat with me we both passed out and went into jobs in the dockyard basically until we got a ship is this at chatham no this is at yeah chatham sorry i'm getting mixed up and soon as that happened we messed about a little bit in the dockyard doing work and then the savage she was down on the where all the trouble was down south she came flying back because she was desperately needed to go up to murmansk run and me and the chap were in there we both went aboard her and got picked up and took her to scapa flow and that was it and of course we done one after the other up there what do you remember of the chatham dockyard what was it like as a place for a young boy well i mean i was a young boy and i thought everything was wonderful actually the first thing i did because the savage hadn't come up then she was down just finishing down where the battle was going on and they sent me in the dockyard to do a job until the ship come up you see and i was in that submarine i had to go in that submarine that was in dry dock that had fooled the germans and the spaniards when they put that dead body in the channel between them do you remember it well they fooled the germans that it was a german that had been they actually put a body they got a dead mans body a genuine dead mans body from up north and they put it into this submarine and they actually dressed it all up as a man trying to take information to the spaniards in you know on the coastline and they sunk it they took this dead body and bound it and done it all made it all look smart in a uniform not service uniform but in clothing and they put a thing on his arm with a great big attache case with dummy information of what was happening because he was supposed to be a german spy you see it's a film it's fantastic anyway that little submarine that i had to go and work on had just come back from taking the body and floating it in the spanish coastline to drift ashore and they dressed it all up as one of their sort not ours you know and it all worked what was it like going into the savage for the first time you know your first proper draft can you remember well i'll tell you what it were she was down on the battlefront and she was called away because she was needed for this and we were down there torpedo course and were having to work in the dockyard during the day time and then vittles in the canteen at night and anyway we got piped for and we both got told to get our kit ready and take it in the dockyard and the savage came in from being down at the bank where they had been fighting and she'd been pulled right up and they were loading her up with stuff and alongside and we got called and put aboard her and that's as quick as that but i'll tell you what the bloke that was with me he died not about three weeks ago and we're both together you see and we both took the course together and we both got put on the savage she came in in the afternoon and pulled alongside and god it was murder they were having to do all sorts of things because we've got to race up with this big convoy what was coming from canada and already there was loads up in north <LOC>scotland<\LOC> waiting for the convoy to move or and this well we knew it well anyway they piped for us two and we went on to the window where they tell you where you were going and they sent us straight to the savage in the dockyard and what the savage was having to do was take on ammunition and everything else and it was pouring with bloody rain at night it bucketed down and we had to go down further down the coast because we joined it and when we went on we were there forever we'd been drafted to her which was alright but we went done to when it got dark we went down to the ammunition place which was a long way down the water from us and it was bucketing down and god blimey we had an ammunition ship in the dark and it was and you went along this pipe not pipes boards and they were springing up and down carrying stuff out pitch black and this ship was shipping water it was raining so hard anyway we're all carrying stuff up along the landing you know to fill her up with ammunition and that and we sailed from there at midnight up between ireland and that to join this here big convoy and you'd never see it rain like it god almighty i was a lookout and my mate was on the other side of the bridge in the look out and we was bloody soaked to the skin pitch black and of course we had to put all new ammunition on her before we could sail from there because that was where the ammunition bunkers were down there anyway we got up in the early hours of the morning we reached liverpool that area and then it started to lighted up a bit but it never left off driving rain and we went right the way up to the north where we got to pick this convoy up and they were all more or less ready to sail it was the biggest convoy of the war and every type of ship was there and course we joined her and i mean i've never been to bloody sea you didn't know where you were because we hadn't been trained for it i thought it was too quick but anyway we managed alright me and me mate the first thing were you were all mixed up because the ship shipping water all the way and i went down into the front of the ship and it was half full of water and it was half full of water and it was shipping over the top you see it was one of the worst storms of the war running up that coast and but anyway i don't mind admitting it i felt so bloody sick going up to russia i wasn't too bad going through the channel as i said but when we actually got going i thought cor blimey i got billeted they hadn't got room for us down in the main place and i thought i felt as sick as a dog so i cleared myself and went up and they got the aft gun turret looking forehead so it was open to the direction we were going on the back of the gun shield and it had curtains heavy curtains that go over because they had no doors or anything behind them and i slept there all night i did all night christ i did feel ill and my mate he was somewhere else i don't know where he went but i was never sick again well i wasn't sick i felt sick but i was never like it again but i'd always been a good swimmer and everything you know and diver i was good at diving so why that ship upset me like that i didn't know but i stopped in there until we got two days away from here as you might say and i never looked back the savage was a well oiled ship she wasn't got a depth under water like an up and down engine ones she had electric turbines steam turbines made all the electric but she didn't draw half as much under the water as an ordinary destroyer or and ordinary sloop which was proved on the last day of the war of the convoy and we were all waited outside to go through the mountain gap into the russian end and a u boat was waiting for us and we were all there and the convoy was coming in and it's on the telly sometimes convoy was coming in and spreading about but the germans were waiting underneath the cliff bottoms and you could only go into the dockyard through and entrance not much wider than that with two great pillars of coastline so you had to go in one at a time and the big liberty ships used to squeeze through it anyway this was the last convoy of the war and we were hanging about there as the ships were coming in with stuff to take in and this u boat was laying under the rocks opposite us it was snowing in the morning when we took up our position to cover them as they come in because they got liberty ships with them you know with railway engines on them and that from america and the first thing that happened one of them got torpedoed as it went to go through the opening into the harbour where you go up further to it because the ship broke in half and sunk in the gateway well we called it a gateway cause there's chaos then because the rest of the flotilla their flotilla and the people we brought up were coming in to this big opening where we were all waiting for the others to go in and we were all ready for everything me and my mate were put down below to push the depth charges up hook them on and then they were pulling them up ready to go we never heard a torpedo coming or i didn't but the others on deck did they could hear it coming but they didn't know where it was and it went under the savage and it hit a brand new ship just as far away as the other side of the road and everyone was practically killed on it it sunk like that brand new but why didn't it hit the savage shallow draft shallow draft yeah she had flat engines that were driven by shafts that way right at the bottom and they drove these two generators i used to go down one of my jobs as you go down every morning and check all the things that could of stopped it and make sure everything was alright that was one of my jobs you see and i used to stand there and watch because what they were there was no propellers what they were on the bigger ships that were right low down weren't they it was only drawing half as much water as one of them and that torpedo went under us and it hit the other ship on the other side and we picked some of the men up six we buried one we went in we were fighting until dark out there all the rest of the ships and you see this liberty ship they hit it with a torpedo and it blocked the entrance you see and then it went down in the entrance i mean how do you get rid of that can you remember well i don't know because it was up to the russians to do their own work on that so we were fighting until dark at night and it was snowing at eight in the morning when we started until it got dark and we buried one chap it was quite dusk getting dark and we buried him and we had to go right up nrth futher to come in another way from the north and down inside the water because we couldn't get in you see it was terrible it was the last convoy of the war and when came out they had opened that up the russians had it was christmas we had christmas day there and we were there for two or three days and when we come out we could come out that way and we came out at midnight two of us and we had to go north run up the coastline and the other one no we went south and the other one went north listening for u boats and while we were there we were dropping the convoy was ready to come out empties all ready to come out and we were sent each way us and the other one to keep anything down you see and try and find if anything was there and whilst we were doing this the convoy came out in the pitch black and by the time it got light in the morning they were well away from where we were so we had to catch them up you see and which we did and she came home alright never had no problems after the convoys of the arctic then you didn't stay on the savage very long didn't you well i stayed on the savage until the german surrender and we came back down to chatham at chatham barracks in the dockyard and i was sent for because as you see i was a volunteer i joined underage hence it made me a volunteer not a conscripted man we came down to the chatham dockyard i got sent to the place added in you in and out and i had to pack my kit and the next morning i was put on a train with hundreds more in the dockyard locked in with keys and they take them out so you can't get out and this train went straight of flying down to southampton we got out and there was a bloody great liner there waiting for us all full of people going to the far east and she was due to sail at half past eight and it was half past six then and you couldn't get on anywhere for people it was a bloody great american liner can't think of the name there was two of them made but anyway we sailed that night within two hours we were on the water going out and that took us right out to ceylon and that's where we were took off there don't know where she went from there because she was loaded to the top with we had to stop before we could go through the canal to get out to because by the time we got there it was pitch black and we went on from there down the next morning through the canal which was such a big ship and the next thing we went right out to ceylon and that's when they bumped us off was there any do you remember anything of that troop ship there wasn't no room for us on the top deck and the gale god it blowing a bloody gale and all our kit had been left down below where it had been dumped and there was a load of women on there in uniforms and that and we had to sleep on the open top deck and it was bloody freezing and we went through the canal went right out and then straight out to ceylon and they dumped us pretty incredible really when you think you know one minute you're in polyarny in a battle and then two days later that's right that's how quick it was they were waiting for troops you see and she was full that ship they had two of them did you have any fear of going to the far east no i didn't know what it was like did i i mean i had a feeling what it might be like but i didn't i wanted it you see that's why i runway and joined the navy i wanted the navy and when that all came well i was on top of the world she was a nice ship but i never had done any minesweeping or nothing and she was not a chatham ship you see but everybody else we got on like a house on fire but this one bloke and he was in the same mess as me he used to sit opposite me at the table and i don't know why he took to me but anyway he found out i was a chatham man and that's how i think started it i shouldn't of been there really but everybody else we were like bricks together but he where we used to go down to sleep below if we wasn't in any danger we used to go down there and down there you've got another mess deck and your hammocks down there if you can and he was in the same mess as me sitting opposite me and he just used to sneer at me and i never had a bloody enemy on that ship and they made me chief quartermaster and they didn't like that you see and that give me quite a run of the ship and then the captain had me up in his cabin and he had a chat with me and he told me what he'd like me to do and it was nice i mean i was in charge of the steerage which means the other chaps are under me straight away but i've never steered a bloody ship but i had to and i mean it hasn't got a compass like where you see the hands going you've got numbers flicking backward and forwards and you've got to read them but we did have one of the old ones what about this ship the japanese ship that you were escorting tell me about that well that was the biggest of their cruisers don't ask me the name i can't tell you but it was the biggest one they had and she'd been bombed and she lay in the harbour and we used go by her every time we went in or out but we thought she was on the bottom but she wasn't but anyway it was one of the biggest japanese ships and it had been bombed and it had been in singapore harbour for quite some time since it was his but anyway unbeknown they were making it ready to tow it and sink it you see and we got chose to do it and we were coming on our way home as it happened we left singapore a tug with her two tugs with her actually and she was a massive ship and she'd been emptied and everything and it had got dark and we're coming up the malacca straits and we got to this point where she was supposed to of been sunk the deepest water because she was the biggest one they had at the time and consequently it was pitch black and we're on our way to come home you see it come to midnight and two japanese tugs that were towing her had been towing her right out on as far as that big house there from us but they were coming up the coastline and we were further out where we could keep an eye on her and everything and as i say it got pitch black and by the time we got to the point which we had a compass reading which we'd got to sink her on they started the ship coming up and left her they bolted and left the ship with no head way and she come half way up to where she was supposed to be sunk and i expect our captain got permission to sink her but it was midnight pitch black and we had our search light on her and they vanish into the black and gone and of course she's drifted well she wouldn't drift far you know she's a massive ship but she's only just off the coastline as we saw her pitch black and i'm still on the bloody wheel and of course looking out of the wheelhouse because we weren't going we were just hovering and then i suppose the captain got in touch with their people and they said what to do so we had to send men over with depth charges because we carried depth charges and they've got to put the depth charges as low as possible in the ship because there is nobody on there and i mean it was massive and they'd got to wire everything up and all we could do was use our depth charges and try them that's all we could do well we did we did it it was midnight when we started and we were drifting as far away perhaps as this first house from her and course you couldn't do much really because our motor boat went over and they put four depth charges in her in the motorboat and that's all she'd hold you see carry and so they took them over from off us it was our crew doing it and whatever they'd done they went aboard the ship and they took the depth charges as the captain said had got to be done and put them right down in the lower end of the ship because i mean she was a bloody massive thing and they did everything they could and fused everything that would explode and came back to us and bang she did she went down blew the bottom out and she went down but off course we never see her no more because we left her there but she wasn't too far off the coast and she was too far from penang the ship wasn't we were going up towards penang did you see her going down then oh yeah we watched without search light bet that was a special thing to see well we hung on until we more or less her mast was sticking out but she's still going she was still going down our men put depth charges all the way along so when she got to a certain depth they'd open the bottom of the ship to let the water in as you do and they had to sit there until it filled up and fired these charges and it was bloody you'd never see anything like it it was fabulous but of course you wasn't allowed to have cameras just talk a bit about how you would mine sweep the story about what you do and how you do it well there is various ways you can do it you can do it with wires out with floats on well there's different ways you can put depth charges down put them down to certain depths and leave them down there weighted them down it depends what's going to be there over them when you come back but basically you only do it to clear the ocean in the area you were in and if you give ships colliding with them we get sent out there to sweep it did you have any near missed with the mines well we've had them come up beside us yeah a time or two but when you're all joined together with great strong wires you're in a formation like that and each side of it goes out to another ship and then they go out to another one and then out to the other then you've got seven but you're the one in the front you're the one that's got probably more equipment that you can sound than the others so they do that sort of thing they keep improving on certain things and we may have been a little bit better i don't know but that's how you sweep you all over latch each other you've actually got wires holding you together in a position no no it's all done free they had to set one each side of you at a certain distance then vice a versa for the next that's how you do it that's when you do that type of sweep but there are other ways you can sweep and we used to do sweeps with long wires we had a great big thing on our quarterdeck and it was full of heavy wire and we used to let that out with things on that and captain on the bridge he'd say let go and he's stop it when he tells you it's a massive sack of wire on a drum and it's not heavy wire but you put anything on the end of it and you could let it out and it would explode mines if it finds them if there's any there you'll know where you stand a little bit better it's all done on luck really because you can't look down in the sea but we used to snag up on we snagged up on an airplane down there that had crashed well we were told it were but i never seen it but i know when we snagged it it got around the ship that it was a plane but i don't know how they knew because we didn't stop but you always got somebody that made something up didn't you you mentioned this about this chatham and pompey rating when you say he made life difficult what do you mean how did he do that what was well i'll tell you what happened we come home to england and i had the most of the time because i used to go up and sit with him and then i'd take over because i was responsible for him you see so they didn't have a long thing i'd just take it you see and help out and one night when i was doing that i had to be a quartermaster which means when we were at anchor i had to do a duty at the back of the ship where they come in and out of it when they go ashore and one thing and another and all the logbooks there and everything and i was on duty there doing mine and we was almost coming home at this point and i'd got a terrible throat and cold and it was pouring with rain and i had to take the night watch and i thought well i got a cold and i took my oilskins out of my locker because they'd been there since we went abroad i mean you never had them out and i thought god i'm going to go down and get my oilskins and of course i'm standing in an opening because you can go in that side walk straight out and of the ship the other side and at night time there is an officer and a crew come around the ships and they check if you're being looked after and that as i went down to get my i nipped down because i got the duty watch to get my oil skin out and i got a terrible cold and this chap slung his hammock right across the top of the opening and walk down the step under to there and he's winging about in his hammock and of course this is one o'clock in the morning and unbeknown to me the boat come around and seen that i wasn't there but that didn't catch nothing but he told the captain that i had been down the locker and id been having a job to get the thing open because it was all stuck together being in the heat because we never wore them you see there and the next thing he dropped me in it and he told the officer of the day that i was going down to sleep and i'm sitting trying to get this bloody thing open and of course i've got a lousy cold and he done that and the next thing he sent for the officer of the day and he come down and put me on a charge i had to meet the captain and everything and the captain didn't like it at all but anyway he told me to forget everything he says you're my man he says never mind about him he said we've had trouble with him before' i brought the ship home right the way up to the dockyard and the next day i come home had three days leave and had to go back down to chatham again because they were demobbing they were all finished you see by then they never give me a demob suit or nothing so i went to this to see what was happening and they said oh you're going up to scotland there's a ship up there you're going on' so i said oh yeah how am i going to get there' he said it's alright there's two other chaps coming up with you you'll all be going together and that was that big ship up there of course she was only on loan during the war you see to us lot because canadian you see got to go home i was billeted on her for they put us on there to sleep and everything quite a few of us and we slept onboard and everything but by the time they wanted to take her home to canada they sent for me and i went to the office and i had a bit of a problem and i had to see the doctor and the bloody doctor said i wasn't fit to go so they paid me off the day before it sailed and i had to come out the navy i'd got something in the chest and i had to see the doctor and he said you're not fit enough he said anymore for the navy cheeky bugger
