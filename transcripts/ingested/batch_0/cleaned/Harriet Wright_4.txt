when were you in ilfracombe what year was it it would have been i joined up july forty three so i would have got there at oh august probably forty three august forty three and then i was there for quite several months anyway quite a while from there i was posted to barrow gurney near bristol and that was a hospital for more or less shell shocked um service navy personnel really and marines and so forth and i was mostly on night watch there it was only just prior to going to westfield college and every night every hour there was a i think he might have been either a po or a cpo complete with gown used to do the rounds making sure that none of the um inmates had escaped for instance because they were all rather shell shocked you know but i had no no bother well i wasn't there all that long it was only a matter of weeks before going off to westfield college um i suppose you see when i was at ilfracombe as well there were three um elderly marines that manned the switchboard well two were elderly i suppose too old to go to the front for instance but bernard wasn't that old but he um i think he might have been wounded and sometimes they were sent to to because it was easy work and not at the front you know and there was one day when one of them was ill and um they wanted a break so i said well i can work one of those because it was only a very small one and so i got on it and that was one of the reasons i think they sent me to barrow gurney before going to learn the whole um from the very smallest to the largest switchboard and um at hampstead after um we had the course the last day we went to the admiralty well when i got in there all these rows of things you know and i thought how on earth can i get up there there was a kind of a footrest and you would on a fairly high stall but i thought goodness i had to aim the plugs up at the top you know and if you cut anybody off well that would be the end of you you know but i managed but oh that was massive and that was the sort of last little bit of our training we went to the admiralty just off horse guards parade you know it was then all covered in ivy i remember but um i passed that in two weeks instead of three but i think that's because i had a bit of knowledge anyway on the smaller ones so just describe the sdo and the various ones you worked on um now in when i got there that was the first posting after i went to westfield college and we had always two maybe three on duty there you know two or three and when the light comes out you obviously plug in and if you're quick or if you're doing your partner or the next person will pick that up and then you have to test always test and you can tell by the crackle if you just test it if there's crackling on the line you know it's engaged so if you over plugged some of them some of them you can over plug and they won't be cut off but others you it depends on the machine you know i don't think they do these things nowadays anyway but um i think i could still work them and you're basically this is primitive telephone isn't it oh well yeah it would be now it would definitely and who were you patching through to who and where were you where were you well you got everywhere you see um for instance i'd been on watch when um there might be a call coming through that everything is pooled out because it's urgent and they get special treatment right through very urgent things that are secret they would just say 'scramble' and if you listened in you wouldn't hear the men you wouldn't understand because it had just scrambled you know so you always knew there was something going on if there was anything like that happening there would be something that wasn't supposed to be generally known how did they scramble is that you well we didn't do that they did it from their ends you see and it would only be these sort of head persons in charge the captain or whoever it was of the ship because they always called them ships anyway though they were land based they were all the ships hms this and hms that you know
