harriet edith prosser was when i joined the friends that was my name harriet where are you from and why did you decide you want it to be a red well i have had other people ask me that and i think
myself because i was open haired a pale skinned and freckle faced i didn't think that the e t s would suit me the uniform you know and i thought that the navy
blue wood and i think that's the only reason because we didn't live by the sea we were lived in land you know farming stock where are you from aberdeenshire
so you say what what what impact did the war have on you as a young girl living in abiding well am i was still at school of course i went to inverurie academy and i was still at the academy
and i remember am there used to be a reconisence plan come over every night you could almost set your watch by it eight clockish and you
i knew we all knew that the engine had a different noise to it you know so you could tell that it was a german plane and then one night it was much more noisy
and my father went outside mother went outside and then i decided i would follow and i had my hand on the door knob still this hand and all of a sudden we heard the
histle and it was a bomb that they dropped in a ploughed field only about a quarter of a mile away so that made me think that was you know at that stage when you're up there you
don't think of er well conflict like that do an especially in the country and yet this is what happened and the lovely firework display all the sparks coming up on the greens and
what not you know but i think if what happened was a aircraft had come up from our broth they couldn't come up from dice because the right on top of dice you see been right on top or die and
he had dropped this bomb to get away quickly but they had two bombs in aberdeen they bombed the ice rink and
one other thing i can't remember what and then i went into aberdeen one day a for some shopping and believe it or not i still can't understand why i did and i heard this plain
and i'm looking up and it was just roof top high and they were using the machine guns rat a tat tat you know and and i'm standing there like that waiting for the bus
at the country but station and school hill waiting to go home what an idiot instead of runnininin to the doorway or something like that you know so i got this sort of thing a ver
early on and we ourselves thought they were maybe after the every in a tan for bridges see if they bombed those they would have had an awful lot of trouble getting round
a long way to go you know for the trains and things to get say up to this so to get stuff over to the orkneys and that sort of thing so i thought right i won't do my bit and

 so you've decided to do your best what do you remember of that enrollment process am well i had to go to see at one time edinburgh capital glasgow dandy
was the third city abedin fourth when the oil came around of course abedin is third city now but at that time i had to go to dundee for my medical now this strange thing about
that was when i got out of the station i'd never been to care for before and yet i know i knew where i was going i knew exactly what room i was going to head for and i could never
nderstand that that was most strange but obviously i was meant to go in the rent to go there for my medical and i have passed it obviously and then got the car
up and did my training at bali on lalomand which was rather nice except that before that are we got there before the renter grove the americans had been there
and they left lock stock and battle leaving dirty things here there and everywhere you know and when we got there they were building new lose but until
they were finished we had these open loose you know i didn't like that at all in fact there were five of us that we got off after lunch every day and
five of us used to hair down to ballas station to have a you know a comfortable case because it was awful to sit and then somebody else coming in and then of course what he had to d
o was to empty those daily but that didn't last for long because the others the flush loos were already within a few days but
until there you ought to send away here down the valley to get on these lads you know how did you you know you you mention that you were a country girl but how did you find that sort of
i imagine a very relaxed comfortable you know okay tough but but carefree existence to military life how did you find that change a i don't know
i'll tell you this that while am this contingent was there the wrens could within the two weeks training if they didn't like it they could leave i don't
think this applied to the wife all the eight yes but there were two girls and i mean you were put to scrubbing floors and things like that it's all part and parcel of your training
nd these two girls they just wouldn't do it you see and off they went they weren't going to and yet one of the permanent staff there are a leading ren had said to them it's not like this when you finish you
training it's only here you'll be doing this she won't be doing that elsewhere you know but they didn't listen so i don't know i just scrubbed the floors and dies of a store more or less
and well i think if you set your mind to do something and you want to do it you have to get over the initial training or whatever was it military
so it isn't he says like he was a particle military base he was well you've got to talk about squad bashing of course you had a the tallest on the right shortest on the left i always knew where
i had to go because i'm so short left but again you didn't do much of that afterwards you only did that you know while you were there but i was very glad i wasn't the shortest
about the third the shortest when i was there so i was quite happy because when they do the right wheel and left wheel et cetera i'd be going the wrong way i'm sure but
i enjoyed it we had a test i don't know if everybody did but i certainly had this test was to do with the say are
matic and various things am in case he wanted to be supplies or whatever but as i got the whole of the paper right
they didn't know what to do with me so that's why i ended up as a messenger to start with but having said that we then went down to from there we went down to earls court and
boston gardens of the holding depot before you're posted on to somewhere else you see now we were all scots there near nearly all of us were scots come sunday we had to go on divisions
you know what divisions are you know in a so we marched to the church and as we got to the door of course the normal squad halt catholics fall out so in we went
and it was very very high church they were swinging the incense and chanting and we had such a simple service you see in scotland where i was not to much glasgow would have been different but the
east of scotland and different very simple and come the next sunday a those that of us that were still there said shall we
ask if we can fall out like the catholics so will you be spokeswoman so we all went there but i was spokeswoman and i said well we know we've got to go on divisions et cetera b
ut really can we fall out and go to a church of our own you know scotland just in scotland or something because it was far too high for us we didn't i went to bob up and down
you know that kind of thing and we were told by the regulating petty officer on duty you were here for such a short time that you're more or less do as you do and now i didn't
ike that that's the only thing that i had a quibble about because i don't think that should have been happening and what can you do about it we didn't want to be on commanders defar
tes and so we did as we were told and then the following week of course most of us had gone after that but you were there usually about two weeks maybe three and then off to plymouth
and a plymouth was again a holding depot but we were in houses in manamed and one of the aren houses had been bombed just two doors up from where we were
until they did have it quite badly bombing in the in plymouth and we're there for about another two weeks but we didn't have to go on divisions and then off we went to ilfocom

 now while i was although i was a messenger rene sally and myself were the three there and we were taking and logging signals and
mostly they were signals from say no north africa a lot of i learned more about the human body i suppose then than i ever knew befor
or you know because they come through wounded in action and let maybe give you the details most of the time they would sometimes it didn't and then they would end up by saying a next of kin
informed or not informed well we didn't do that bit we had to log these signals then get signatures from the officers in charge of a wherever you know to
so from that point of view it could be very sad but you just had to let it ride over you you know but i suppose if you were over sensitive i don't know
but we three of us coped all right but we were next door the s t o then there was the switchboard in there and that we were next door to the commanding officer who
was i think he was a lieutenant colonel then or he made it may have been colonel his name was boy so everybody said he was a very strict but
a quite fair well if we had a turn of the giggles for instance we would have not not not on the role and that made us laugh even more now
but if one of the marines made up a little ditty about him and it went i can still remember it there lived a colonel long ago rejoicing in the name of po
but disliking this utensil he grabbed himself the nearest pencil and with a noise resembling glee he placed two dots above the in this manner somewhat showy
his staff now have to call him poe s and that was just an one read that made the same ate gigot fate did you know and so
how things were going on yes yes you could get a sense of that you could get a sense of that with the number of casualties and so forth that or coming through
great at the site stood out to you you you heard the name or you knew of well the names i didn't recognise any but but one of em
the chief officer ren officer in charge now what was her name something like wainwright i think with her one of her sons was the
killed and she was a lovely person really you know you consider your persons in charge are always a nasty but she certainly was when she was lovely
but she did have her i think come through you know they say that she died just be careful the mark of an oar that must have been quite romantic or
yes is the messages coming through to you coded no a kid they came through on a teleprinter in full they want god it can you just describe the se
well the set up as a biggish thing you know and then when you heard the thing the noise when it started up you knew there was something coming in you know and then you had to wait until that was finished and then i put t
ime of t o r time of receipt et cetera on there and that was it then from that point you had to log it in a book and and and then that book was circulate
it to the officer who was responsible for whichever section you know am i can't remember there was calver was one that got an awful
lot of those calls so he must have been in that section lieutenant carver s l v but i can't remember all of them now but were these were these specific you know were the relative to r
semen so i just let everybody in a well it didn't always say what it just gave her name and number you know but it didn't also couldn't really say that they were seaforth highlanders

 where were you a war you it would have been i'd joined up july forty three so i would have got there at august probably forty three
august forty three then he was there for quite several months and quite a quite well from there i was posted to barogerny near bristol and that was a hospital
for more or less shell shot a service all navy personel really are and marines and and so forth and i was mostly on my
watch there it was only just prior to going to westfield college and every night every hour he was a i think he might have been neither
or a s p o a complete with gun used to do the rounds making sure that none of the inmates had escaped for instance because they were all rather shell
shock you know but i had no no bother so well i wasn't there all that long it only a matter a week before going off to westfield college am
i suppose you see if one of us at africom as well there were three elderly marines that manned the switchboard while two were elderly i suppose too old to go
to the front for instance but bernard wasn't that old but he i think he might have been wounded and sometimes they were sent to h p l o two because it was easy work and
t at the front you know and there was one day one of them was ill and they wanted to break so as well i can work one of those cases was only very
small one and as so i got on it and that was one of the reasons i think they sent me to barogerney before going to learn the whole am from the very smallest to the
largest switchboard and at hampstead after we had the course the last day we went to the ad
malty well when i got in there all these rows of things you know and i thought how on earth can i get up there there was a kind of a foot dress and you were on a fairly high st
but i thought good a case to aim to plug shop at the top you know and if you cut anybody off well that would be the end of you you know but i managed but oh that was mass
and though that was a sort of last little bit of our training we went to the emeraldy yes of horse cots parade you know it was then all covered in ivy
i remember but i passed out in two weeks instead of three but i think that because i had a a bit of knowledge anyway on the smaller ones so
something just just described the s o and then the various ones he worked on m now in hampston when i got there that was the first posting after
i went to westfield college and we had always two maybe three on duty there you know two or three s erection and when the light comes out you often see plug
in and if you're quick or if you're only a doing your partner you or the next person will pick that up and then you have to test or will test and you can tell by the crackle if
you just test it if there's crackling on the line you know it's engaged as if you over plug some of them some of them you can over plug and they won't be cut off but others it depends on the machine you know
i don't think they do these things nowadays anyway but i think i could still work them a certain you are basically that this is primitive telephones oh well yes it would be now
oh definitely and who were you passing through the where were you where we well you got everywhere you see for instance i've been on watch when i am that m
be a call coming through that everything is pulled out because it's urgent and they get their special treatment right through very urgent things that is secret they just
a scramble and if you listened in you wouldn't hear the men you wouldn't understand because it just crumbled you know so you always knew there was something going on this anything like that you know happening there 'd be something at a
wasn't supposed to be generally known how did they grow well we didn't do that they did it from their ends you see and it would only be the sort of head
arson and yard the captain or whoever he was of the ship because they always call them ships anyway though the word land base that rolled the ships at him as this and at him as that you know

 okay so you've come from a rose so i think is a little yes oh well i stopped off at don firm them first of all for about ten days but that was a aura there
i managed to get a trip on to the h m s implacable there was the indefatigable the implacable and one other i can't remember what they is but this was the implacable and it was just being commissioned
and we rents that were in the holding depo were allowed on board if we wanted to go have a look around very interesting you know to do that so
then we from there i went to a twat first of all in the middle of the mainland of the orkneys then from twat to hasten where
at on the coast in sunny few about ten minutes from kirkwall and i would have thought myself they would have kept that one as the main airport they didn't they
using ski bray which was the r f slightly further in the men not all that big really but they used ski bray which was the r f instead of keeping hatton
on one with was faster like a rear is a place a well we had it was all nissen camps at an icon huts that we had and the old fire in the middle you know
a it was very very blowy up there very very blowy the weather could be simply horrible and being little both that way as well as this way
am i had difficulty getting the right size so my wellies were always rather big you got issued with wellington boots at south esters and that sort of thi
i and i remember i'd gone into coral for something and coming back it was raining and blowing and whatnot i nearly took off because my time bob was so big
when was going up to me that so and one took threes and shoes and they didn't always have my size and shoes in so about social
or play their loads loads of it because there there was everything there there was the reef and so forth and there were dances at various
the are bits and the drill holes and they were emptying am i was salvation army and oh i can't remem
be what we're all cold now but you could go in and have a egg and chips two eggs and chips lovely as great you'd know there was a war on you now when you were there
and they had a answer come were the enso groups there plenty to do plenty very famous people come in as well i didn't the
most famous i suppose that i ever went to see with nilfricoo and that was i want to one he was he a amy yankee doodle danley oh dear oh you would know him
he's not a very tall chap he came to because of course being loads of americans there in ilfryroom and they had some of the america
in entertain us no no no no no no oh oh dear did i can see him now ah ha ing of his name route would not make you
roomy something is it or somebody like that any rate might have been mickey rooney so if you had a the american boy friend and he
or take you to the des i went on leave from the orkneys and in those days if there was a plain going from hapston to the mainland and there was any room any rent
would be allowed to go so i was fortunate on one occasion only to go d c what would it been very small
plane cause they're only two men the the pilot and the co pilot and then there were us two rennes going well we got to inverness that just where they were going we got off at inver
it but my ears the noise you don't have that now do you when you get off planes but oh that was dreadful i couldn't hear a thing for hours you never get the noise was still there so i had my first
flight way back then that was night on the did you feel like you was in a pot part of the war effort did you oh oh up there yes definitely yes you see it's the fleet the home fleets there
at the basins gap afloat and yes when you say you felt it was important i mean now how much communication are you having or hearing from the ships what well
a yes when the ships were were coming back safe from the am convoys to russia yes there are
you'd hear that they were coming in but you'd have to listen in oh well eight for six squadrons back to night that means grins ashore to night that kind of thing he had the
and what about when ships wouldn't come back a well i i didn't know any didn't i've i've had a one
chappy that i d a date with once on the monday and he said see saturday but i didn't see him saturday because they had in norway they went to bob something in norway and his name was pain
and all pains were known as wackles you know they all are like dusty miller and bunge williams and things like that and whack of pain and he didn't come back but he was taken prisoner or found
glad to hear that afterwards so but i didn't know of any ships that had really been anywhere on a ship that had been sunk completely didn't know anybody but the trump

---  NEW VIDEO   ----
 just explain your relationship with the trumpeter well i met this chappy which is my my husband eventually am a
one of the dancers in the drill hall and every time he came in i knew had a date that night to
and then that he went with a crowd of them so if he wasn't ashore am one of the others would come and take us girls out he had the only time
that gwynn who's always clean shaven but you know that the navy is not allowed to just grow a moustache they must have a set so the number didn't you know that you oh yes
you can't have just a mustache now the air force you know they could grow the big moustaches but you've got to get permission to grow a set and of course when they went on after convoys of course it would have been the thing
to do is to grow a set because otherwise you know pretty cold shaving every day in and that and he only grew a set once and then he when he was demobbed
he shaved off the beard and kept the moustache and then my mother said to him one day i don't like you with that so he shaved it he wouldn't shave it off for me but he s
ave it off for a month he also was that the trumpeter was also on a a convoy to malta and i haven't got that photo
graphic as again my great nieces got it and as they were coming back from malta they called in gibraltar and they're eating bananas to suppose
no bananas here to be had so they were showing off i think four of them in the picture all tucking into these bananas so they were not only on the russian com boys
but they did the malta one anyway and they were also on the atlantic what was your feeling when he went off to sea to do is remember a
i don't think that i ever thought anything could happen that i see i i'm sure i didn't well i know i didn't you know we'll see you next time when you're back and a
the thought of it of being that dangerous although obviously it was how close did you feel the war was sometimes all well
as i think that one of the things that brought it home to me after d day was because i got a one of the americans i used to write to him it
wasn't that he was a boy friend as such you know what i mean but a friend and he was of german extraction and another one was of italian extraction no it isn't this
range they're fighting against the in the italians and the germans it was funny but marvin is the one that was killed in in belgium and i had one of my letters returned
and it wasn't until that point because i hadn't known anybody else that had been killed and it wasn't until that point that i realized just how bad it was
and then i had his he must have told his mother and that i was his girlfriend well i suppose i was a girl friend but i wouldn't say i was the girl friend if you know what i mean
and she sent me i've got it there actually she sent me cater things as well so poor old marvin but i just reading the
morning he was born in twenty nine i think i was twenty nine i was born in twenty i didn't think he was that much younger but still there
and you can't you mention it in delay did did your work increase up to day oh there was not yes yes there was always a lot of action going on busy switch bold etc
to one day but at hatston now again we didn't do a lot of them he prayed work but we did go
on divisions one day and you'd be nominated and very rarely were you on there but the captain in charge or the chap in charge believe it or not didn't like
res in the old lil stockings you know the thick lil stockings you only like them in silk stockings so well stilton viren really i don't whether we been pure so well the we
and pure silk i do know that and so only wrens that had silk stockings could go on parade because he didn't like like at the legs governed in it's the opposite way normally you kn

 what were you at this well the war finished and we came down lock stock and battle from hatton to haylesworth cause they closed hats on them
and halesworth had been an arif station so we had to mess with the men i don't mean i mean mess with the men you know
have your meals of things with the men and the rents were very lucky really because we always had teapots big teapots the old enamel ones but always in a teapot whereas when we got down there
i suppose they'd left a lot of the stuff there and they had arms so you never know whether you're having tea coffee or co cut or tasted the same instead of keeping one for tea only and one for coffee
only and so well oh no i didn't like that at all you ever be a yes i do i do indeed but there wasn't that much i think
london was probably the place to be and v day really because we still would be am on duty as being in communications i bore the cross f
lags on my sleeve rather than the or whatever and i think come you are always on duty to consider and watch keeping
if you have mornings or you have afternoons you have evening shifts and night shifts and i prefer that notary than a nine to five job
as a cool night return of their convoys lines of oh well no i was on loan to line as for three weeks somebody who'd been off two weeks or three weeks i can't remember but am somebody was off
sake so i had to go to lines to cover and during that time the nabob came in right and i could see there
these switch hops and things were underground a bit though not on the top slightly underground and i remember my tea breaker went up to ground level and you could
i watched these sold sailors come off the ship and they were all looking about sixteen to eighteen very young looking you know and as drunk as lords really they were but you can't blame them can
because there they were they could have been the bottom of the ocean by then you know and especially deciding to limp back to the lines you know well the funny thing is that years after when i
married alfred it wasn't until two years or so after i married him and i was talking about we're talking about the rent or the orkmills or something and i said something about the nabob and he said
did you say the neighbor he and his brother in law was on that ship so i must have seen him come off that day too and all these years later has to be sixty years
later or so we find this out isn't it a small world how do you reflect on the war now that that the war itself and your work in the war well i'm glad i joined up i must
t admit i think am i had a better time in the services than i would have had if i had just been working in whatever a
and war time well i i think am my first note wouldn't be my first year my second job after i was to
mobbed about its stange kitchen equipment in victoria street and there was a woman there she was older than i was and she had a son peter who was in i think
he was the army and he was in germany she never had a good word to say for instance about germans ever you know well would you believe peter was stationed there for a while
and he only married a german girl so she had to eat a word die but am i've made good friends i have no crams about and there's good and bad and every but
you know in every written race and nation so but i can what i can't understand nowadays is this conflict going on a inter
for instance how can people kill their own i just don't understand it well i i can see the point because as i say
in when we were in diplomatic service for instance one of our first postings was to our lagos in nigeria well again there are loads of tribes their pro
inded me a little bit of the scottish clans frankly you know and then of course they we had left just before the bows and the robots were there you know the
in the west because of the oil again am well tribe's okay but i can't see this in syria i really can't and i can't see why scotland wants to
separate either alex salmon wants his head sorted what about being a red how you hear about that are being a ran proud of it proud of it very proud
it now i when i was at the globe in laurel i bought another hat when i was transferred back to the fleet air arm of course i had to wear the m s so i
kept my a marine hat and every time i went on leave i would swap it over because nobody knew what i was then you see i was so proud of my marine and go well because i was
attached to marine the home base leg or office in ilfracombe it's really i suppose the pay office and that sort of thing that's why everything had to go through there when people were injured and died and so forth
am yes so i do know i used to notice people looking at me you see wondering what i was and i like that
