just tell me not your action station the guns but just tell me what are you doing on the deck just taught me through us or a day if you like when you were flying when you're flying well you got you fetch the plain top out to anger what you could got em all ready and that was it really took off we got nets down the sideways to jump in when they were taking off when you say you got ready i mean we make as well the wings were folded they are to be wings folded up yet we wound up you know it so if you had a wind engine up in on a swordfish yes like a big wait just like a car an starting on thing you know you now used to start the cows in the old days well they used to wind the engine like that on the short fish and he got cartridge and when when he got it really going at engine do you know this fire is cartridge pile it was to fire it and that finished it off you know after you went a it was i don't know whether you got to know any names but i had a mate on the path oil his name was and he come from down in walkin in surrey and he walked into a propeller blade but you were lucky it knock it knocked him out at road he said if he had been walk in other ways to kill him obviously played just istomin i don't know the play any time or what the wind did it at whatever but it we were lucky there and what was it like on the deck when a man how much mood just describe how much bots going on the movement and how many planes or be in maneuvered at the same time and how many of you are doing that job oh well there's the flight deck party up on there you can see them well everybody was occupied with doing something you know getting near it what's the name joe retires away as had to be seen to you know there's a there's quite a lot of jobs and yet what when molas taking off when wanted batters land in landing when they landed he to get in front of the barrier this way a barrier from the bridge across and you wheeled the planes up and got him in front of the barrier so that the other aircraft could land on without you now without doing any damage and how long did you get from a substantial moving a plane and walk out when we went very long i know you used to run with them though it weren't very long because they should circle around the ship you see and see when in the course of bachman then it will give them the signal did you ever do any dancing no now it is off is witton that now the chap we had doing that was i can else remember his name and call him temple westin and he had been on a nother carrier which got badly bombed in malta and you know course we got transferred to this one we had to what were the one legged pilot on as well and he'd he'd lost his leg and in an aircraft accident yes and what did you do the bass would ever get it wrong and you ever remember incidents oh yes i should imagine so sometimes if if the plane come in a bit too hi robbers who were going to land he had to wave him round you know you believe i have inside you are because what happened after activity it went when we're fully commissioned and we faint because we got the biggest flight there can any escort carrier so do you use us for it was a training carrier for nearly six months up up and down the slide and we had quite a few go inside out there in fact there was still be at most bottom and slide yeah trainee pilots coming into land use i don't know whether you know out about it not but there's one called the dasher it was american built carrier blew up in the lid and they were four hundred killed on it and we was in we was in harbour at the time in greenock was at our bays and we was waiting to go out that day and they stopped us going we said we didn't know what they said the ship's been torpedoed that's all we heard but it wasn't to which is even to this day they still discounting what happened some of the survivors said all the time they're on that ship they could smell aviation fuel so it was a bad fueling system and they always think that something blew it up now then another thing what somebody said a lot was smoking in atmosphere the match down and set it up which seemed a bit daft but the people in it are russian on opposite on the line they saw the lift blown up in the air and is he went up to our eight seventy eighty foot up in the air with some blows on it for it come crashing down so it must have been aviation fuel i love but even now they they go i don't now go every year now to where it is you know in a well we didn't they won't let us go you see because they said the sea was well we could see it from granite we could see that the all the smoke and that said the sea was a fire with aviation fuel and as my gin afar poor so got killed in with with with blowing up if you ever get the chance you'll get a book about a james dasher and i tell you all about it and what happen was at the time that when that happened a ship blew up cars to die no escort carrier so we had on to russian convoys
