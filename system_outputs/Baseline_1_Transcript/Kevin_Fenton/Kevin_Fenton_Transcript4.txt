and then you go on to the galahad won't you remember the gas was a light and you don't you remember when his fast went up to her i just well i was up he went on this london craft utility i just lose saw saw this big big vessel with this drawbridge it was down and we went to the of so the rear of the galahad and on to the on to this drawbridge get our equipment on then what i remember is i saw all these land rovers in the where where it was the tnk deck then then we were taken to our dormitories and that and and just sort out a able kit in the dormitories and everything else and then later on i remember a lot of our medical supplies were turned up for field surgical teams and everything you see so we had to go down to the tank deck and unload it from all these landing craft that came in with all the medical equipment and that lasted till we're in the early hours and ever so we were quite bushwhacked an ever so we all fell asleep out out like a light in the dormitory and and and then it was my em my belly warm me up and whenever though it was supper time it was about four o'clock in a tough about four o'clock i think it was so i walk up the landscape up upstairs and we ever a night into the galley and then about an hour later we were hit then up em some the lads said oh you've saved us i said what do you mean said don't be silly said do said do you realize a big a big hall went through our dormitory one of the shells went through the dormitory and one of the bombs no i said no said i said oh we you getting us up a saved us i said i just brushed it off really and well what was the impact like well we just when we heard the i just heard the heard the word action and that was it intestateons and there was a big boom and that the e we couldn't see anything that was scarcely even the mercy lights the red light space had gone em all i could see was this acrid smoke i just got down anywhere on the floor and whatever and that must at i think i automate ly got a handkerchief out my out my pocket and put it on my face on ever asked if anyone was around and were and one of the other made said aye and and i was feeling around and i said i said ging for that was the other lads name i said ginge i said to him i can feel even feel a feel someone here and feel a body in whatever and i did know who it was a said durham i said can you give me hand to put her take him out on to the deck and so managed to get him out realized it was our section corporal we'd been knocked out unconscious through the explosion and so we managed to get him onto helicopter and he was off for a few days then he came back later a few days later and and then i wit a busy went oh i went to another casualty and started treating him and whatever and rate ruptrapping his legs together and that someone managed to get me some morphine from somewhere and that i'll give this block some morphed managed to shout to someone to get him off on air off the ship and it s wasn't thinkin of triage i was thinking of percy literally getting him off the ship because just next to us was all these explosions probably the land drovers and all the ammunition that was down there as well and that a nose the medical kit burning as well and then i was telling others off cos bears walking over bodies cause some of em were like headless chickens bartley so it's it's it's our way any everyone reacts differently to other in the same situation really where are the ship are you at this point i'm on the deck at it but that i'm on the deck at this time and there's the explosions just next to me a nod and think about it now my e our major got hit by shrapnel in his head from one of his explosions and he wasn't far from where i i was with the casualty and or was he go he was killed you then two other med it to her two my mates were killed with a mortar patton who were down in the tank deck ready to disembark and the e two e made and one of them who wasn't supposed to be there in the first place because he was he was dealing with the rations back in aldershot in the unit for the rear party that was still there and that so i now and how quickly has the ship gone from being how quickly as it take you now gone from being a couple of sails in it or to basically becoming a lion really now a flaming rag or have you have you been confronted by that as soon as you've gone on deck almost well to be honest i wasn't take any notice of anything around me i was looking after taken out look after the patient and but i always think to this dear that i was protected by god's word because i believe in god and that i always have it hasn't changed my perception of it anywhere and that went of sea without so and then the only reality that happened to me was when a when this a seaman on the other side of the deck said do you think you'd better go off the ship and i looked round and there's no one yet no one there no casually no no medics or anything that's all jumped on the helicopters with the and nat so i must i'll think i must be in the only live medic still on board the ship the last live medic on board a not so then i buses went down a scaling ladder and nearly fell in a few times because i realized all these explosions round me even before and i was i was treating his casually and that the explosions just seemed distant not just above me and i and a man get into a life raft which was down just in the water so this life raft was pretty handy it was just it looked as if it was waiting for me and then and then i managed to go on to this mexifloud you know what mexyflot it's like a it's like a big piece of iron girder together a fit it together and it's a it's got mortars on the back so it ends up being a board and it can take anything on it it can take beastly a large vehicles and tanks and take them straight to the at the beach and that didn't drive off from that lucky and i you know what sort of injuries you're dealing with us when you're on the death and what kind of injuries you well burns but the year burns were up there by city tree well at the time it a these to use a saline and if someone's got their hands burned you put them in the in bags poly bags to stop any infection from the air common and whatever in saline and whatever and but the but then a but then they do treat indifferently in wever some day one time we used to carry cling film which we used to cover the burns over cause you can't you can't pull anything off then whoever if you got beastly em if someone's got clothing burnt to the skin you don't you can't you you don't get rid of it it has to be sagely removed but it's sterile to two of the fire and i caused it to be sterile and had so ram put em that's what they used to do and whatever and you can't cover the faces and we ever completely whatever you got a base obese have a er a field dressing probably with some a saline on and dab dab in the areas to try to cool it down whatever em and then i had one with the loss of muscle round the the base of his leg ye on his calf he just had a big hall here and that an office unconscious casualties like my second corporal he was unconscious a lot of facial burns obviously and a body burns because some of them were were in these nylon waterproofs which just melted and that my section sergeant bercy was trying to take this waterproof offer of this soldier and burnt his hands but he put he managed to get this a burning a jacket a rent raincoat a rain jacket off this a soldier
