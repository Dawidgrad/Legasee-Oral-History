GOOD START ON EVERYTHING EXPLOSIVES DIDN'T BOTHER ME AND FLOWING ME AND NOTHING I ENJOYED IT I LOVED IT AND WHAT WAS IT LIKE THE GANGES WHY DID YOU ENJOY IT SO MUCH WELL I WASN'T THERE LONG YOU SEE BECAUSE SOON AS I GOT THERE THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE TO DO YOU HAD TO PUT A WET SUIT ON AND YOU HAVE TO SWIM THE LENGTH OF THE POND AND BACK UNTIL YOU CAN DO THAT YOU DON'T GET AWAY I WAS A DIVER S NOT FAR FROM ME THERE USED TO BE A DIVING BOARD AND I READ HOT AT DIVING AND THAT AND CONSEQUENTLY I WAS STRAIGHT OUT I HAD TO DO A LITTLE COUPLE OF LITTLE RUNS UP TO SCOTLAND DO SOME WORK UP THERE

DESPERATELY NEED GOING UP TO THE MURMANSK RUN AND ME AND THE CHAP THAT WERE IN THERE WE WENT ABOARD HE GOT PICKED UP AND UP TO SCAPA FLOW AND THAT WAS IT AND OF COURSE WE DO IT THEN THE RUNS ONE AFTER THE OTHER UP THERE WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER OF THE CHATHAM DOCKYARD WHAT WAS IT LIKE AS A PLACE FOR A YOUNG BOY WELL I MEAN I WAS A YOUNG BOY AND I THOUGHT I THINK WERE WONDERFUL TO SERVE I MEAN ACTUALLY THE FIRST THING I DID CAUSE THE SAVAGE HADN'T COME UP THEN SHE WAS DOWN JUST FINISHING DOWN WHERE THE BATTLE WAS GOING ON AND I WAS PUT THEY SENT ME IN THE DOCKYARD TO DO A JOB UNTIL THE SHIP CAME UP YOU SEE AND I WAS IN THAT SUBMARINE BUT I HAD TO GO IN THAT SUBMARINE WHICH WAS IN DRY DOCK THAT HAD FLED THE GERMANS AND THE SPANIARDS WHEN THEY PUT THAT DEAD BODY OVER IN THE CHANNEL BETWEEN THEM DO YOU REMEMBER IT THEY FOOLED THE GERMANS THAT IT WAS A GERMAN THAT THEY ACTUALLY PUT A BODY THEY GOT A DEAD MAN'S BODY A GENUINE DEAD MAN'S BODY NORTH AND THEY PUT IT INTO THIS SUBMARINE AND THEY ACTUALLY DRESSED IT ALL UP THERE WAS A MAN TRYING TO TAKE INFORMATION TO SPANIARDS THE COAST LINE AND THEY SUNK IT THEY TOOK THIS AND BAN HADN'T DONE IT ALL MADE IT A SMART IN A UNIFORM SERVICE UNIFORM BUT IN CLOTHING THEY PUT A THING ON HIS ARM WITH GREAT BIG ATTACHE CASE WITH ALL DUMMY INFORMATION WHAT WAS HAPPENING BECAUSE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A GERMAN SO YOU SEE IF IT COMES IT'S A FILM IT'S FANTASTIC ANYWAY THAT LITTLE SUBMARINE THAT I HAD TO GO AND WORK ON HAD JUST COME BACK FROM TAKING THE BODY AND FLOATING IT IN BETWEEN THE SPANISH COAST LIKE SHORE AND DRESSED THEM ALL UP AS ONE OF THEIR SORT AS YOU KNOW AND IT ALL WORKED WHAT WAS IT LIKE GOING TO THE SAVAGE FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN YOU WERE YOU YOUR FIRST PROPER DRAFT DO YOU REMEMBER I'LL TELL YOU WHAT IT WERE SHE WAS DOWN ON THE BATTLEFRONT SHE WAS CALLED AWAY BECAUSE SHE WAS NEEDED FOR THIS AND WE WERE DONE A TORPEDO COURSE AND WE WERE HAVING TO WORK IN THE DOCKYARD IN THE DAY TIME AND THEN VITTLES IN THE TEN AT NIGHT ANYWAY WE GOT POT FOR AND WE BOTH GOT TOLD TO GET A KIT ALREADY AND TAKE HER IN THE DOCKYARD AND THE SAVAGE CAME IN FROM BEING DOWN ON THE BANK WHERE THEY WERE FIGHTING AND SHE'D BEEN PULLED RIGHT UP AND HE WAS LOADING HER UP WITH STUFF AND ALONGSIDE AND WE GOT CALLED AND PUT ABOARD HER AND THAT'S AS QUICK AS THAT I'LL TELL YOU THE BLOKE THAT WAS WITH ME HE DIED OF THREE WEEKS AGO AND WE BOTH TOGETHER YOU SEE WE BOTH TOOK THE COURSE TOGETHER IN EVERYTHING AND WE STUCK TOGETHER AND WE BOTH GOT PUT ON TO THE SAVAGE SHE CAME IN IN THE AFTERNOON AND PULLED ALONGSIDE AND IT WAS MURDER THEY WERE HAVING ALL SORTS OF THINGS BECAUSE WE GOT A RACE UP WITH THIS BIG CONVOY WAS COMING FROM CANADA THERE WAS LOADS UP IN SCOTLAND WAITING FOR THE CONVOY TO ME AND THIS IS HOW WE KNEW IT ANYWAY A POINT FOR US TO AND WE WENT ON TO THE WHERE THEY TELL YOU WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND THEY SENT US STRAIGHT TO THE SAVAGE IN THE DOCKYARD WHAT THE SAVAGE WAS HAVING TO DO WAS TAKE ON AMMUNITION AND EVERYTHING ELSE AND IT WAS POURING A BLOODY RAIN THAT NIGHT IT ROCKETED DOWN AND WE HAD TO GO DOWN FURTHER DOWN THE COAST BECAUSE WE JOINED IT ONCE WE WENT ON WE WERE THERE FOR EVER WE'D BEEN DRAFTED TO HER WHICH WAS ALL RIGHT WE WENT DOWN TO DARK I WENT DOWN TO THE AMMUNITION PLACE WHICH WAS A LONG WAY DOWN THE WATER FROM US IT WAS POCKETING DOWN GOD BLOW HAD AMMUNITION SHIP IN IN THE DARK YOU WENT ALONG THE PIPE NOT PIPES BOARDS AND THEY WERE SPRINGING UP AND DOWN CARRYING STUFF OUT AND POURING RAIN PITCH BLACK AND THE SHIP WAS SHIPPING WATER IT WAS RAINING SO HARD WE WERE ALL CARRYING STUFF ALONG THE LANDING TO FILL HER UP WITH AMMUNITION AND THAT AND WE SAILED FROM THERE AT MIDNIGHT THROUGH BETWEEN LAND AND THAT TO JOIN THIS BIG CONVOY YOU NEVER SEE IT RAIN LIKE IT GOD ALMIGHTY AND I WAS A LOOKOUT AND THE MATE WITH THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE AND A LOOKOUT AND IT WAS BLOODY SOAKED IN THE SKIN PITCH BLACK OF COURSE WE HAD TO PUT ALL NEW AMMUNITION ON AND BEFORE WE COULD SAIL FROM THERE BECAUSE THAT WAS THE AMMUNITION DOWN THERE ANYWAY WE GOT UP IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE MORNING WE REACHED LIVERPOOL IN THAT AREA AND THEN IT STARTED LIGHTING UP A BIT BUT IT NEVER LEFT OFF DRIVING RAIN AND WE WENT RIGHT THE WAY UP TO THE NORTH WHERE WE GOT TO PICK THIS CONVOY UP AND THEY WERE ALL MORE OR LESS READY TO SAIL IT WAS THE BIGGEST CONVOY OF THE WAR AND EVERY TYPE SHIP WAS THERE COURSE WE JOINED HER I 'D NEVER BEEN IN THE BLOODY SEA YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHERE YOU WERE BECAUSE WE HADN'T BEEN TRAINED FOR IT IT WAS TOO QUICK BUT ANYWAY WE MANAGED MY MATE FIRST THING YOU WERE ALL MIXED UP BECAUSE THE SHIP WAS SHIPPING WATER ALL THE WAY UP I WENT DOWN INTO THE FRONT OF THE SHIP IT WAS HALF FULL OF BLOODY WATER AND IT KEPT SWINGING FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER IT WAS SHIPPING IT OVER THE TOP YOU SEE ONE OF THE WORST STORMS OF THE WAR UP THAT COAST AND ANYWAY MIND ADMITTING IT I FELT IT SICK GOING UP TO RUSSIA I WASN'T TOO BAD GOING UP THROUGH THE CHANNEL AS I SAID BUT WHEN WE ACTUALLY GOT GOING I THOUGHT QUITE BLAME I GOT BILLETED BUT THEY HADN'T GOT ROOM FOR US DOWN IN THE MAIN PLACE AND I THOUGHT I FELT SICK AS A DOG SO I CLEARED MYSELF AND THEY GOT THE GUN TURRET TURN FOREHEAD LOOKING FOREHEAD IT WAS OPEN TO THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING ON THE BACK OF THE GUN SHIELD AND IT HAD CURTAINS HEAVY CURTAINS THAT WOULD GO OVER BECAUSE THERE WAS NO DOORS OR NOTHING BEHIND AND I SLEPT THERE ALL NIGHT I DID THE REST OF THE NIGHT I DID FEEL ILL AND MY MATE HE WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE WENT BUT I WAS NEVER SICK AGAIN SICK THEN I FELT SICK I NEVER LIKE IT AGAIN BUT I'D ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD SWIMMER AND DIVER I DO EVEN WHY THAT SHOULD UPSET ME LIKE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW BUT I STOPPED UP THERE UNTIL WE GOT TWO DAYS AWAY FROM YOU MIGHT SAY AND I NEVER LOOKED BACK THE SAVAGE WAS A ONE OFF SHIP SHE WASN'T GOT A DEPTH UNDER WATER LIKE THE UP AND DOWN ENGINE ONES SHE HAD ELECTRIC TURBINES STEAM TURBINES MADE ALL THE ELECTRIC BUT SHE DIDN'T DRAW HALF AS MUCH WATER AS AN ORDINARY DESTROYER OR AN ORDINARY SLOOP WAS PROVED ON THE LAST DAY OF THE WAR THE CONVOY AND WE WERE ALL WAITING AROUND OUTSIDE TO GO THROUGH THE MOUNTAIN GAP TO THE RUSSIAN END A U BOAT WAS WAITING FOR US AND WE WERE ALL THERE THE CONVOY WAS COMING IN TO TELL YOU SOMETIMES CONVOY WAS COMING IN AND SPREADING ABOUT THE GERMANS WERE WAITING UNDERNEATH THE CLIFF BOTTOMS YOU COULD ONLY GO INTO THE DOCKYARD THROUGH AN ENTRANCE NOT MUCH WIDER THAN THAT WITH TWO GREAT PILLARS OF COASTLINE SO YOU HAD A ONE AT A TIME AND THE BIG LIBERTY SHIPS USED TO SQUEEZE THROUGH IT THIS WAS THE LAST CONVOY OF THE WAR WE WERE HANGING ABOUT THERE THE SHIPS THAT WERE COMING IN WITH STUFF TO SET TAKE IN THIS U BOAT WAS LAYING UNDER THE ROCKS OPPOSITE US IT WAS SNOWING IN THE MORNING WHEN WE TOOK UP THEIR POSITION TO THEY COME IN BECAUSE THEY GOT LIBERTY SHIPS WITH THEM WITH RAILWAY ENGINES ON THEM AND THAT FROM AMERICA AND THE FIRST THING THAT HAPPENED ONE OF THEM GOT A TORPEDO IT TO GO THROUGH THE OPENING INTO THE HARBOUR WHERE YOU TO IT NOBODY COULD GET THROUGH IT BECAUSE THE SHIP BROKEN OFF AND SUNK IN THE GATEWAY IT A GATEWAY COURSE THAT'S COS THEN BECAUSE THE REST OF THE FLOTILLA OF AIR FLOTILLA AND PEOPLE COPIED TO BRING UP WERE COMING INTO THIS BIG OPENING WHERE WE WERE ALL WAITING FOR OTHERS TO GO IN AND WE WERE ALL READY FOR EVERYTHING ME AND MY MATE WERE PUT DOWN BELOW TO PUSH WHAT'S HER NAME DEPTH CHARGES OR COME ON AND THEN THEY WERE PULLING THEM UP READY TO GO HEARD IT ALL WE HEARD A TORPEDO COMING I DIDN'T BUT THE OTHERS ON DECK DID THEY COULD HEAR IT COMING BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT WERE AND IT WENT UNDER THE SAVAGE THE BRAND NEW SHIP JUST AS FAR AWAY AS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD AND EVERYBODY WAS PRACTICALLY KILLED ON IT IT SUNK LIKE THAT BRAND NEW WHY DIDN'T IT HIT THE SAVAGE SHALLOW DRAFT SHALLOW DRAFT HAD FLAT ENGINES THAT WERE DRIVEN BY SHAFTS THAT WAY NOT OUT AT THE BOTTOM AND THEY DROVE THESE TWO GENERATORS GO DOWN ONE OF MY JOBS USED TO GO DOWN EVERY MORNING AND CHECK ALL THE THINGS THAT COULD HAVE STOPPED IT AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING THAT WAS ONE OF MY JOBS I USED TO STAND THERE AND WATCH THE BECAUSE WHAT THEY WERE THERE 'S NO PROPELLERS AS THEY WERE ON THE BIGGER SHIPS WHICH WERE LOW DOWN WEREN'T THEY WERE AND IT WAS ONLY DRAWING HALF AS MUCH WATER AS ONE OF THEM AND THAT TORPEDO WENT UNDER US AND HIT THE OTHER SHIP THE OTHER SIDE PICKED SOME OF THE MEN SIX WE BURIED ONE BEFORE WE WENT IN A DARK WE WERE FIGHTING UNTIL DARK OUT THERE ALL THE REST OF THE SHIPS YOU SEE WE THIS LIBERTY SHIP HIT IT WITH A TORPEDO AND IT BLOCKED THE ENTRANCE YOU SEE IT WENT DOWN IN THE ENTRANCE HOW DID YOU GET RID OF THAT YOU REMEMBER I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE IT WAS UP TO THE RUSSIANS TO DO THEIR OWN WORK AND THAT WE WERE FIGHTING UNTIL DARK THAT NIGHT AND IT WAS SNOWING AT EIGHT IN THE MORNING WHEN WE STARTED UNTIL IT GOT DARK AND IN FACT WE BURIED ONE CHAP IT WAS QUITE DUSK GETTING DARK AND WE BURIED HIM AND THEN WE HAD TO GO RIGHT UP NORTH FURTHER TO COME IN ANOTHER WAY FROM THE NORTH AND DOWN INSIDE THE WATER COULDN'T GET IN YOU SEE IT WAS TERRIBLE IT WAS THE LAST CONVOY THE WAR WHEN WE CAME OUT THEY'D OPENED UP THE RUSSIANS ME IT WAS CHRISTMAS WE HAD CHRISTMAS DAY THERE AND FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AND WHEN WE COME OUT WE COULD COME OUT THAT WAY WE CAME OUT AT MIDNIGHT TWO OF US WE HAD TO GO NORTH RUN UP THE COAST LINE AND THE OTHER ONE WE WENT SOUTH AND THE OTHER ONE WENT NORTH LISTENING FOR U BOATS AND WHILE WE WERE THERE WE WERE DROPPING THE CONVOY WAS READY TO COME OUT THAT WAS COMING OUT EMPTIES READY TO COME OUT AND WE WERE SENT EACH WAY AND THE OTHER ONE TO KEEP ANYTHING YOU AND TRY AND FIND IF ANYTHING WAS THERE WELL WE WERE DOING THIS THE CONVOY CAME OUT IN THE PITCH BLACK AND BY THE TIME IT GOT LIGHT IN THE MORNING THEY WERE WELL AWAY FROM WHERE WE WERE WE HAD TO SCRATCH UP AND CATCH HER UP YOU SEE WHICH WE DID AND WE CAME HOME ALL RIGHT WE NEVER HAD NO PROBLEMS AFTER THE CONVOYS OF THE ARCTIC AND I MEAN YOU DIDN'T STAY ON A SAVAGE VERY LONG DID YOU WELL I STAYED ON THE SAVAGE UNTIL THE GERMAN SURRENDER AND WE CAME BACK DOWN TO CHATHAM A BARRACKS AND THE DOCKYARD AND I WAS SENT FOR BECAUSE YOU SEE I WAS A VOLUNTEER I JOINED UNDER AGE HENCE IT MADE ME A VOLUNTEER NOT A CONSCRIPTED MAN WE CAME DOWN TO CHATHAM DOCKYARD I GOT SENT TO THE PLACE WHERE THEY HEADED YOU IN AND OUT HAD TO PACK MY KIT AND THE NEXT MORNING I WAS PUT ON A TRAIN WITH HUNDREDS MORE IN THE DOCKYARD LOCKED IN WITH KEYS AND THEY TAKE THEM OUT SO YOU CAN'T GET OUT AND THIS TRAIN WENT STRAIGHT OFF FLOWING DOWN TO SOUTHAMPTON OUT RUDDY GREAT LINE OF THERE WAITING FOR US ALL FULL OF PEOPLE GOING TO THE FAR EAST AND SHE WAS GOING TO SAIL AT HALF PAST EIGHT AND IT WAS HALF PAST SIX THEN AND YOU COULDN'T GET ON ANYWHERE FOR PEOPLE IT WAS A REALLY GREAT AMERICAN LINE CAN'T THINK OF THEIR NAME THEY WERE TWO OF THEM MADE ANYWAY WE SAILED THAT NIGHT WITHIN TWO HOURS WE WERE ON THE WATER GOING OUT AND THAT TOOK US RIGHT OUT TO SALON AND THAT'S WHERE WE TOOK OFF THERE I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE WENT FROM THERE BECAUSE SHE WAS LOADED TO THE TOP WE HAD TO STOP BEFORE WE COULD GO THROUGH THE CANAL TO GET TO GET OUT TO THE BOTTOM END BECAUSE THE TIME WE GOT THERE IT WAS PITCH BLACK WENT ON FROM THERE DOWN THE NEXT MORNING THROUGH THE CANAL SHE WAS SUCH A BIG SHIP AND THE NEXT THING WE WENT RIGHT OUT TO SALON AND THAT'S WHERE THEY BUMPED US OFF WAS THERE DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING OF THAT TROOP SHIP THERE WAS NO BLOODY ROOM FOR US WE HAD TO BE ON THE TOP DECK IT WAS BLOWING A GALE WAS BLOODY GALE AND ALL OUR HAD BEEN LEFT DOWN BELOW WHERE IT WAS DUMPED GOT LOADS OF WOMEN ON THERE IN UNIFORM AND THAT WE HAD TO SLEEP ON THE TOP DECK IT WAS BLOODY FREEZING IT WAS BUT WE WENT THROUGH THE CANAL AND WENT RIGHT OUT THEN STRAIGHT OUT TO SALON AND THEY DUMPED US PRETTY INCREDIBLE REALLY WHEN YOU THINK ONE MINUTE YOU WERE IN THE EARLY OR IN A BAR AND THEN IT'S LATE THAT'S A QUICK AT WORK THEY WERE WAITING FOR TROOPS YOU SEE AND SHE WAS FULL A SHIP THERE WAS TWO ON THEM THEY HAD TWO OF THEM DID YOU HAVE ANY FEAR OF GOING TO THE FAR EAST NO I DIDN'T WHAT IT WAS LIKE DID I DON'T MEAN I HAD ANY SLIDING IT MIGHT BE BELOVED BUT I DIDN'T EVER I WANTED IT YOU SEE THAT'S WHY I RUN AWAY AND JOINED THE NAVY YOUNG I WANTED THE NAVY AND WHEN THAT ALL CAME I MEAN I WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD SHE WAS A NICE SHIP BUT I'D NEVER DONE ANY MIND SWEEPING IN AND SHE WAS NOT IN THE CHATHAM A SHIP YOU SEE EVERYBODY ELSE WAS GOING ON LIKE A FIRE THERE'S ONE BLOKE AND HE WAS IN THE SAME MESS AS ME HE USED TO SIT OPPOSITE ME AT THE TABLE AND I DON'T KNOW WHY HE TOOK A TOOK TO ME BUT ANYWAY HE FOUND OUT THAT I WOULD A CHATHAM MAN AND THAT WAS WHAT A THING STARTED I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE REALLY BUT EVERYBODY ELSE WE WERE LIKE BRICKS TOGETHER WHERE WE USED TO GO DOWN TO SLEEP BELOW IF WE GOT ANY DANGER WE USED TO OPEN THE LOW DOWN DOWN THERE YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER MESS DECK YOU HANG YOUR HAMMOCKS DOWN THERE IF YOU CAN AND HE WAS IN THE SAME MESS WITH ME SITTING OPPOSITE ME HE JUST USED TO SNEER AT ME I NEVER HAD A BLOODY ENEMY ON THAT SHIP THEY MADE ME CHIEF QUARTERMASTER HE DIDN'T LIKE THAT YOU SEE A COURSE THAT GIVE ME QUITE A RUN AS A SHIP AND THEN THE CAPTAIN HE HAD ME OFF HIS CABIN AND HAD A CHAT WITH ME AND TOLD ME WHAT HE LIKED ME TO DO IT WAS NICE I MEAN I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE STEERAGE WHICH MEANS THAT THE OTHER CHAPS WERE UNDER ME STRAIGHT AWAY I WON'T HAVE STEERED A BLOODY SHIP BUT I HAD TO IT AIN'T GOT A COMPASS LIKE WHERE YOU SEE THE HANDS GOING OUT YOU'VE GOT NUMBERS FLICKING BACKWARD AND FORWARD AND YOU TO READ AND WE DID HAVE ONE IN THE OLD WHAT ABOUT THIS SHIP THE JAPANESE SHIP YOU WERE ESCORTING TELL ME ABOUT THAT WELL THAT WAS THE BIGGEST OF THEIR CRUISERS IN DON'T ASK ME THE NAME I CAN'T TELL YOU IT WAS THE BIGGEST ONE THEY HAD AT THAT AND SHE HAD BEEN BOMBED AND SHE LAY IN THE HARBOUR WE USED TO GO BY HER EVERY TIME HE WENT IN AND OUT WE THOUGHT SHE WAS ON THE BOTTOM BUT SHE WASN'T ANYWAY IT WAS THE ONE OF THE JAPANESE SHIPS AND IT HAD BEEN BOMBED AND IT HAD BEEN IN SINGAPORE HARBOUR FOR QUITE SOME TIME SINCE IT WAS IT ANYWAY NOT WERE MAKING IT READY TO TOW IT AND SINK IT YOU SEE WE GOT CHOSE TO DO IT AND WE WERE COMING ON OUR WAY HOME AS IT HAPPENED WE LEFT SINGAPORE WITH HER WITH A TOGETHER WITH HER ACTUALLY SHE WAS A MASSIVE SHIP AND SHE'D BEEN EMPTIED EVERYTHING AND IT GOT DARK AND WE WERE COMING UP THE MALACCA STRAITS AND WE GOT TO THIS POINT WHERE SHE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN SUNK THE DEEPEST WATER BECAUSE SHE WAS THE BIGGEST ONE THEY HAD AT THE TIME AND CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS PITCH BLACK AND WE WERE ON OUR WAY COMING TO COME HOME YOU SEE IT COME TO MIDNIGHT AND JAPANESE TUGS WERE TOWING HER THAT HAD BEEN TOWING HER RODWELL AS FAR AWAY FROM US FURTHER THAN THE BIG AS THEY WERE FROM US THEY WERE COMING UP AGAIN THE COAST LYING AND WE WERE FURTHER OUT WHERE WE COULD KEEP OUR EYE ON EVERYTHING AND AS I SAY IT GOT PITCH BLACK AND BY THE TIME WE GOT TO THE POINT WE HAD A COMPASS READING WE GOT A SINKER ON THEY STARTED THE SHIP COMING UP AND LEFT HER THEY BOLTED AND LEFT THE SHIP HEADWAY AND SHE'D COME HALFWAY UP NEARLY TO WHERE SHE POSED TO HAD BEEN SUNK AND I EXPECT I DON'T KNOW WHAT EVER CAPTAIN GOT PERMISSION TO SINK HER BUT IT WAS MIDNIGHT PITCH BLACK AND WE HAD AIR SEARCH ON HER AND THEY VANISHED INTO BLACK AND GONE OF COURSE SHE DRIFTED WELL SHE WOULDN'T DRIFT FURTHER BECAUSE I MEAN SHE WAS A MASSIVE SHIP SHE WAS ONLY JUST OFF THE COAST LINE AS WE THOUGHT PITCH BLACK I'M STILL ON THE BLOODY WHEEL OF COURSE LOOKING AT THE WHEEL AS WELL BECAUSE WE WEREN'T GOING WE WERE JUST HOVERING I SUPPOSE THE CAPTAIN GOT IN TOUCH WITH PEOPLE AND THEY SAID WHAT TO DO SO WE HAD TO SEND MEN OVER WITH DEPTH CHARGES BECAUSE WE CARRIED DEPTH CHARGES AND THEY GOT TO PUT THE DEPTH CHARGES AS LOW AS POSSIBLE IN THE SHIP BECAUSE HERE WAS NOBODY ON THERE ON IT WERE MASSIVE AND THEY'D GO TO WAR EVERYTHING UP ALL WE COULD DO WAS USE THEIR DEPTH CHARGES AND AND TRY THEM THAT WAS ALL WE COULD DO WE DID WE DID IT IT WAS MIDNIGHT WHEN WE STARTED AND WE WERE DRIFTING A SPUR AWAY PERHAPS THE SAILS FROM HER AND OF COURSE THEY COULDN'T DO MUCH REALLY BECAUSE OUR MOTOR BOAT WENT OVER AND THEY TOOK THEY PUT FOUR DEPTH CHARGES IN HER IN THE MOTOR BOAT AND THAT'S ALL SHE HOLD YOU CARRY THEY TOOK THEM OVER FROM OFF OF US THEY WERE AIR CREW YOU SEE DOING IT AND WHATEVER THEY DONE THEY WENT ABOARD THE SHIP AND THEY TOOK THESE DEPTH CHARGES AS THE CAPTAIN SAID IT'S GOT TO BE DONE AND PUT THEM RIGHT DOWN IN THE LOWER END AS THEY COULD GET OF THE SHIP S I MEAN HE WAS A BLOODY MASSIVE SEEING AND THEY DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD AND FUSED EVERYTHING THAT WOULD EXPLODE CAME BACK TO US AND BANG SHE DID SHE WENT DOWN HE BLEW THE BOTTOM OUT AND SHE WENT DOWN OF COURSE WE NEVER SEE A MORE BECAUSE WE LEFT HER THERE SHE WASN'T TOO FAR OFF THE COAST AND SHE WASN'T TOO FAR FROM PENANG WE WERE GOING UP TOWARDS PENANG AND DID YOU SEE HER GOING DOWN THEN OH YEAH WE WATCHED HER WITH THEIR SEARCH LIGHTSPECIAL THING TO SEA WE ONLY ON WE SAW HER MORE OR LESS THE MAST WAS STICKING OUT THAT'S ALL SHE WAS STILL GOING SHE WAS STILL GOING DOWN PITCHED MEN PUT DEPTH CHARGES ALL THE WAY ALONG WHEN SHE GOT TO A CERTAIN DEPTH THEY OPENED THE DEPTH AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP TO LET THE WATER IN AND WE HAD TO SIT THERE UNTIL IT FILLED UP AND FIRED HIS CHARGES A BLOODY YOU NEVER SHOUT LIKE IT IT WAS FABULOUS OF COURSE WE WANTED TO LEAVE THEIR CAMERAS SO A BIT ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD MIND SWEEP A STORY ABOUT WHAT YOU DO HOW YOU DO IT WELL THERE THERE'S VARIOUS WAYS YOU CAN DO IT YOU CAN DO IT WITH THE WIRES OUT WITH FLOATS ON THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS YOU CAN PUT DEPTHS DOWN PUT THEM DOWN TO CERTAIN DEPTHS AND LEAVE THEM DOWN THERE WAITING THEM DOWN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT'S GOING TO BE OVER THEM AND THAT WHEN YOU COME BACK BUT BASICALLY YOU ONLY DO IT TO CLEAR THE OCEAN IN THE AIR YOU'RE IN AND IF THERE'S BEEN SHIPS COLLIDING WITH THEM WE'D GET SUNK OUT WE'D GET SENT OUT THERE TO SWEEP IT ANY NEAR MISSES WITH THE MINES WELL WE'VE HAD THEM COME UP BESIDE US YEAH I TOLD ME TO WHEN YOU WERE ALL JOINED TOGETHER A STRONG BOILERS YOU'RE IN A FORMATION LIKE THAT AND EACH SIDE GOES TO ANOTHER SHIP AND THEY GO OUT TO ANOTHER ONE AND THEN TO THE OTHER THEN YOU'VE GOT SEVEN YOU'RE THE ONE IN THE FRONT THAT'S PROBABLY MORE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU CAN SOUND THAN THE OTHERS SAY THEY DO THAT SORT OF THING THEY KEEP IMPROVING ON CERTAIN THINGS AND WE MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S HOW YOU SWEEP THAT SWEEP YOU'RE ALL OVER LATCH EACH OTHER AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY TIE YOU CALL GOT WIRES HOLDING YOU TOGETHER IN A POSITION IT'S ALL DONE FREE THEY THEY HAVE TO SIT THERE ON EACH SIDE OF YOU AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE AND THEN REVERSE FOR THE NEXT TO THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT THAT'S WHEN YOU DO THAT TYPE OF SWEEP BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS YOU CAN SWEEP AND WE USED TO DO IT SWEEPS WITH LONG WIRES WE HAD A GREAT BIG THING ON AIR QUARTER DECK IT WAS FULL OF HEAVY WIRE AND WE USED TO LET THAT OUT WITH THINGS ON THAT AND CAPTAIN ON THE BRIDGE LET GO THEN YOU STOP IT WHEN HE TELLS IT WAS A MASSIVE STACK OF WIRE ON A DRUM AND IT WAS NOT HEAVY WIRE YOU PUT ANYTHING ON THE END OF IT YOU SEE AND YOU CAN LET IT OUT AND IT WILL EXPLODE MINES I'LL FIND IF THERE'S ANY THERE YOU'LL KNOW WHERE YOU STAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER IF IT'S ON LUCK REALLY YOU CAN'T LOOK DOWN IN THE SEA BUT WE USED TO SNAG UP SNAGGED UP ON AN AIRPLANE DOWN THERE THAT CRASHED AND SO WE WERE TOLD IT WAS I DON'T KNOW I NEVER SEEN IT BUT I KNOW WHEN IT SNAGGED IT AND AROUND THE SHIP BUT IT WAS A PLANE BUT I DON'T KNOW KNEW CASE WE DIDN'T STOP YOU ALWAYS GOT SOMEBODY THAT MADE SOMETHING UP DIDN'T YOU YOU MENTIONED THIS ABOUT THIS THIS CHATHAM AND THE POMPEY RATING WHEN YOU SAY HE MADE CLIVE DIFFICULT WHAT DO YOU MEAN HOW DID HE DO THAT WHAT WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED WE COME HOME TO ENGLAND AND I HAD THE MOST OF THE TIME BECAUSE I USED TO GO UP AND SIT WITH THEM AND THEN I TAKE BECAUSE I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM YOU SEE SO THEY DIDN'T ALL HAVE A THING OR JUST TAKE IT YOU SEE ONE NIGHT DOING THAT I HAD TO BE A QUARTERMASTER WHICH MEANS WHEN WE WERE AT ANCHOR I HAD TO DO A DUTY AT THE BACK OF THE SHIP WHERE THEY COME IN AND OUT OF IT WHEN THEY CAN GO ASHORE AND ONE THING OR ANOTHER ALL THE LOG BOOKS THERE AND EVERYTHING I WAS ON DUTY THERE DOING MINE ALMOST COMING HOME AT THIS POINT AND I GOT A TERRIBLE THROAT AND COLD AND IT WAS POURING RAIN AND I HAD TO TAKE THE NOT WATCH AND I THOUGHT I GOT FEELING COLD AND I HADN'T TOOK MY OILSKINS OUT OF MY LOCKER BECAUSE THEY'D BEEN THERE SINCE I PUT THEM IN BEFORE WE WENT ABROAD I MEAN YOU DIDN'T HAVE HAVE MAIL AND I THOUGHT GOD I'VE GOT A GOOD AIR AND GET OILSKINS AND OF COURSE I'M STANDING IN AN OPENING WHERE YOU IN THAT SIDE WALK STRAIGHT OUT AND FALL OFF THE SHIP THE OTHER SIDE AT NO TIME THERE 'S AN OFFICER AND A CREW COME ROUND THE SHIPS AND THE CHECK FOR YOU'RE BEING LOOKED AFTER AND I WENT DOWN TO GET NIPPED DOWN BECAUSE I GOT THE DUTY WATCH TO GET MY OIL SKIN OUT AND I GOT A TERRIBLE COLD AND THIS CHAP SLUNG HIS HAMMOCK RIGHT ACROSS THE TOP OF THE OPENING WE HAD TO WALK DOWN THE STEP TO AND HE WAS SWINGING ABOUT IN HIS HAMMOCK COSTS ONE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND BE KNOWN TO ME THE BOAT COME ROUND AND SEEING THAT I WASN'T THERE DIDN'T CATCH NOTHING BUT HE TOLD THE CAPTAIN THAT I HAD BEEN DOWN IN THE LOCKER AND I WAS HAVING A JOB TO GET ME A THING OPEN BECAUSE IT ALL STOPPED TOGETHER BEING OUT IN THE HEAT OF COURSE WE NEVER WORE THEM YOU SEE THERE AND THE NEXT THING HE DROPPED ME IN IT AND HE WENT AND TOLD THE OFFICER OF THE DAY THAT I WAS GONE DOWN TO SLEEP AND I'M SITTING TRYING TO GET THIS BLOODY THING OPEN BECAUSE I GOT A LAZY COLD AND HE'D DONE THAT AND THE NEXT THING SENT FOR THE OFFICER OF THE DAY HE COME DOWN ON A CHARGE I HAD TO MEET THE CAPTAIN AND EVERYTHING AND THE CAPTAIN DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL BUT ANYWAY HE TOLD ME TO FORGET EVERYTHING YOU'RE MY MAN HE SAID NEVER MIND ABOUT HIM WE'VE HAD TROUBLE WITH HIM BEFORE I BROUGHT THE SHIP THE UP TO THE DOCKYARD DOWN SOUTH AND THE NEXT DAY I COME HOME HAD THREE DAYS LEAVE AND THEN I HAD TO GO BACK DOWN TO CHATHAM AGAIN OF COURSE THE MAN WE'RE ALL FINISHED YOU SEE THEN I WASN'T GOING TO LOVE GIVE ME A BLOODY DOSING I WENT TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND THEY SAID YOU'RE GOING UP TO SCOTLAND THERE IS A SHIP UP THERE YOU'RE GOING ON I SAID HOW AM I GOING TO GET THERE SAID IT'S ALL RIGHT AS TWO OTHER CHAPS COMING UP WITH YOU YOU'LL ALL BE GOING TOGETHER AND THAT WAS A BIG SHIP UP THERE AND OF COURSE SHE WAS ONLY ON LOAN TO THE WAR YOU SEE TO US LIKE A CANADIAN AND SHE WAS GOING TO GO HOME AND I WAS BILLETED ON HER THEY PUT US ON THERE TO SLEEP AND EVERYTHING AND FEED THERE WAS QUITE A FEW OF US AND WE SLEPT ON BOARD AND EVERYTHING BY THE TIME THEY WANTED TO TAKE HER HOME TO CANADA THEY SENT FOR ME AND WENT TO THE OFFICE AND I HAD A BIT OF A PROBLEM AND I HAD TO SEE THE DOCTOR AND THE BLOODY DOCTOR SAID I WASN'T FIT TO GO THEY PAID ME OFF THE DAY BEFORE IT SAILED AND I HAD TO COME OUT IN THE NAVY I'D GOT SOMETHING IN THE CHEST AND I HAD TO SEE THE DOCTOR AND HE SAID YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT FIT ENOUGH ANY MORE FOR A NAVY CHEEKY BOG
