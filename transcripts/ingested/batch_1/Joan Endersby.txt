my name is endersby i joined the wrns in nineteen forty three emily joan but i was emily joan williams in those days ok joan you talk to me not the camera just a one on one conversation basically well where are you from and what was life like for you up to and during the early part of the war do you mean in private or before i went in the wrns before you went i lived in liverpool right through the bombing and those days i was determined to be a wren i volunteered the day i was seventeen and a half in liverpool and was in before i was eighteen well i'll ask you about the wrns what do you remember of the bombing because liverpool was hit very badly wasn't it yes very badly but we were very fortunate all we ever had was one of the balloons fastened round the chimney pot apart from that that was all we had wrong with us we were very lucky indeed because we lived five miles out of liverpool so that made it a lot easier for safety's sake are there any stand out memories from the bombing no except falling down the stairs and getting up and muttering horribly going down to the air raid shelter at the bottom of the garden and you know do you have many brothers and sisters what was your family make up my father was in the liverpool city police and every night we had a bomb bomb raid he was on duty on the docks i had one sister why do you think you had an attraction for the wrns over the other services i knew it was the best service to go into why do you think you knew that well we'd been told often enough you know very very difficult to get into the wrns and it was i couldn't bear i thought i might have got called up eventually and i couldn't bear the thought of going in the munitions factory or even worse in the land army but i always wanted to be a wren i don't really know why what year was it when you were seventeen and a half and you became a wren what year was that nineteen forty three nineteen forty three was that when they had this new draft sort of another call out for wrens oh no very seldom saw an advert for the wrns to join and i was told you could only be a steward or a cook but the day i went i think i might have impressed the officer in charge because nobody ever mentioned doing jobs like that when i went i was a teleprinter operator what is said ok well look just talk me through a little bit about you know what happens after you've been accepted as a wren just talk a little bit about those the early training and those first few weeks of becoming a wren what do you remember of it well as i say it must have been in may that i volunteered and in september i got called up went to london to mill hill which had been taken over by the navy and we were up a five o'clock in the morning scrubbing steps i think they wanted to make sure we were the right type to be accepted by them and also in those days if i didn't like the wrns or they didn't like me i could come home with no stain on the old character but they spent all their time telling us we were far superior to anybody else and if we deserted we were not taken back we were out completely it was a wonderful service to be in i wouldn't have missed a day of it and i mean had you been out of liverpool much as a young girl no so what was that journey like to london what was it like telling your mum and dad and leaving the house well if my grandmother had been alive i'd never have been allowed to go she wouldn't have let me but my father gave me permission and do you know i can't remember whether i wasn't scared about it i knew there would be transport at the other end for me to start the training then after two weeks i went to westfield college in hampstead and there we learned how to be teleprinter operators and it was in a lovely part of hampstead and at the bottom of the road was the house in which konrad weiss the old german film star had lived and it was all taken over with teleprinters and switchboards that kind of thing and from there i went up to i was there for about until november then i went to blundell sands hotel in liverpool which was a holding depot and from there on christmas eve nineteen forty three i ended up in londonderry an i we lived in a hut and i opened the door of this hut there were six huts for the watch keepers i opened the door of this hut which was a two piece door and it had all the decorations up and little counterpanes with the wrns crest on them and i was totally and completely at home i never missed home once they were a great crowd of girls i wouldn't i never heard anybody i never knew anybody who ran away or deserted i never remember anybody falling out with everybody the biggest regret i've got is i was so young i didn't realise what a good job i'd got because fortunately by the end of forty three the battle of the atlantic was very nearly won although there were still u boats hanging around we once had a destroyer escort back after leave but we knew every day where every convoy was from derby house in liverpool on the teleprinters and sworn to secrecy and of course all the girls wanted to know when their boyfriends were coming and we were not allowed to tell although we knew and i lived in this big old house on the shores of loch foyle and had a little lighthouse on a little pier so whenever i knew they were coming or going we could go down and wave and in that book i told you about when they all went when the canadians left for good boom hall turned out and there were tears and you know it really was but fortunately the war had ended and they were going home which was much better for them but it was a canadian escort all the time i was there when did you know that you were going to be doing that rather than stewardship or cooks was it cooks in mill hill when we were posted we were told where we were going and was your draft all going to teleprinters or were some of them off to stewardship etc what is said i don't i can't remember any of the others i don't there was nobody from liverpool that i knew going there although there could well have been because i didn't know ok and what are you actually learning when you're in hampstead what is it your actually trying to learn about a teleprinter well just how to manipulate them because they were electrical of course you have to learn how to time yourself on them but it was very simple really very noisy yes and what sort of stuff is it you're actually doing on it well the convoys in and out or if there was an emergency but whenever we had emergencies the coders or the cipher queens that was the officers it was always in codes so we didn't know well we knew something was wrong especially before d day we were working three shifts for d day so after hampstead you're then going back home basically yes to blundell sands hotel which was a holding depot where you stayed until there was a place for you wherever you were going to end up were you able to go home no we had to live in blundell sands yes you could go home when you had time off so were you able to show your mum and dad your wrns outfit yes yes i mean if you've never been out of liverpool obviously you've experienced a bit of london what do you remember of london did you get into the west end or very occasionally a young cousin of mine was in the air force and he came to london at the weekend and we went out to lyon's corner houses in those days but otherwise no we were too we were really very busy we were kept occupied all the time ok and from just describe the blundell sands hotel then and what it was like very large hotel rather posh the north end of liverpool on the way to southport is it still there i believe it still is but i'm not sure ok and you're waiting there essentially for a draft yes yes working though we were doing domestic work they kept us at it and how what do you know when you're given your draft does it say where you're going and what did you actually know at the time yes i knew i was going to londonderry and the family had said they didn't care where they sent me even scapa flow provided they didn't send me to ireland and of course that was where i ended up just so i think you've mentioned earlier just describe the wrennery for me this big old house going down to lough foyle in the big old house i believe it was one of general alexander's family homes it wasn't a mansion but it was a big house and all the day workers lived in the house and the watch keepers lived in huts one to six and i was in hut two and how many women in hut two about ten quite big yes beautifully warm an oil stove in the middle of the floor and they were very nice girls describe a normal day for me then so you wake up in the morning in hut two what sort of time or are you working shifts well there were three four watches morning till midnight and then the next day you're off until evening you went for the evening watch and three watches of course when things got hectic ok and just in terms of describe your job then what are you doing well just going down with in a big wooden hut more into londonderry itself we used to have big army trucks to take us in and there were about four teleprinters and the switchboard and the officers the cipher officers lived upstairs and you just went in and all the machines were rattling away you had to sign sign them off when they'd finished their calls coming in all from derby house we knew where all the convoys were in the atlantic ocean can you try and describe you know what information you're getting or sending that enables you to understand convoy positions well it was in ordinary ordinary english very long lists like this because all the convoys you see them going up each day going up further then they'd go off because they'd be in halifax or st john's and then you'd see them coming back again when you say you see them how do you see them because of the messages they're sending yes yes convoy abc one two three that kind of thin and it would send you its position would it yes yes and were you able to understand the positions or was that in code i would think a lot of it was in code and all the important messages all the secret messages always came in code or cipher and did you did the machine make a different noise yes when it came in as a secret message yes when it came they're lying quite quietly and then there's a rumble and they start and you have make sure that the paper's completely you know free the paper won't be held up but long long lists like this would come out ok so you're not actually doing typing as such oh yes when i'm sending back yes you had to send out messages and then you just signed them on the bottom with your initials are there any messages that you recall specifically that you either sent or received only when there was trouble fortunately as i say the battle of the atlantic was nearly over at the end of forty three we'd sort of got them under control which was a blessing did you see codes where convoys would you know go out with lots and come back with less no you didn't see exactly what the position was how many merchant ships went down it was more the merchant ships than the royal navy ships what did you know of d day we didn't know anything about it except that we were on three watches and appallingly busy the machines never stopped working day and night and we knew something was up but of course it was secret until d day actually happened then of course we heard on the news that they'd made the invasions had started but actually the actual thing itself the only way we ever knew about anything was if you went to the cinema and saw it on the newsreel we were quite isolated in that way you know i don't ever remember listening to a radio we got on with our job that was the most important thing just getting on with our job just describe what you were doing and why you knew what you were doing was important well we knew it was a very important job coming over from it came out from derby house in liverpool which was the headquarters of western approaches and the teleprinter i went to the teleprinter rooms and they're just like very large typewriters but rattling away and these convoys each day we knew where the convoys were until they went off the map altogether you know they got to halifax or st john's and then after a while you see them all coming back again which was wonderful and sworn to secrecy about it of course because although the battle of the atlantic was very nearly over there was still a little bit of activity with the u boats but if anything came in like that it was all in code or cipher so we knew it was important like for d day we knew it was important but we didn't know what was being said or done and when you got a sort of you know you could see what was happening with a convoy but certain messages would be different how did you react differently to different messages well if we knew what they were you know if it was in english if it was printed out sad i suppose worried sometimes if we knew there was a bit of activity out there there was nothing we could do about it just take a note of it and then if you had a coded message you'd give that to somebody else to the coders or ciphers to the officers something else i haven't asked you about is in terms of you've talked a bit about either sending messages either out or to derby house just explain the code books and what you you know how did you do what you did we never saw the code books obviously but it would just be given to us a load of numbers or a load of figures if i remember rightly the coders were four letters and lots of them and we just had to type them into liverpool liverpool only and then with the others it would be in figures the same again but we wouldn't know what it was about so you were given a sheet of paper were you yes with the numbers on and were they written or were they typed do you know i can't remember i think they would be written because it was the coders doing them yes i think it would be written just tell me a bit what it was like to be living in derry what do you remember of the city very poor city in those days crowded with naval personnel lots of little children with no shoes on saying give us a parney give us a parney' yes it was a poor city the maiden city it was never conquered and we were about four miles out of town and did you go into the city much oh yes all the time so tell me about some of the entertainment that you did then well there was the guildhall where they had innumerable dances all the time and everybody everybody got a chance to dance because there were so many men compared with so few women any dances that stand out no not really i met all my boyfriends my father was a christian scientist and there was a christian science reading room in the diamond and that's where i met all my boyfriends they were the kind of men who were looking for that kind of off duty entertainment they had rooms there where they could just sit quietly write their letters home or just relax it was run by an australian lady who couldn't get home because of the war coming and that's where i met all my boyfriends that's nice so what is it sort of like a church no it was just a room it was taken over by a shop there's no not christian science never took over well it's never taken over in this country has it in those days it was a very small very small concern but it was only sort of boys who knew about it that went into the rooms it was just a large shop made out with as much comfort as they could get you know they could read there or take me out the type of so when you say young boys are you talking about canadian american sailors or mostly canadians very occasionally there was american soldiers american sailors came in but very seldom it was nearly all canadians ok and would they talk to you about what they'd experienced on their sailings no no they just in that book i was telling you about they said just coming up lough foyle' and the greenery and the peace and know that they were safe until they went out again and having somewhere to go to and i had other very good friends in derry and i used to go to them a great deal there wasn't the shortage of food there that there was at home and on many a sunday night i've seen a crowd a real crowd of people singing round the piano and i didn't realise then that is what they needed you know to get away from the war and living in close quarters with the other sailors and hearing about what they were getting up to you know i think it was good for them but i didn't appreciate it enough at that time it's easy to see it with hindsight yes and what just talk a bit more about some of the young men you met then and what was entertainment in derry for you as a young girl being taken out and escorted what is said going for a meal or going to the cinema there were two or three cinemas we used to go there not very often going to dances but they really just wanted to be the friends i made just wanted to have a bit of peace you know and if you were there they would always take me out with them out for a meal or even for a good long walk in the countryside yes that's the kind of things they wanted most of all and what was it like for you to say goodbye to these young men when you knew that they were going out again not very funny you got used to it in the end though but all of them came back thank god all the ones the friends i knew all came back ok so just tell me who is this couple that were very nice to you and was it nice to the wrns in general no no it was mainly through the christian science church this is where i met them and then i took them to the adairs' and they were always very made very very welcome always there was another wren who was very friendly with them and she through the church as well and she was a p o and yes and how did you know that there was a christian science church there my father told me he said find the christian science organisation over there' there was no church as such he said and that's where you'll find your friends' that's nice advice yes you know what life was like seventy odd years ago it was totally different to where it is today they were the kind of boyfriends after going and coming back and going and coming back said may i kiss you goodnight ' you know nowadays you have to fight them off after a chip butty don't you it was a totally a totally different world and also being so young i think i was the youngest one on the base being so young the other girls they didn't have to keep an eye on me but you know they were very concerned about where i went and why do you remember what you ate as a wren basic food yes basic food that would get us home fish and chips or a roast meat and at christmas they did their best to because there were all cooks in the wrns as well the quartermaster quarter officer was a very good woman we had to be in at ten o'clock at night or ten thirty if you had a late pass you really were you really were looked after but fortunately in derry being so far from home when we were off duty we were allowed to wear civvies all the time except when we were absolutely on definitely on duty you had to wear uniform but we used to wear civvies when we were off duty and some nights going to boon hall from the road there was quite a long drive down the cars on a friday saturday night it was just it really was a party it was wonderful well i mean you know i think i've read that there were like twenty thousand sailors there there's a local lady population then there's the glamorous wrens it's no wonder you were in demand but you know they were lying four abreast the ships they were only small ships corvettes and destroyers and frigates mainly and yes it was and were these british navy ships or were these yes but the navy came back in force when the war ended but that's something i can tell you about the u boats what is said yes we'll come onto that i mean describe the harbour at derry you know and the amount of merchant ships you'd get in and stuff it was very small i think it's less wide than the river mersey is as i say they were all lined up there was very little room there was a bridge over to ebrington barracks where we used to have to go for divisions and exercise you know marching and that kind we didn't get much of that though and of course you had to go to church parade once a month and that was in derry cathedral and they always played the londonderry air and when at my cremation i've said when they're coming out they've got to play the londonderry air when i'm gone that's nice did you like divisions then if you're from christian science oh yes yes yes they don't believe in drink or smoking were you a smoker or a drinker i is it off no it's recording well you can if you do use anything i've said you can put it into your own way can't you you don't have to do the whole thing do you i'll take little bits out yes that's what i mean yes what was i going to say i've forgotten you were talking about your forty a day habit well i was brought up you will not smoke you will not drink and don't bring any little bundles home here ' life you know you were told to be quiet you were but so did you smoke never never smoked a cigarette in my life never drank no oh drink well only when i was about twenty and then well hardly ever hardly ever and i don't drink now well i say don't drink now most favourite of all is benedictine in coffee after dinner well that's what kept you young and alive i'm sure well and not having children too and i've worked always with young people and i think that keeps you going as well and i hope i've got a liverpool sense of humour too you have you have i must tell you this i think i know you well enough to tell you this when we were issued with our uniforms in mill hill got the shirts tie the lot and we were issued with three pairs of the most appalling bloomers you could ever see elastic round the waist legs in them with elastic round the legs you wouldn't have been seen dead in them everybody and we had to keep them because very very occasionally there was a kit inspection but we called them harvest festivals' all was safely gathered in don't put that i'm afraid that will definitely be in did you learn about you know the canadians and americans that you were seeing a lot of did they talk about what they were transporting did you have a sense of the significance of a convoy through what you learned well as churchill said it was the one battle he was terrified of losing because if we'd lost the battle of the atlantic we would have been finished and they were bringing over foodstuffs and ammunition that kind of thing on the little ships with the escorts there was nothing it was just the ship itself and the men on it guarding the convoys who were the canadians that you were meeting then these were the guys on the escort ships yes yes ah i didn't realise so there was a canadian navy helping the escort the canadian navy did a very great deal you don't hear about is as much but yes they were all canadians on the st thomas and the humber stone all those ships talk to me about what's next on your list because i've kind of exhausted my standard questions and i might have some others i've got on the top about the bombs and why it wasn't let me ask you about that then because actually derry one of the pictures of derry are of a city you know almost like a party city with balloons all over the place no we didn't even have those only in liverpool but in derry there was never an air raid and i can't imagine why except that four miles was the free state and when the ships went out they went past the donegal coast so they knew when the convoys were coming and going how did it feel to be part of something like the official secrets act during the war did it well this is why i say i was too young to appreciate the good job i'd got you know you were sworn to secrecy and then everything that came in code you either gave it to the wrens or if it was in figures or the other way round the officers did it no officers lived with us only the quartermaster officer you know the lady in charge of us all would you know individual ships on the convoy or would you just know of a specific numbered convoy a specific number do you mean the convoy itself the merchant ships and everything no we never knew how big the convoys were so every every sort of you know might be three or four corvettes would go out of derry and they'd just be on convoy ten yes yes and you'd know that convoy ten would go out and convoy ten would come back yes yes but they'd come into liverpool or glasgow these big ships must have been pretty horrible coming in when liverpool was being bombed to see them coming back in mustn't it they were hard days weren't they most significant thing is when the war ended british ships went to norway and brought back some of the u boats and they were berthed further up loch foyle quite near derry and fortunately unfortunately that day i was on duty i wasn't allowed to go and see them coming in and the cinc of western approaches was admiral sir max horton who was a splendid man and i'm told i didn't see this happen but i'm told when this captain of the u boats one of the u boats came off the ship put out his hand and max horton just stood there wouldn't shake his hand then i went on a u boat and they were pretty grim water dripping off them and rusty then when the war ended all of them were taken out into the north of the irish sea and scuttled yeah what do did you meet some of the germans the sailors that were on the u boats no no they'd been taken off yes yes quite a sinister thing to have got into i'd have thought yes yes yes you must i mean dreadful though they were it's awful when you think of being down there being depth charged it's a pretty terrible death were you impacted by the war personally you know did you suffer at the time emotionally anything happen to you no i came through with all my family still alive and no damage looking back i think i should have stayed in the wrns i think it would have suited me i'd have ended up a crusty old p o giving them hell why did you come out well because i'd met my husband who was on one of the ships that went to norway to bring the u boats back to ireland and i married in forty eight you know what do you remember of the end of the war and ve day and then what happened next for you there wasn't a great deal happening i mean like in london it was absolutely wonderful why everybody went mad everybody was very pleased and we were in derry and there were concerts and dances that kind of thing but much quieter much quieter they didn't really the population didn't really you know they'd never been bombed i think once bombs were dropped on them but only once ever which is something that always amazed me so you feel that they sort of apart from the fact that their city was overtaken by sailors they were aloof to the armed the war yes a lot of them not all of them obviously because lots of lots of men from over the border came over to this country and joined the forces and the demob process what do you remember of it and what did you do next well i went for the signals officer until my time came to go and i think i got twenty nine pound for my and you went home in your uniform and that was it but i don't it was missing your friends all the other girls were going bit by bit you know the older ones went sort of before me the ones that had been in longer then me seemed to go out before me which was fair enough but no it was it was i was very sad that it was over but that's very not a nice thing to say when so many people suffered so badly in the war and you reflect on your wren time now only recently only recently i joined the wrns association this summer i didn't know there was one many many years ago in chester and then about four months ago there was a wrns association in chester and i went and joined and i went for our christmas lunch yesterday and i was a bit scared i was going to be the oldest one there one lady beats me but it's amazing how it's so easy to talk about the old days and everyone everyone you can speak speak well of it how they loved it how they wouldn't have missed a day of it i never knew anybody who was unhappy oh perhaps if their boyfriend wasn't there or something he'd been moved perhaps somewhere else or didn't come into derry any more or he was perhaps in the army or the air force but in the main yes all right well i think we've probably that's about it joan is it of use to you nah i'm going to bin it no it was a lovely interview thank you
