ok well let's move the story on well i'll talk about the convoys now because you see that was in a sense it wasn't as bad as being in a convoy under constant attack because we were torpedoed and then that was it we were in the boats we had problems in the boats and so on we had all those difficulties but on a couple of occasions we were under attack for four days in almost a semi storm by u boats and ships were being blown up all round us you didn't get any sleep hardly because it was four on and four off and then you had to relieve people for their meals as well so you hardly got any time to have a rest and people's nerves are on edge you know and if a door jams you thought you've been torpedoed with people jumping up the most dramatic moment i think was when the last ship in the convoy line was usually designated rescue ship' to pick up survivors from those ahead that had been you know in the boats and one of the ships in our line was the empire shackleton' it's in my book it was torpedoed so we stopped to help it were you the rescue ship yes we were the last ship in line at that time and we stopped to rescue this ship and there were submarines all around and we thought any moment we were going to be hit too because the engine was stopped everything was stopped you see we were telling them to hurry up to come across so one lifeboat got off the ship and came across and we picked up the people on it and then we saw people running around on the ship with torches looking over the bow and it had been hit in the bow but evidently the bulkhead had held so they weren't sinking so they sent us a message signalled a message that they were going to try to make it to the azores so then we got these people in and we went full steam to catch up with the convoy now that particular ship was torpedoed again that night this time it sank it was picked up by another ship the name is in my book was an armed ancient cruiser and that in turn was torpedoed and it had three hundred people on board then and most of them were lost all the people we could have saved went down on that ship the second time and so we only had twelve from that what was this an atlantic convoy it was an atlantic convoy that was a very dangerous area off spain off gibraltar coming up to the north here when you had gone back to liverpool after sierra leone how is it determined what your next ship is how is the how is it determined what your next ship will be who makes that decision we didn't decide what your next trip would be or your next ship would be you were allocated this ship and the ministry of transport decided where it was going to go and so we were going backward and forward to america picking up arms and tanks at one time and then apples and things like that and fruits and all kinds of foodstuffs you know as well as arms and jeeps in boxes and things like that you know and then we went to italy to naples to supply the army there and when we got into port there was absolute devastation there were ships sunk all over the place anyway we unloaded these thirty ton sherman tanks and they brought down portable cranes to lift them it was quite a hairy business you know and then the harbour was in a bad state because the mole was damaged and so on you couldn't we had more or less a rough sea coming in there it was a bit hairy so those were some of the incidents but the convoys were the worst things really for tension and so on i mean to see ships being blown up along side you and people going on fire and people struggling to get off the ship and into boats when it was a half gale running and the ship was going up and down like that you know one ship next to us a passenger ship was hit and you could see women and children on this ship as well nothing we could do we were rescue ship in our line we weren't to go over there you know let's talk a bit about the configuration of the convoys how it was determined where you were in a convoy well this was all allocated before you left because there'd have a meeting between the commodore who was the vice admiral and the captains of all the merchant ships and also the escorts and they would decide then the convoy positions and places and also the escort duties now a problem was and i've mentioned it already the corvettes which were mass produced were very useful for depth charging when a submarine was underneath but when a submarine was on the surface in the early days certainly a submarine could do eighteen knots and the corvettes could do sixteen they could outrun them and so they could deal with them down below but not on the surface now destroyers were much better but then the destroyers were in short supply also the destroyers only had a limited range so they couldn't go all that far without re fuelling sometimes we re fuelled them ourselves from the ship we took our own oil and they would come alongside and we'd put a pipe on but the destroyers were much more useful but with the shortage they had to rely on these corvettes they weren't in the convoy they were on the periphery and so often the u boats would be inside the convoy and the escorts would be over there and we'd get frustrated why can't they do something ' but understandably they were trying to track with their asdic any underneath and trying to stop them coming in ahead but they weren't very effective what happened really was we needed air cover and to solve that problem we were fitted with a hawker hurricane on the ship on the foredeck blasted off by rockets because the focke wulf condors germans used to fly round the convoy spotting for the submarines you couldn't get at them no use having a walrus or something like that because that couldn't fight them so they put hurricanes on but the poor pilot had nowhere to land he had to ditch in the sea and hope he'd be picked up but then as the war moved on they developed merchant ships into mini aircraft carriers and grain ships carried about twelve planes and then later on they had more escort carriers and once we had air cover to a large extent the submarine menace dropped they were able to spot them coming in and then attack them you know but it wasn't there in the beginnings and there was a very dangerous sort of zone mid atlantic
