we said well that's just the top deck and that way rather well i didn't get onto well with it i couldn't somewhere i don't know i wasn't that weather cause i killed it right i don't know but i didn't i wasn't getting on too well with a crew so i thought well problem with a wisdom tooth so i thought i'll come second get off so when you say you were getting on very well with your crew i mean how does that manifest itself on a ship for somebody doesn't know what life is like on a ship how did you why did you feel that way well so funny feel like i'm like a marriage just gone wrong wish i could i mean i didn't problem with you too so i thought i'll use it to get off the ship but funny enough having said that that ship was club doesn't i'm very well and let ship was sunk and i've got all the next trip well lovely because everything's brand new everything was brand new so yeah that was just an ordinary resetting banks it wasn't how much is that been pumped through yours originally come from where was that sailing then well i will remember i mean we actually loaded and we didn't know where we're going but we loaded at least we come out the tanya the time to leith kavanagh to load and others general cargo and could turn out to be the torch effort where's my lg is where the yanks and the british went into algiers casablanca iran so well general cargo i mean a big zabol and general nike stores in general cargo well we just didn't know we were not told anything on their school so we just accepted it it wasn't till we got sorted down and there is a many that you did well you know who's involved in in so i mean that first trip we got through got into port to charge your car go and away back went back to newport in wales to another car go and away we went to see you again and we knew then we were going back to algiers again how can i ask you about cheers because it was my big convoy wasn't well it was i mean when we finally when we finally went to the straight at you well initially before we went we were actually bottom by the high level bomber coming over who is so high that i mean i didn't touch it but we had her on a date we had a rescue launch which we had pilot who i don't know where the lost and over one but they were going to crewe this via rescue crowd if any ship is in problem in the mediterranean as the idea well i said trip i mean might even got her a bucket out there with you if you wanted to drop a run which side you know when we used to dropping bombs but we're not used to being here where they're coming down so anyway anyway we finally got through escort come out of jubilee avenue distortion i didn't had a cruiser with it now but no we weren't we we we got a hit forehead and well i'm majorly i mean haven't been hit the hatch covers a blown up in the air there's a bit of timber which covers are as well as one come down one of one of the long bits of it landed on a wire which ran from the the final to the bridge well that sets office are in a long last on the siren is well i mean well listed to skip over immediately left the convoy and saud making for the shore this would be morris rent with a sort of a nice trip from houses where we make it all so panic aboard and i'm in these let's come up from it from the engine room with all the little suitcases tired of climate and i could we were listening getting in lifeboat so i mean well as it wasn't thinking so we had to get rifles out together come on you get back down below deck we're going we still under way so that was it whether he was he wasn't coming up i don't know what you were doing didn't know how well who did when you're hit you don't quite know it is i'm sure there's a list inasmuch as all you can see the car or just like guns and he just sliding into the mediterranean it's clear water you can see the staff just floating clear the whole now into a corvette left to convoy escort it just goes with you soon we listen to match using me but with one attack on the coast i always think i'm wondering whether that coastline minds but we made a body been listed we tied up alongside in algiers and the army was now established the show and i was coming to discharge the ship you know and as a direction everything and just well we got friendly with him and you know because i come up through the board and all this particular morning when he got you got stopped with the guys on the way out last night and he has thirteen pair of pants on obviously that's order i don't know we had nappy stores we never will it be everything reported here where is happy with you when they took it was your first reaction panic really happy what do you do it and i mean to take a list well i mean is it i mean when she stated you list the waters and going out so i mean i haven't said it is a list but you could still organise a hill to work well happy where i mean haven't got in now as i was telling the story there well finally having the army less discharge this cargo we then labour got in another part of the harbour and i'm in most of us usually we went ashore and everything well then there a bombing raid in harbour and em i think i think that i think the ship was in there as well and i think it's well overdue after sussex i'm not sure but i think there was a cruise and well i misheard haas we got hit the same exactly the same and she just broke up in harbour to just something hour and nobody was a lot of commotion got back i think i think he was having a shower something i sent her i don't know quite what happened there but anyway nobody was killed you got to do both reacting to real war situations now i mean with other ships i'm in a c u c i just try to put them i think i used to put a black flag up and has come through the convoy i just drop and depth charges and i mean eleven convoy a ship broke down some of the old very old and broke down i had to type into you by ariana the old ship would yorkshire would think you've been in because of movement of water surge of water when i dropped reduce seen ships being sent around you again we had that on and actually when i was on on on the one we pick up in convoy and a ship ahead got a song and worry you heard of them sign is a capricorn sorry you just logged on without don't know the situation there was a ship a tag throw a sterling boy to pick up pick up survivors yeah what what is a gun les corsa why did you go on there well it's a step in ghana wish i was a little increase in wages and i mean as i was on coastal strip so the other two receiving you was in charge of the country and you gotta rise in wages at this was done at leith and i mean in the end you have to go to see a little story there on a little costa and a video the skipper and to pass you out on on on this course the password and her and you had a fire of twelve different positions on the gun and the procedure if if the gunpowder park i mean according to the annual use it you just putting the safety and and under leaving the bloke in charge of it is just hope the breach took it out and side and then carried on with the lesson but i mean that that wasn't recordable but i mean if if they couldn't use it we couldn't pass with the say so anyway pass that i mean another one and i had to go in and one of these weather in charge was sitting and his rockets rockets each side and we say fire and you learning a trade you ever sit beside beside it one brought one side in charge here and is rockers with the pub do know where there is blood coming down his nose i'm in this when they go office
